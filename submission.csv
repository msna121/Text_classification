0,"I absolutly love this modle. It is soooooooo cool. I am a big Smarty Jones fan so this was a must have. It is not really made for playing with, more like on a display shelf. I half a special section for him.",Kids_games
1,"I love this parfum spray. I was very pleased at the price as well. This size bottle will last a very long time. This is an older cologne and it is difficult finding it in the store, if not impossible. Yet I found it with no problem on amazon.com. They are so reliable. I will definitely order again and again.Deborah of Tennessee",Perfumes
2,"We love this collar! It's sturdy, convenient, and beautiful! We've gotten many compliments on it!",Pet_care
3,"The game that made me the most competitive fool in the world.You can't start studying? Play a game of mastermind! If you win (like I always do), the empowering feeling will unblock the mental barriers and you'll be off. Smart kids grew up on this game. Ha.",Kids_games
4,Got this for my boyfriend after smelling it in Men's Fitness. Love the cologne on him and he loves it too! Not too overbearing but definitely smells great! I would definitely recommend this product.,Perfumes
5,It's not messy and seems to kill the fleas. I use it on furniture and on the carpet and it works well. The inverted feature is the best.,Hair_products
6,We bought our daughter the Leapster system for Christmas and purchased the charger to go with it to save money on batteries. It takes a few hours to charge it for 10 hours of play according to the directions...personally I think it lasts much longer than that. The only problem is you kind of have to wiggle the leapster on the charger to get the green light to come on. My 5 year old has figured out how to do this so it's not difficult. Other than that I think it's a great accessory.,Kids_games
7,"Not what we were looking for. We wanted a party game for older 20's and thirty somethings. I would say this game would be good for Jr. High. The ""hosts"" inside the box are super annoying and cheesy. The cards were really pretty easy compared to some of the other games we played. My sister got this game as a gift, we tried it once and she decided to return it. Like I said, I can see jr. high kids maybe getting into this, but otherwise, it was pretty lame.",Kids_games
8,"I have used many of the different shampoos for dandruff.NONE of the Head & Shoulder shampoos or Selsun Blues work. Tea Tree oil sort of helped. Sebulex sort of worked. And regular strength coal tar shampoos (.5%) sort of work.Prescription shampoos never worked for me.This stuff works. Really well. I have gone back to using other stuff and after a few days, the flakes are back.And if you follow it up with a H&S; conditioner, your hair won't stink like that weird smelling shampoo.It does smell weird, but with the conditioner, no problem.And I never flake anymore. Ever.",Hair_products
9,"This is a really great scent, but it could of been better. I think it misses that extra zing you get when you test it on animals. I mean seriously, animals want to smell nice too.",Kids_games
10,Gave as a gift and owner said her dog loves this....takes it everywhere and it is very sturdy!,Pet_care
11,"My only take about this cologne is that it is too strong.. I don't know how one of the reviewers before me reached the conclusion that it can be hardly detected. I would recommend spraying it only once and I guarantee you would still smell it at the end of the day. Being strong as it is, I think it is more suitable for winter unless you live in an air-conditioned environment. I own this cologne in addition to Hugo Boss, Aqua de Gio by Armani, Addias Adrenaline. This, in addition to the Hugo boss and the aqua de Gio are equally my favorites.",Perfumes
12,"Although this food does have good quality ingredients, my German Shepherd never really had any solid stools while on it. While switching him to this food, he had diarrhea even though I switched him over VERY slowly. I still stayed with the food thinking that the diarrhea had to do with switching the main meat component from lamb to chicken. After three months on it though, his stools are still mostly runny. I have since change to the Taste of the Wild which he actually love to eat (it smells pretty good too) and his stools are improving. This does not mean that Blue Buffalo is not a good choice for your dog. Rather I would try it out and see how your dog does on it. If you find that their stools are not improving then switch.",Pet_care
13,This works just as described. I had no trouble putting it together and my cats are already using it more than their old boxes. It's so easy. Honestly can't imagine why we ever did it any other way.,Pet_care
14,Not a believer at first but it surprised me I'm buying again that's all you need to know if you want to get rid of your dandruff. Get this!!,Perfumes
15,"I bought this curling iron simply because I wanted try a cermaic iron and because it's made from helen of Troy, which is a manafacturer of many professional styling tools. My normal curling iron is the Conair Instant Heat series. I gave this iron 3 star because I find that it doesn't heat up or get as hot as the Conair instant heat --and as far as less frizz and flyaway...well, it's about the same as the Conair Instant Heat (which is chrome barrel). I returned it and bought the Conair Ceramic curling iron, and yup the Conair one is certainly hotter (95W Conair vs 80W Revlon) which means it takes less time for me to get a curl :D",Pet_care
16,"These clippers are very quiet. They did not stress out my dog. They did not pinch, pull or bind up. I am very glad I purchased them. The price is good for what you get. They are worth it.",Perfumes
17,"Seems to be working well, keeps my puppy safe--He wants to be up where he can see out and he is. He tried to get out the first few times but it does snap onto his harness so he couldn't get completely out of it. I just wish it would support more than 30 lbs. He's a lab and will outgrow quickly.",Pet_care
18,"Our puppy can become very excited on walks when meeting other dogs or people. It has kept her from pulling while training her to walk properly and if she does get excited, it restrains her without choking her and straining her neck. It's very easy to adjust and put on her and has held up well for us.",Pet_care
19,I purchased this container after I bought the larger one [80 pounds] for his food. This was bought to house all of his treats and keep them safe from any and all animal teeth. I stack it on top of his larger container instead of having the bags on the top shelf on my rack in the kitchen. I had a mouse who feasted on the treats daily. Now it's dead from starvation. The lid is perfect and so is the size. I recommend this to all animal lovers and pet owners the world over. Worth every penny. Thanks Amazon.Com!,Pet_care
20,"Our baby, Ruby, loves this toy. She loves to do a ""drive by"" which is running by and swatting at it . . . so cute!",Kids_games
21,"Since I'm a woman, it seems like any time anyone doesn't know what to get me, they resort to body sprays and lotions because all women are supposed to like those, I think. As a result of that, I have years' worth of body sprays sitting around and going bad because I just don't like them. But this one is different.This smells more like the stem and leaves of the tomato plant, so it's an earthy yet refreshing scent. I always get questions and compliments about this spray. I love that it's not flowery or fruity. It's probably not something a super girly-girl would like, but for someone who doesn't like the usual scents, this is perfect.",Hair_products
22,"I have been using Stuff-a-Ball toys for years. They're durable, and can entertain dogs for hours if properly stuffed. We have a variety of small and/or breakable dog treats that can be crammed inside. The more it's stuffed, the longer it will last as your dog chews on the pliable rubber--it's good for their gums, too! Read the packaging to make sure you order the right size for your dog.",Pet_care
23,it's one of the best games my friends and me ever tried - after getting used how the rules work it was a lot of fun.please beware of the potentially confusing rulebook and directly refer to the manufacturers website...additionally consider that for players who are totally new to this kind of board-games you have to calculate at least 2-3 hours to get through the rules,Kids_games
24,"I love Biosilk. This product is great for any hair type. Just a tiny dab (about the size of a green pea) on damp hair keeps my hair soft and silky under the most adverse conditions- blow drying, swimming pools, you name it. This is also great rubbed into your skin. Leaves you soft and silky all over. I also appreciate the way it tames dry flyaway hair. Try it, you will love it, too!",Pet_care
25,I think this could be a great bag if you are not traveling far or have a very relaxed pet. Our 11 pound dog managed to chew threw the mesh siding about 20 minutes into our 5 hour flight. I think if the mesh was more durable it would be a great bag. I just feel I cannot give it better then a 1 star rating because we paid alot of money for this carrier to last 20 minutes. We had to purchase a different carrier to fly home with.,Pet_care
26,"This is my pets second crate given that she broke her first one by trying to put a door mat into the crate when she was home alone. I love the option of the two doors, our first crate only had one and was not convient (I had failed to think about the door location during my first purchase). Bella fits perfectly in the crate and sleeps very comforably, not cramped at all. Bella has the 30Lx21Wx24H which is perfect for her, she is a medium sized dog (Lab and Beagle mix).",Pet_care
27,One of my dogs is very picky. She liked this. I was shocked. I was able to find it at Winco for 10.68-2.00 coupon on bag.,Pet_care
28,"A friend brought Whoonu to my house one night, and we wound up playing many rounds in rapid succession. It was such a riot that I had to buy the game to play with my family--people get really emotional about their choices! I would seriously love to ask anyone I ever could to play Whoonu, because it's a game absolutely anyone can play, and it's the best way I can think of to learn about someone while letting them know things about yourself too.Whoonu is an awesome ""get-to-know-you"" game--I don't know what's better, using it to become better acquainted with people you barely know personally or using it to learn more about people you think you already know like a book. The beauty of it is, it works for any group of people! Whether you're extremely close yet or not, the game is super fun and invites silliness. I only wish there could be infinitely many cards! I've never seen a game like Whoonu before. It's all about getting to know each other's favorite things--and you'll probably be shocked at how the things get ranked sometimes!I also love a somewhat similar game, Imaginiff, which I say is similar because it also focuses on the particular players, and/or people they know. It asks you to basically make a judgment on the other person's personality or likes by selecting what they would be ""if they were a ____"" on each card. Only, in that one, the person in question has less power--their own choices for themselves matter less than the choice that was picked by the majority of other players. It's the opposite in Whoonu, and I like that you get to determine the winners by sharing your actual favorite things. Still, if you enjoy Whoonu and this type of game, I'd offer Imaginiff as an additional recommendation. I would say that Whoonu is better if you've got a lot of younger people in your crowd and for those with limited attention spans, however, as it's been my experience that just about anyone will grasp the Whoonu concept very quickly and eagerly play several rounds in a row, because they go fast. Imaginiff tends to go on much, much longer, an entire game probably equaling many rounds of Whoonu, and while this doesn't bother me, I have on occasion had a harder time keeping everyone put 'til the end.The fun never ends with Whoonu--my groups love to mix it up and play one round choosing the ""Whoozit""'s favorites, and the next round, picking their least favorites! In that case, you select what you believe the person hates, and the thing they like LEAST gets the most points. Often, you'll have an awful hand for the person you're doing at the moment, because you think they hate (or if you're playing backwards, love) everything you've got. Or maybe you expect them not to care about any of your choices one way or another, or--well, anything can happen. And believe it or not, times like those make it even MORE fun! Playing Whoonu can really tell you a lot about somebody, and always makes a wildly hilarious game for parties or small get-togethers or whatever, so long as you have 3-6 players at a time. With very little set-up, it's incredibly simple and therein lies its genius. Every player gets to be Whoozit, so every player guesses for every other player before the game ends. Plus, the numbered tokens are cool, resembling wavy vegetable chips. Again, I would gladly play this game with just about anyone, and I'm glad I found out about it--I strongly recommend it to anyone, too!",Kids_games
29,"I am pretty happy with this purchase. It has worked exactly as expected. I have been using this to store my dog food for a couple of months now. I like that the wheels let me roll it around easily and the airtight seal keeps the dog food smell contained. I do wish it was a little taller though, as the big 35-40 pound bags of dog food are a bit difficult to squish down in this when they are new. They will fit, but it is difficult to fully close the container with a brand new bag and I sometimes wonder if I am going to put too much stress on the lid or the seal by forcing it down in order to latch it, although it has not appeared to do any damage yet. Even with this minor issue, I am actually planning to buy a second one now, since my two dogs now eat different foods for health reasons. I have not had any issues with this item so far and although I don't absolutely love it, it does what it says and gets the job done. I do think the price is a little high, but still lower than what I remember other similar products being when I bought this several months ago.",Pet_care
30,"This is not a terribly expensive product and for the price, it works ok. It easily fit my Jeep Cherokee--no need for the extensions which was nice. However, it required modifications for it to stay in place. The screws which are supposed to hold the cross pieces in place do not tighten enough and my dog was able to push between the cross pieces and slide them apart! My husband used clamps to secure the cross pieces and they now work fine. The device could use some spring tension to tighten it between floor and ceiling as well because it can get knocked out of place (without even loosening). All that being said, if you are handy with a few tools, this barrier works well and is rather streamlined and unobtrusive.",Pet_care
31,"There really isn't a negative thing I can say about this product. I love the ceramic iron, and once you've used ceramic, you really can't go back to regular metal. And having a straightener and a huge roller all in one is a great idea! Also, my hair is naturally wavy, so this iron tames it and give it a little body where I want it, and not where I don't!I actually ordered this as a replacement to my old one, which I had for at least 5 years. But my toddler threw it on the ground and broke it, so for the time I had to wait for it to be shipped to me, it was like losing an arm!",Pet_care
32,"I have a black lab and mini eskimo spitz and they both love dingo munchy stix! These are great for a quick treat or snack, but if your dog needs more of a ""chewing workout"" try the mini bones or rawhides instead. These munchy stix come in 2 flavors",Pet_care
33,"Bella, a fun-loving black lab pup that loves to bark at anyone who doesn't pay attention to her, only needed to get sprayed twice before stopping the barking. She still barks, but now it's only when she should be barking. And since it's not harmful, I was happy to try it. I would recommend this product!",Pet_care
34,This is the correct replacement flap for the petsafe large dog door. Worked fine and the door is like new.,Pet_care
35,"This game is terrific and can be enjoyed by kids and adults too. It helps familiarize players with African geography, and is a lot of fun. The game does not require any prior knowledge about Africa. Check the cards when you open the game. The first one we purchased (at a store - not via Amazon) had some sort of manufacturing default and we had too many plane cards and almost no truck cards. Since then we've purchased this game for ourselves and as a gift with no problems. We've also played the 10 Days in Europe and 10 Days in USA versions which are good fun too.",Kids_games
36,"I was nervous when buying this because I wasnt sure if this was the whole set or just replacements- I was pleased when it arrived and was the whole set.My dog has a great time with this toy. The little squirrels inside the trunk are squeaky toys, which she LOVES. The box came with instructions on how to modivate and teach your pet to use it. We put a small treat in the bottom and she had a great time digging it out. The whole process for removing the squirrels takes her less than a minute now, so if there is not a human near by to restock the trunk, she moves on to something else. This is not something I would leave her with and expect it to keep her occupied for the day.I would say that if your pet enjoys this general type of play (stuffed things, digging, hide and seek) this is an EXCELLENT toy and alot of fun.",Pet_care
37,"We had tried the Shed-Ender which was terrible, an awful waste-of-money. A guy up the street had recommended the FURminator, and I found it cheap here on Amazon, but it certainlt would be worth twice the price!!! Works bloody well on my long-haired terrier mix. My short haired pit doesn't like it too much (he's a bit precious), but it takes off his undercoat like no brush ever seen! A true find!!!!",Pet_care
38,"Just a Great Toy. Our Son loves making music and dancing along, and there is enough variety of sounds and songs that it doesn't drive you crazy as a parent. Seams real sturdy and durable. A great learning toy, like most leapfrog stuff we've come across so far.",Kids_games
39,"Ah, chutes and ladders. A classic.It takes just minutes to learn but a lifetime to master the strategy.And you never know from game to game exactly how the child you play with will attempt to cheat this time, so it is always exciting. By the way, remind me to tell you about my ingrown toenail. Actually, on second thought, I prefer that nobody know about it, it's a little embarrassing. So, never mind.[...]. You know, for being a game I played as a kid that kids still play. But other reviewers have pointed out that young kids constantly get turned around going up the ladders and down the chutes. That's true, I'll dock a star for that, it does make it a hard game to play with any kid young enough to be interested in playing it. They could put little arrows across the bottoms of the rows to help people along, or a little trail of footprints or something cute like that. Still, kids do gravitate towards this game, they seem to like the little subplots around each chute and ladder, little stories of rewards and consequences.",Kids_games
40,"My daughter loves playing this game with her dad, and is not bored with it after 6 months of play. Great value.",Kids_games
41,"This is, by far, my kittens favorite ball!! He never stops batting it around! It does make a lot of noise on a tile or linoleum floor, so we take it away at bedtime!!",Pet_care
42,We love playing Michigan rummy on an old set that is kept at the beach house - been there for 30 years - but it was hard to find another new version of the game. Tripoley is a good substitute. Fun and easy to play for the whole family!,Kids_games
43,this is the cooliest thing ever! and it doesnt mader how old u r because i saw people who have it and the like 20! not kidding! and i saw on the computer that even jamie leen spears( brittney spearses sister!)and a lot of other stars have them! so if famouse people have them then its cool!so if u never got any of them before then get he 1st one first then get the 2ndV then get the 3rdV so u can get used to them! well have fun with them! i know u will!(...),Kids_games
44,"I played this game as a kid, and agree with the other reviewer in that the spinner comes off all the time (my eight year old daughter had a hard time getting it to spin properly), and the thing is flimsy. The ""people"" fell out of the cars almost every move... Does Milton Bradley have a deluxe version out there we can get instead? I would gladly pay an extra chunk of my hard earned money to get a real board and not have to reassemble it each time.Good luck",Kids_games
45,"Our grand daughter Sara is into stuffed animals, the bigger the better, so when she saw this it brought a big smile to her face and at night when it sleeps with her, he keeps the monster out.",Kids_games
46,"My 31 month old son likes to play Chutes & Ladders, but still needs some help counting the right number of squares to move forward. But when I gave him this game yesterday, he wanted to play it all day long, and first thing this morning when woke up, he said he wanted to play the ""cherry game"" again! Picking the bright red cherries is fun for him and makes counting very tangible and easy to do for a little guy his age. Two thumbs up!",Kids_games
47,"I love this box! It is so easy to use, it makes life much easier. I have two cats, and using a scoop to clean their box was horrible. I had to scoop almost every day. The Omega box is so much easier, and I actually don't mind doing it.",Pet_care
48,"We've had this for over a year now, and it's still working just as amazing as the first day!",Pet_care
49,"I have two cats and foster at least one more at any given time. It can get quite busy in the litter boxes after their breakfast and dinner, so I've been looking for a second, bigger litterbox than the smallest of the two I currently have. I decided to try the Booda Dome, and if they hated it, well, fifteen bucks was worth a try. To my surprise, all three of the cats immediately took to it. They were climbing in and out of it before I had it assembled or put the litter in. As soon as I put it together and poured the litter in they immediately started scratching and using it. In fact when I went to clean out the two litter boxes today, I scooped ten times more clumps out of the Booda Dome than my regular open litter box.Pros:-Cats took to it immediately-Comes with a liner and filter, and the replacements are cheap-Filter helps with odor a LOT (as does the wheat litter I use)-Small round size lets it fit almost anywhere-The cats seem to enjoy the extra privacyCons:-My large cat (a long slender 12.5 pound tabby) has to stick his head out when he does his business (its rather adorable to see his little face, though, especially when he has his ""concentrating"" face on), so it is a wee bit small. My other two cats, the 7lb and 8lb kittens do absolutely fine with it and seem to prefer it over the other litter box.",Pet_care
50,Product works very well for me. I have fine hair and it holds and gives volume without damage and stickiness. Love it.,Pet_care
51,"I was skeptical when a friend raved about this treat for our cats, but she was absolutely right!! They love all the flavors--we mostly use chicken, salmon & cod. Great enticement to crumble over their canned food when they think you're giving them inferior food not worthy of their little palates (even when you're feeding the good stuff!). If I could rate this stuff 10 Stars on behalf of my Abyssinians, I would do so!!! They think this stuff is manna from the heavens.",Pet_care
52,"This is the first collar we bought after extensive research. We are thorougly pleased. We watched the video that came with it, and our dog responded so well with the training as presented on the video. We also use it for too much barking, although the video recommends a different product for continual barking. It was so important that our dog be well-trained (she is a fierce-looking black german shepherd) because we wanted others to be comfortable approaching her. (She is really a big baby and wouldn't hurt anything.) She has ceased jumping up on people, running after dogs, barking at anything going by, pulling us on walks, etc. You do have to invest the time to train as the video suggests. Our dog responded quickly. Definately worth the money.",Pet_care
53,This is our favorite game to play together as a family. My daughter is 7 and my son is 5. We take it everywhere we go. It was a big hit on our beach vacation. It is a perfect birthday gift along with something else small.I would buy two packs though as the cards run out fast with 4 playing.Enjoy.We also play the game Spot It for more laughs - simpler but another one that we can all play together.,Kids_games
54,"My puppy (Rhodesian Ridgeback) was able to pull all the squirrels out within a few minutes. Furthermore, within 5 hours of playing, she had the stuffing torn out of 2 of the 3 squirrels.",Pet_care
55,We bought this toy in October O8 for my grandson for Christmas. I took it out to put batteries in it and it blue screened. It did not work at all. So I went through the trouble shooting and then called Vtech on December 9 08. They said they would send a call tag to pick up the game and when they get it back they will ship me a new one. Well today is the 16th and still no call tag. I called again today because there is no way a new one will be here by Christmas if I have to wait for them to get me a tag and wait for it to get to them before they ship UPS ground for Christmas. It's their policy they keep saying. Then I asked to talk with the supervisor and was told the Sup would call me at 5:30 central time today. No such call happened. I am fed up with this company and will no longer buy their products.,Pet_care
56,"This product is okay. I feel like my hair needs to be damp, not totally wet, to spray on and then continually scrunch and play with so it doesn't weigh down my hair.",Pet_care
57,"This toy has a very poorly designed rip cord. If you don't pull it fast enough, the doll just spins. If it is pulled too hard it won't do too much there either. It worked great for a few pulls as the doll went at least 10-15 feet into the air.After those few pulls however, the rip cord started to not work very well as it became more and more difficult to pull and even had difficulty retracting back into the base.We have a 5 and an 8 year old, and they both had a difficult time pulling the rip cord to begin with, but once the rip cord got hung up even I had difficulty getting it to operate as well. Sometimes the cord could only be pulled back a few inches and sometimes hardly at all.Overall, this toy had potential, but the poorly designed rip cord is a big disappointment.",Kids_games
58,"This teddy bear is adorable and has been the center of attention for both of my dogs. We bought it for our puppy since she is teething, but both dogs play tug of war with this stuffed toy and so far, it has not shredded one bit. We have a pomeranian puppy (about 6 pounds) and a pekingnese beagle (about 20 pounds). The older dog is an aggressive chewer and he did not break this yet (which was very surprising!). I even washed this in the machine and it still is in perfect shape. Next time, I will get this in a darker color because it looks dingy already and its brand new. I definitely recommend this for puppies and dogs alike.",Pet_care
59,"I've used this product a lot over the years, but every time I've use it for a while, I move back to gel. Basically, the forming creme does a good job of keeping your hair controlled, but there downside is that your forehead will become ultra-greasy as the work day plods on. By close of business, your whole face feels quite a bit oilier than it would without this product.I recommend the creme, but also recommend that on those days when you do use it, that you wash your hair and face at the end of the day; otherwise, your complexion will start to suffer and your scalp might become irritated.I recently switched over to TIGI Bed Head After-Party Smoothing Cream for Silky, Shiny, Healthy Looking Hair! 3.4 oz, which doesn't feel greasy at all and makes your hair feel softer. I'll probably stick with that, despite the higher cost.",Pet_care
60,"This is such a great game, especially for 20 and 30 year olds. A great way to start off the evening if you don't know some of the people - everyone gets a little silly! Don't forget to buy batteries!",Kids_games

62,"This is a great representation of Admiral Ozzel, the Imperial officer who learnt that coming out of hyperspace too early isn't a good career move. Moreover, in my opinion, it's also perhaps the best representation of any Imperial officer ever put out by Hasbro. Rather than simply a smooth olive-green uniform, Ozzel's uniform actually has a texture that feels like cloth. He has a decent amount of articulation for a 2004 figure. My only complaint is that he can't ever fully straighten his arm, especially his left arm, which is positioned at an acute angle. It's not a significant problem, but would have been nice to have gotten a greater range of motion.",Kids_games
63,"CUTE COLOR, NICE SUEDE. KITTY ATE THRU THE CLIP AND IT WAS OFF WITHIN 3 DAYS. CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE!!",Pet_care
64,"As someone having to wear a patch for months and months I was looking for something big enough that my eye woudn't rub on it but not so huge as most of the patches out there. I would say that this patch is good in the sense that you can control the tension on your head, and it does fit under glasses.",Pet_care
65,My order was received and delivered as ordered and expected. No problems! I'm satisfied.,Perfumes
66,"I received this cat condo quickly. After reading the reviews I knew that using four screws would make putting it together much easier. Putting it together was a breeze, as the screws tightened, the top attached neatly to the bottom. My cat loves her new home.",Pet_care
67,"OK normally I follow age guidelines very strictly, but my 7mo is intent on walking and hasn't been giving me, daddy, or the every patient kitty a break with using us as walkers. Almost as soon as I had this out of the box, she is standing with it. Before I even got the toe stickers on she is taking her first heditant steps behind it. Yes sometimes its a little fast for her and she goes boom on her bottom, but always with a giggle and a pull back up on her inteli-block than a few more steps with her hippo.Originally I got this since I had a coupon and was just going to put it in the closet until she was ready, but she LOVES it. HOwever I am keeping it on thick carpet to keep it as slow as possible. She is no where near ready to take this thing for a spin on the tile.",Kids_games
68,"My mom has been using ""Beautiful"" for years and loves it.I love being able to get her her favorite perfume as a gift and her not knowing about it.",Pet_care
69,"This game is go for little kids because it helps with numbers. I play this game when I can, and my family likes it.",Kids_games
70,"I was very excited for this item to arrive after hearing how much my son enjoyed it at daycare. Unfortunately, we don't use it very often as the sock does not fit over his hand very well. Seems too small. It would be great if they stretched more.",Pet_care
71,"I've tried a million foods on my dogs, including Castor & Pollux's other foods. This has been by far the best. They gobble it up, but more importantly, it seems to be really good for them. As another reviewer mentioned, their stool is perfect, small and easy to pick up. For one of my dogs it's the only thing that doesn't give her diarrhea (sorry, but these are the gross details you need to know about a dog food :-)). Recently I ran out of Organix so I gave them a corn-based food for a while and they started getting bad breath almost immediately. As soon as I switched back, it was gone. They're even calmer than they were on other foods, which I think may not have fully satisfied them.Note that while this food has a lot of organic ingredients, which is great, the chicken meal is not organic and probably takes up the most weight (the organic chicken is likely mostly water). I appreciate that Organix now specifies that ""only"" 70% of its ingredients are organic. This is much better than you'll get from most brands while still being affordable, and it's just a fantastic food. I won't feed my dogs anything else.",Pet_care

78,"Hi,I am on the 3rd one of these CD-players in 4 month. My son loves it, it's the first thing he turnes on in the morning and the last toy he turns off at night. That's the only reason why I keep trying. The first of these CD-players played 3 or 4 CD's once each, then it was no longer able to read them. I went back to the store and exchanged it a week after my son got it for his 2nd birthday. The next CD-player started the same problem 2 month after the exchange, first I thought it's the occational scratch on one or two CDs but by the 4th month it didn't read any CD's anymore. The seller told me that they will not exchange the item another time. I think that 4 month for a $69.99 item is a bit stiff. The CD-player comes with no manufacturer's warranty. Otherwise great item, looks great, my son learned to sing tons of songs and talkes about ""lissening to Mozart and Vivaldi"". The CD-player has has an anti shock system but that was never needed in our household. My toddler learned to operate the player in minutes. The other downside is that there is no locking mechanism for the CD compartment, so we had to teach the kid not to touch the CDs. I really hope that this 3rd CD-player holds up longer, it breaks my son's heart not to be able to turn on his music.",Kids_games

94,"Our house has an open floorplan, and we were needing something to block our new puppy from our bedroom. We read all the most helpful reviews first, and then decided on this gate that -- with extensions -- would barricade a 44"" wide space. Our installation would be at about a 20-degree angle in order to use both our fireplace and a doorframe as ""walls,"" and we were hopeful, but not very. Thanks to the many hints, it took only one person to get the installation *successfully* accomplished in less than 10 minutes. The rubber caps are large enough in diameter to grab both the brick and the painted wood surfaces, even at an angle. We didn't even need to use (but didn't toss!) the optional endcaps. This gate is quite rigid and immobile when installed, and seems rugged in construction. The bars are less than 3"" apart, which has stymied even our cat. We consider this a plus! The gate features a small pet door centered in the gate, which we won't be using now; but may, if we need this in another area for a different purpose. For all its permanent feeling, it is easily loosened to move wherever. This gate was an exceptional value, about $7 cheaper than WalMart (where it was out of stock), and shipped for free to my door, three days earlier than expected.

It's one of the few toys I've saved between kids and I'll most likely keep it for all my future kids and grandkids!I take issue with the complaints that children don't play with the toy ""properly"". Are we dictating how children should play, now, too, as well as learn?? Even babies have to follow the rules and do things according to someone else's pre-determined idea of ""proper development""? PLEASE!! Let's let babies be babies. True learning is self-directed, not teacher or parent directed.Yes, toddlers usually prefer to dump the blocks out and put them back in without the lid at first, maybe for quite a while. They also love putting other stuff in the bucket. What's wrong with that? When they're older they usually figure out the shape-sorting aspect on their own and become enthralled with that for a while. If they never use the toy as a shape-sorter so what? They'll still learn their shapes on their own without you ""teaching"" them and they'll learn whatever other ""skills"" this toy is supposed to teach as well. Can we not try to controll our kids' learning at such a young age - there's enough of that later for most kids.This toy is a useful learning tool, though not neccesarily in the way every parent will want. It's also fun and relatively cheap and more durable than a cardboard box or some homemade alternatives. If you can allow your child to use it as they desire I highly recommend it. If you feel your toy ""investment"" must pay off with a pre-determined ""learning objective"" on a pre-determind timetable then maybe you better skip it.",Kids_games

131,"The Smart Splash Sail Away Shapes are a pretty good set of boats that teaches the concepts of colors and shapes. My son first started playing with this set when he was about a year old. Now, as a 2-year-old, he is able to quickly match the shapes without any problems. Each boat has a cutout of a shape (circle, square, triangle, etc.). The bottom of each sail has a corresponding shape that fits into the boats. When it was brand new, my son had some problems pulling out the sails and fitting them inside the cutouts of the boats because the fit was pretty tight. However, after many uses, it became a little easier to push the sails into the boats, and by that time, my son had developed a little more strength in his fingers to wedge the sails in.The boats are all very colorful and attractive. The boats themselves are made from a thick rubbery material that is kind of soft at the top and bottom of the boats; I was able to push down a little on them with my fingers. Each of the boat's sails are made from a hard plastic material. My son played with these boats so much, every time he took a bath, that one of the bottoms of the boat developed a crack in it. I had to eventually throw out that boat because of a little bit of mold that collected inside over time. Another downside to this set is that the boats don't link together very well when they are floating in the water. The motion of the water causes them to become separated quite easily, but this is not a very big deal for me. My son was happy to just float the boats individually in the water.Overall, these boats are a good set of toys for bath time. They are educational and, over time, they help young toddlers strengthen their cognitive and fine motor skills. Plus, they are fun to play with in the bath tub.",Kids_games

137,"In 2004 my weekly hair cuts in NYC was approaching $20 + tips and to save money I bought this clipper for $25. My purchase was on a trial basis because if I couldn't learn to use it without butchering my hair it was getting returned. The Wahl HomePro Adjustable was very quick to learn and is very easy to use for regular folks cutting their own hair in their bathrooms.Every Friday morning I've used it to cut my naturally short and curly hair during the last 7 years without any issues. Even when I went to London and Paris in the summers I took it along with a travel adapter. In Paris it worked but in London the AC/DC current was different and the Wahl would vibrate super fast to use safely. So I bought a comparable European clipper at Boots Pharmacy that I keep at my Aunt's house in North London.During the previous few weeks my Wahl was not cutting sharp like it used to. I unscrewed the shear plates and cleaned it out with clipper oil. Still the shears were hardly cutting my hair because it had gotten dull from 7 years of continuous use. I un-boxed and starting using an Emerson clipper that my brother got me a few years ago for Christmas. It was then that I realized how good my HomePro Adjustable was. The Emerson felt like a plastic toy in comparison. I went out and bought another Wahl Homepro brand clipper but found it impossible to use because it lacked the adjustable lever. So I came back to amazon and bought the exact model I had before.After 7 years of use it has proven to be the best thing ever and I 100% recommend it.At $20 + 5 tip x 52 weeks x 7 years I saved $9,100 on account of spending $25 to buy the Wahl HomePro Adjustable.PROS:-Has a nice hefty weight to it which gives it a good balance and feel in your hands.-Super easy to use, blades are smooth and comfortable to the touch.-Comes with adequate attachments and instruction VHS.-Shear blades dismantle easily and quickly for cleaning and replacement.-Easy to travel with.-Proven Lifetime quality.-Great price and value for what you are paying for.-Adjustable Lever makes a HUGE difference for fine tuning your hair cuts.CONS:-I couldn't find replacement shear blades anywhere for this particular model and the ones I did see for other Wahl models cost as much as an entire new Wahl clipper.-Over the years I learned Clipper Oil is crucial to the performance of the blades but the kit comes with a one-time use miniscule tube of clipper oil. Some other clippers come with free big bottles of the stuff but you will have to buy your own here.-Did not work in the UK because of the AC/DC current differences.-I wished the power cord was longer but if you get an extension cord you can easily remedy this.-It is not a quiet clipper but it is not super loud either. I noticed some folks commented on newer model clippers being silent.This is not a con for me but still it will be for those that like to cut their hair in their local Library.-For those looking to cut the hair 'down below' keep in mind this is not a small clipper. It vibrates quickly and is louder than smaller clippers. Also the edges of the shear blades protrude out some and are pointy and sharp. So any soft and sensitive areas below your belly button and above your knees you may want to approach with caution.",Pet_care

143,"I started using this product approximately 7 years ago after reading an article promoting Desert Essence products. I have found it the best to handle any type skin. It does it all. Cleanses, conditions, and controls blemishes. It is concentrated and a little bit goes a long way. Your skin feels clean and healthy, not stripped and irritated as some other cleansers.I have always purchased it at the health food store in the smaller pump style at a fairly high price. Until I found it here on Amazon, I didn't realize it came it the large economy size. Price was great, shipping cost was more than reasonable, and I received the product quickly. At this price I can afford to use it for bathing as well. Great product at a fantastic price, need I say more?",Pet_care
144,"I couldn't wait to get this for my daughter. I bought it for her last Christmas when she had just turned 2. She was already able to recoginize letters and numbers at that point, so I thought this would be great. She loves it!!! The only problem is that we are on our third one in less than a year and this one is giving us problems. The first one was exchanged at Toys-R-Us, no problem. The next two by Leap Pad themselves. I wouldn't mind the problems if my daughter abused the leap pad. She doesn't!!! It stays in a basket with all of the cassets and books when not in use.(This way they are all in one place!) It is frustrating to her when the machine suts down on it's own; says ""This is not a my first leap pad cartridge"" and it is; and the pen doesn't always work. Call me crazy, but I'm about to purchase the regular leap pad because I think it has more to offer her now.

147,"This game was bought for my son for his birthday to accompany his brand new leapster 2. It plays through the intro and freezes up upon starting actual game play. To rate this on its educational value is pointless unless it is providing a lesson in aggravation. We returned our first copy to the store. With the second copy, and third copy, same thing happened. All the while other games my son received work perfectly. We contacted Leapster. They sent us a new copy of the same game. Same thing all over again. I have had it. I contacted them and requested a different game. The flaw is in the programming. No other game does this in my son's leapster console.

150,"Like some of the other reviewers, I did a lot of research before deciding on this food. (Want your eyes opened? Read ""7 Scary Things You Didn't Know about Your Pet's Food."" But if you're reading about this product, you probably are already aware of the low quality of grocery store cat foods.) My cat is a dry food addict and though I've tried every (healthy) suggestion out there, I cannot convince him that wet food is anything other than a snack. So I decided to at least feed him the healthiest dry food that I can afford rather than Meow Mix.There are some better dry cat foods, but they are only a little bit better and they're a lot more expensive. Some of them cost $10 a pound. At that price, I'd be better off feeding my cat from the meat department at the grocery store. Free range, organic chicken doesn't even cost $10 a pound. (Amusingly I just spotted where Amazon.com claims a list price for the 6 pound bag of the Chicken Soup Cat Senior as $149.49. That's $24.92 a pound!! You could feed your cat steak for less than that.)This is a high quality cat food with an ingredient list to put a smile on your face. For what you're getting, the price is reasonable though it's still more than the Meow Mix. The product is not carried locally. So I was happy when I found it on Amazon.com, as since this item qualifies for free shipping, that is what makes it affordable to me. (If I had to pay the over $14 shipping on it, I'd be better off going to the pet store and buying Blue Buffalo at $2.29 a pound. With the free shipping the Chicken Soup is $1.57 a pound. Without the free shipping it's $2.36 a pound.)Those were my reasons for choosing Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul from Amazon.com.Now how did my Meow Mix loving cat feel about it? When I opened the door and carried in the first box, my cat immediately started rubbing up against it and acting all excited. I had had this plan to slowly transition the cat by mixing it with the Meow Mix. But he was so enthusiastic just at the smell that I immediately opened the box, cut open the bag and offered him a handful. He dove right in. He absolutely loved it! (Now I was bit taken aback. I was so used to multi-shape, multi-color cat food. This food has no dyes. All the kibbles are the same X-shape and they're all brown.)I never did finish that last bag of Meow Mix. I just started putting 100% Chicken Soup in the bowl. I just ordered his third bag and he still loves it every single day.The cat used to throw-up the Meow Mix every so often. But I haven't seen him vomit up the Chicken Soup at all. So apparently it agrees with him better. I haven't noticed any kind of stool problem. (But to be fair, the cat didn't have diarrhea on the Meow Mix either.)I feed him the same amount as I did the Meow Mix",Pet_care
151,"Let's just say I was skeptical. My friends used to marvel at my collection of used cosmetics and cleansers. After 20 years of trying every cleanser I possibly could on the market, from upmarket to cheap cleansers, I still hadn't found the perfect one and thought I never would. Every cleanser I use either dried my skin out, or made me break out. Anyway, I was getting desperate and began looking at reviews of face cleansers and stumbled across this one. I frankly had never heard of it (it's always on the bottom shelves at the drug stores) and probably would never have tried it because of it's boring packaging. Anyway, after reading tons of good reviews on various sites, I bought some and have been using it for about 3 months now. I can't believe the difference! This cleanser is honestly the best cleanser I've ever used. It doesn't have any unnecessary fragrances or other ingredients, it keeps my skin soft and smooth, I don't break out, I save money on moisturizer because I don't have to slather it on anymore, it removes my makeup easily and I LOVE IT!!! I wish I would have found this 20 years ago before I wasted all my money on those bottles of cleansers. My skin actually glows now. I highly recommend this product to everyone. You won't regret trying this.",Hair_products
152,"Just a warning,,as someone else stated this will not stop an agressive attack nor will it stop a pitbull. I have a greyhound that was attacked by a pitbull and I actually had to jump on the pitbull and wrestle it off as the direct stop was no more effective then spraying the pit with Chanel number 5. Once we were ""attacked"" but some little yappy mutt type dog and it did make the dog hesitate for a few moments which was long enough for us to get away ( generally greyhounds won't fight) but if you are looking for something to stop a real all out attack, this won't do it. I am pretty sure the directions even state it will stop mild to moderately agressive attacks ( it also says it won't work on bears,,,well duh) so you know what you are getting. I carry pepper spray rather then this product,,however one more thing. Pepper spray can blow back on the user, if Direct Stop does you'll never know it.",Pet_care

His normal mode is very ugly, his cab mode does a poorjob of hiding his head and arms. His mini-vechiles don't transform at all, they only make up his arms and legs in super form (Megazord) and they can be swapped around, otherwise they are useless. Energon and Armada Optimus Primes are the worst Primes to ever come out.

I've been a licensed cosmetologist for 11 years and I do my hair at home.I used this like a Thermal Reconstructor and these were my steps.1. Wash hair with clarifying shampoo. Dry and flat iron hair.2. Apply step 1 from box to hair in small sections staying off scalp and keeping hair as straight as possible. Box says 15 min max time and I left mine on for 20 until my curls were relaxed.3. Rinse hair for 6-8 mins (make sure you take your time and rinse everything or your hair will PERMANENTLY smell like a perm) Gently blow dry hair, use a small amount of heat protectant and flat iron again.4. Apply neutralizer and leave it on 10 mins while making sure hair is lying smooth and flat.5. Rinse for 6 mins and apply deep conditioner for 10 mins then rinse.6. Apply heat protectant and leave in conditioner, dry and flat iron.7. You're DONE! Enjoy your beautiful smooth hair and wait 2 days (at least 48 hours) to wash it.I didn't put enough on 1 spot in the nape area and it's wavy instead of curly now but I can wake up, wash and go with straight hair.

It was difficult to find a bed that was 24"" x 36"", so it would nice if the manufacture sold beds that fit their products.

164,"I bought this product feeling confident that it would, if nothing else, smell nice and perhaps make the faded bits of my hair color a little more even. I bought it to *try* to cover or lessen my very white roots. I understand that this product is not meant to cover gray, but based on some of the reviews it seemed like it was worth a shot. I wasn't worried about the mess since I am used to dying my hair with permanent dye.When I first put this product on my hair I was struck by the unpleasant aroma. It is herbal, but in a very medicine-y way. It reminds me of some of those tinctures that chinese herbalists prescribe - they can be very pungent and unpleasant. It kind of grossed me out, but I applied the product liberally to my roots and worked it through the rest of my hair as best I could. (I have long, thick hair that is dyed dark brown.) I left the product on for about 30 minutes since many reviewers said to leave it on longer for darker coverage - it also says this on the bottle. The whole time the smell was nauseating me, but I tried to ignore it. I am shocked that so many people say that it has a pleasant smell.After I rinsed it out, the smell lingered in my hair. I was hoping it would not... shortly after rinsing it out, I actually vomited from the smell. I'm not kidding. Not only that, after it was dry, there was NO DIFFERENCE in my hair color. It did not affect my white roots at all and the rest of my hair looked exactly the same as it had before.Needless to say, I do not recommend this product at all. I am used to dying my hair so I can deal with strong smells, but this stuff was horrible and it did nothing. It doesn't even really condition your hair!!!",Pet_care

Enter the springs. They're great because my cats enjoy chasing them down the hallway (they make a lovely sound on hardwood floors) and when my cats attempt to pick them up or stop them they'll often spring away, leading the cats on another chase. They're one of only a couple toys that my cats will pick up and return to me so less spring chasing for me and more for my cats.",Pet_care

My daughter actually played on Neopets, but I'm the only one who has shown any interest in goign to the Webkins site to see what is was all about. It's cute, but not much fun. You have to earn a lot of points to buy things for your pet, including food. You bascially have to spend more time earning points than playign with your pet.

She usually leaves the dry food sitting until we mix in some wet food, or until she's really hungry. That all changed with this bag, she sits as we pour it and eats the dry food almost immediately. Score one for the brand. Her allergy seems to have gone away, now that could very well mean she has a seasonal allergy, but could indeed also suggest it was food based.

The Gimli is the same mold as the single TWO TOWERS figure, but with orc blood on his armour. Sometimes with box sets that include an 'exclusive' figure, the additional one is somewhat crummy, but the Haldir matches Craig Parker's likeness very well. The only flaw is the paint work.

205,"My nine month old daughter loves this toy. I bought the kitchen because she plays with a larger play kitchen at her sitters all the time. We did not have room for a larger version in our small apartment. Overall it was a good investment as she plays with it frequently. Although she has not discovered the fun of the blocks or the stove yet she does enjoy opening and closing the doors. I wish that Little Tikes would find a way to keep it from turning over so easily though or possibly a way to brace the kitchen to the wall. She has already turn it over on herself several times trying to pull herself up. Other than that we have had none of the issues some of the other reviewers stated. The sound is fine, just loud enough for someone playing with the kitchen to hear, but not so loud that I have to hear it when standing on the other side of the room. We did not have trouble with the phone. Although I have had to go looking for it several times as my daughter tends to crawl off with it.Overall, I would say it was a good investment as she has already spent several hours playing with the kitchen. I hope as she gets older she will learn to enjoy the other activities.",Kids_games
206,"....though I am sorry to say that it has not cured my MinPin's cataracts (diabetes induced).I can say that these OcluVet drops have helped my dog see better because he rarely runs smack into things like he used to---and I don't mean things that are in front of him that he is used to (i.e. knows where they usually are, like chairs or laundry hampers) but things that someone has recently put in his way. (like a new bag of dog food just brought into the house or a bag of garbage that I've taken out of the can but not taken outside yet)Things that are very close to him he still doesn't see well but his distance/peripheral vision is definitely better than it was before I started the drops. (as if the stops have shrunk the diameter of the cataracts and thinned the thickness of them somewhat)Also, the OcluVet drops may have kept the cataracts from getting worse (bigger and thicker), and thereby leaving him totally blind, as I have been very regimented in applying the drops 3x per day ever since I started using them (and this is my 2nd bottle purchased).They are very expensive for the amount you receive, but they do last a good while--over 2 months for a small dog that only needs 1 drop per eye, 3x a day (any more than one drop just squeezes right out, his eyes are so small)I have had no problems with a leaky bottle, as some people have reported---I just make sure the cap is on tightly and shake the bottle side to side rather than up and down. Also, no problems with too many drops coming out when I squeeze the bottle---I first position the dog, holding his eye open, then turn the bottle upside down over his eye, then very slowly and gently squeeze out one drop.I plan to continue using these drops either as long as I can afford them (and with their price and this economy, who knows how long that will be??) or until they don't seem to be working well enough any more to be worth their price.MEDI-VET ANIMAL HEALTH please take note",Pet_care

Nothings better than some frenzied vipers dicing up your friends Mimring in one turn.The Snipers are also fun with a neat ability. When they attack, every successful hit counts double. They only have 1 attack die though, so it's good to get them on high ground (+1 die) and then start shooting.

Anytime any water would hit my hair here would come pouring out this blue water from my scalp and it got everywhere immean what a mess.

I ordered the ""Big-Dog"" because I have a total of 2 small dogs and 2 cats. The dogs were a bit scared of it at first but they warmed up quickly. The cats enjoyed drinking from the stream of water. However, the unit is not constructed well. It is made from cheap plastic and has many parts/angles/crevices, which makes cleaning a pain. The water pump is underneath the unit and after a few days I noticed there was water leaking under the unit (I initially thought it was from the animals drinking or playing with the water). There was a crack where the pump attaches to the unit so water was leaking out. I think having a hole in the bottom of the unit to insert a pump is a major design flaw. Even if it isn't cracked you could risk water leakage if the seal is damaged or has any debris on it when inserted. I think a unit with a solid base and submersible pump would be a safer option. Something dishwasher safe would be even better!On a positive note, aside from the sound of the running water, which can be easily adjusted, the unit runs very quietly. Also, it holds a good amount of water so I did not have to refill it often and because it has a filter I did not need to clean out floating debris (pet hair, etc) daily.",Pet_care

276,"Just got married and had two cats move in. On day 2, one cat races across the leather sofa and his hind claws dig in. Ouch. How long before the sofa is destroyed?The cats have no front claws but we didn't want to take the rear claws out so this seemed like our last hope. The work fabulously and our cats adjusted to them pretty quickly. My wife is great with them so it wasn't a big deal to apply them though it took a few times to dial in the amount of glue to use. Too little and they fall off in a day, too much and you get hair and crud in them that make the cats uncomfortable.They fall off over the next month but as long as you have two on each paw they keep the cats from digging into the sofa or anything else. Trim their nails before you put them on to make sure that they don't grow into the end of the little boots before they fall off.",Pet_care
277,"I own a large bulky Remington hot curler set (which I liked accept for the ""clip-on"" marks left in my hair). I purchased the Conair curler set specifically for travel purposes and I have to say, the Remington set went back into its box and up in the closet. I use the Conair set for everyday use now and I love them. The Remington set left my hair kind of ""fly awayish"" from static or something. The Conair set, while giving great volume and curl, eliminates the static, giving a much healthier look and shine to my hair. And the final advantage, there are no clip marks left from use. I am really pleased with this product.",Pet_care

279,"Versace ""the Dreamer"" -- what can you say? I had moderately high expectations for this fragrance after reading some reviews, and they were not only met but exceeded. Some colognes are classy, fresh, professional, sensual... but seriously, the one word that comes to mind with this smell is SEXY! I mean, I would sleep with myself after smelling this. It is so simple when you look at the notes, yet so well done. Refined, semi-sweet, amazing longevity but does not exaggerate just to draw attention to yourself. I'm trying to come up with a situation where somebody could not wear this -- to no avail. These last few weeks with the temperature being around 90 it will disappear a little too quickly and project a little too much. This is a great fragrance to start your fall collection, or to make a great impression on that first date.It does have some pretty good projection and longevity so I would say to start off with three sprays maximum, and maybe build up from there. The tobacco and floral mixes very well at the beginning, and can actually be quite confusing, which gives the scent a perfect name! With the ""Goddess of Sleep"" as a signature, is hypnotic, but also wait for the dry down after about three hours returns very romantic. Definitely a must try, even a blind buy, but trust your nose and the compliments that you receive.",Perfumes
280,"We've had this attached to our son's crib since birth. He loves the music, but it is a bit loud (I attached foam stickers to the speaker to muffle it to a good level). We apparently had it attached slightly wrong to begin with (slightly angled, not quite vertical) so the mobile didn't move at all (no grinding or indication that it wanted to move, just a stationary mobile), then I accidently knocked it and straightened it (3 months later) and the mobile actually moves to my son's delight! He can listen to the music and watch the mobile for a few pushes of the button (now to teach him where the button to push is..). The moving beads are somewhat loud as well, but they don't seem to bother the little guy and he loves to watch the moving parts.",Kids_games

She mostly loves furry toys with squeakers, but those usually get destroyed within 24-48 hours. The Nylabones are among her favorites, and she's still working on her first one two weeks later. She's even taken it to bed on a few occasions! Definitely a good way to keep your dog occupied for lengthy periods of time. If your dog is much bigger, I'd avoid these smaller sizes, but for dogs under 20lbs, these should be fine.",Pet_care

I didn't even buy it for that reason so it's an amazing perk! The texture of my eye skin has improved greatly. I bought it for the crepey appearance starting to set in and while it's not gone completely, it is improved. The size of the lotion bottle kind of scared me given the cost but you learn to become very careful with the amount. I use about 1/2 a pump per eye.

289,"I found this in the pet store when I was desperately looking for something to clean my mattress... my otherwise good dog decided to pee right smack dab in the middle of my mattress. I was horrified knowing it had seeped deep into the mattress as she was a large dog. I imagined it would smell like dog urine forever and I'd have to replace the mattress. Well - I poured about 2-3 cups of Natures Miracle over the spot on the mattress, letting it seep in just as the urine initially did. I left it to dry a couple of days and to my amazement I could bury my nose in the now dry area and not smell a thing!!! There was no left over stain, nothing. I think there is something to the weather conditions when you use it though. I tried it another time on the rug when it was a humid rainy time and it didn't seem to work as well. Maybe it took too long to dry, I'm not sure. Regardless, I always have some on hand now. It works for feces as well - same dog had intestinal upset with diarrhea on a cream colored carpet. After cleaning up all the removable material, I saturated the area with Nature's Miracle and voila, no one would ever know what happened, especially my nose!",Pet_care

I've been using it for about a week now (along with their thickening conditioner and tonic lotion) and I can see a definite improvement in my hair. Beyond thickening my hair, I have noticed more ""oomph"" and volume in my hair and its also smoother at the ends where my hair is even thinner due to breakage. I do agree that this product is expensive, but its worth it. A little DOES go a long way. I would say I use about half as much of this than I would another shampoo (I can't say that about their conditioner though). If you're lucky enough to have a Bumble & Bumble salon in your area, I'm sure you can find this product for less in store. It smells kind of minty in the bottle, but I think it smells kind of like Pantene Pro V Shampoo once I'm done styling. I would also recommend (and use!) B&B Thickening Spray for even more volume and the B&B color support line - I've had great results with the 'cool blonde' formula.",Hair_products

They would be stuck helplessly inside, and just the thought of that so tears at my heart! And I don't believe in letting them outside, because that is so incredibly dangerous too, much more than keeping them indoors, no matter where you live. At least this way, by putting these bright red stickers on a door and/or window where rescue personnel are likely to see them, telling them you have animal friends inside, what kind and how many, they can at least attempt to save their lives. It at least gives your pets a better chance for survival. And I don't know about you, but that gives me much more peace of mind. Thank you to whoever invented these!",Kids_games

318,"When we adopted a pair of 5-6 lb cats, the first thing I was concerned with was how my fiance would deal with things if he could smell the litter box. He hates cat messes of ANY kind. The first few days we had them I used plastic bags, we all know how those go. Smelly, messy, and if you miss the whole in the bottom of one.....I purchased this at a national pet store chain because I needed to do something fast, and if there were issues I wanted to return it easily and try something else.I have had it for a month now, I am still on the first cartridge that came with it, once a week (or when the wheel gets hard to turn) I open the lid tie off the tube bag, carry it to the trash I am about to take out and seperate the handles. Done. No smell, no litter leaks, and no single plastic bags. I then just pull off enough bag to tie a knot and turn the wheel enough to make sure it's secure.I am using Tidy Cat litter, mainly because it seems to clump on urine the best, and they like to use the same area of the litter box to urinate. With this litter the way it clumps tends to take a lot of litter out at once, (I am ok with this, it allows a nice rate of litter turn over), I turn the wheel enough to seal off the litter clumps, which when it's almost empty is half a turn, and when it's almost full is less than a quarter turn. I don't smell the used litter, and no one else can either.All in all I am very happy with it, and would continue to purchase refills from Amazon.com as they are the cheapest ones available.",Pet_care
319,"I've had this 5-day feeder product for over 3 yrs and it has met my expectations. I've only had to change the batteries once (in May, 2010). The interface and directions were easy to follow in order to set the feeding times. I've set the timer to feed once in the morning while I would get ready for the day, and both morning and night if I'm going to be away from the house. The timer does allow you to pre-set a desired time for feeding your pet, such as more than twice a day. My cat took to it very quickly. The motor of the feeder is loud when it turns, but my cat doesn't mind it. It signals that food is ready! It's made out of durable plastic. He has tried to pry it open, but only left scratch marks near the clasp of the lid. The tray comes out easily for cleaning. I noticed there are no ""indicator"" or ""mark"" to show that the last slot of food would be empty in the next rotation, so I placed a sticker inside a slot to help me remember to fill the tray up with food again. IMHO, I didn't like the overall size of the feeder, but it's not that big of a deal. It's been reliable and I would recommend this to someone who is looking for an automated feeder.As of 06/07/2010, the feeder stopped working. I hope it's not because of the new brand name batteries.

We use 2 pens seperately 1 for each dog. When we go camping we connect the 2 pens together and use the large area for 2 dogs and 2 folding lawn chairs. Yes we sit inside with the dogs. We have it also surrounding the door to our camper so it's very easy to go inside. This time I have also purchased 2 of the quart stainless bowls that clip on to the pen. Our dogs tip over their water sometimes and grass isn't always level in campgrounds. The reason we bought the 1st pen was because one of the dogs had knee surgery and was required to be way less active, no running, no jumping up etc so it was easier being able to use the folding portable pen in the kitchen during the times I was preparing meals.. we used it in the evening to keep him in active in the living room... and used a regular crate at bedtime. When we go away for a few hours we put each dog in a pen in the kitchen. The pen can be made smaller very easily. I highly recommend them for home and travel. Another use is if I wish to sit out in the yard, I put 2 pens together and sit inside the pen with the dogs and read or knit. I have seen many campers use the pens and even leave their pets unattended, the pens do have stakes, but most camp grounds do not allow unattended pets outside. The pen is sturdy. I have also used the pens to go across an opening like the entry to the dining area in a single line zig zag fashion to keep the dogs in the kitchen dining area away from the grandkids running about the rest of the house. We have left one outdoors on our deck numerous times, even getting rained on, and the coating is really good as we've seen no rust, mind you I do try to remember to bring it in.. yes it got snow on it once, but has no ill effects.

346,"Update after 1-1/2 years of use. See added comments at the end.We almost bought the Littermaid Mega Elite at a local pet supply store, but decided to check out the Amazon.com reviews first. A good decision, as usual. Clearly, that model was to be avoided. But, based on most other reviews, the LM900 represented an improvement over previous versions and was worth a try.We have had the LM900 for two weeks now and it is working out quite well, so far. The unit seems well designed and solidly built. As mentioned in other reviews, the rake/motor mechanism appears to be strong. The larger of our two cats is a champion mound builder and during his first use he confirmed his credentials by creating a litter filler pile that was higher than the rake mechanism and scattered considerable material into the rake guide rails. Even before the unit went into action, our initial thought was that the device just wasn't intended for the likes of this cat. But, surprise, the rake plowed through the kitty Matterhorn with no balking at all. It properly scooped up all waste in its path and deposited it neatly into the waste receptacle before returning to its resting position to await the next challenge.Both cats have acclimated well to the unit. The older/larger one never hesitated. The smaller/younger one needed to wait a while to see whether it would devour the older cat. When it became clear that there would be no such luck, even the smaller cat complied with our intentions and everything has been going well since.It may be too early to provide a definitive review regarding longer-term performance and reliability but so far, so good. The LM900 is convenient, saves time and does reduce odors. The only negative comment (as noted by others) is that the waste receptacle/cover is tricky to remove and seal without some minor spillage.Added comments:It's been over 1-1/2 years since placing this item into operation. It's still working very well with 3 cats using it. A real testament as to its sturdy and reliable construction. The litter receptacle bin issue still exists. There is no way you're going to remove it without some spillage, so don't agonize over the effort. It is quite heavy when full. And, as long as you have it out, why not just dump its contents into a plastic bag for disposal and return the empty receptacle back to the unit? The bin doesn't wear out or degrade. This saves having to purchase replacement receptacle bins.Therck",Pet_care
347,"I started wearing Drakkar Noir again after not wearing it for a long time. Now I remember why I started wearing Drakkar Noir in the first place. It is a great all around scent. When you look at your collection of fragrances, this is the one you can wear to work or when you go out. As you pick up the scent from yourself, you may not feel that it smells good but you do get compliments and smiles when you wear Drakkar Noir. Drakkar Noir is a sensual fragrance and works for any occasion. Although this is a spicy fragrance, it is not overpowering and will last throughout the day. You will not be disappointed with Drakkar Noir.",Perfumes
348,"My dogs absolutely love the ORKA puck, which is similar to this, so I wanted to try out a different shape. Maybe they don't chew on it as much as the puck, which must be more appealing in thickness or shape for their jaws and teeth. But they still enjoy chewing it and definitely enjoy tugging on the rope. The rubber material of the stick lasts a really long time. I have a couple of very determined chewers and they make this one last longer than just about any toy I've found. I recommend it, but try out the other shapes as well.",Pet_care
349,"I have used a lot of dog shedding brushes--teflon combs, shedding blades, and a cheaper version of this--and, as good as some of them are on my dog's coat, none of them work anything like the Furminator. The owner of the self-service dog wash let me borrow his one day, and I was hooked. I can brush my corgi once a week or so and pull out more hair than I thought possible. His coat looks much better, as does my house. It's very expensive (my only reason for the 4-star rating rather than 5), but for me, it was definitely worth it.",Pet_care

354,"*****This has been my daily moisturizer for several years. It makes my skin very soft, very healthy looking, and glowing. It makes me look radiant. I have given it as a gift to my sister and to other women, and they have all liked it as much as I have. No one has had any adverse reactions. You can notice a difference after just one use. When I've run out and used something else temporarily, I always can see the difference again once I start back up. It is as close as it gets to a miracle cream.I do not wear makeup, so Hope In A Jar is it. I am 49 years old and I think my skin looks incredible. The friends I have given it to also like to keep a natural look and prefer their skin without heavy creams, thick moisturizers and sunscreens, or makeup.The women I know who are fans of Hope In A Jar are like me. We're kind of lazy no-fuss ""one cream that does it all"" people; instead of one jar of something for one thing, and another for something else---eye creams, night time moisturizers, daytime moisturizers, etc.---we're the type that wants just one that can do the job and then be done with it. In other words, we don't have the patience to fuss with our looks a lot, or to spend money buying bunches of different creams to keep track of and remember to use.Unlike other reviewers, I love the smell, which is not perfumey, but definitely pleasantly distinctive. I use it around my eyes also, and have not had an allergic reaction. It seems, though, that these are the two biggest problems with Hope---the distinctive odor and allergic reactions among some people. I would suggest buying it the first time from somewhere you could return it if you don't care for it; although in my opinion, this would be unlikely, apparently it is possible. Philosophy now makes another version of Hope In A Jar for sensitive skin; if you know that your skin in tempermental, perhaps it would be better to also try this version. I have stuck with Hope In A Jar because it works so well for me.It seems expensive, but it is not because it lasts a long, long time. The two-ounce jar lasts me about six months. I use a toner and then Hope In A Jar and that's it. I'm done with my face in 30 seconds. Plus, it gives me a look that most women use makeup to get, so I think it's a bargain.****",Hair_products

356,"Unit arrived with the cord cut in half. Disappointed, but didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it, so spliced the cord back together. Kitties love it. One of my kitties loved to tip her water bowl over, so this way she can play all she wants but can't knock it over.I break it down and wash it every week, it gets slimy otherwise. It is nice that it can be washed thoroughly. Have put the base and tower in the top of the dishwasher and they clean up fine. Definitely worth the money.",Pet_care
357,I bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts and was very disappointed. When you play the game you feel like you should be quiet for the 30 seconds the other players use to study the card. It's like taking a test in front of your friends and family. It's excrutiatingly BORING.,Kids_games
358,"Seriously - Stop wasting your time on BS products. If you've landed on this page, you are fortunate. This product outperforms every single product and DOCTOR I have talked to about my skin. I didn't develop acne until the ripe age of 26. YES, 26!!!! WTH, right?? At least I only had to deal with one awkward phase of life at a time, not all at the age of 16 -- so anyways, I tried everything until I noticed my sister's skin had cleared entirely after using this product. She doesn't even need to wear face make up anymore. Yes, it cleared up that much. I decided to give it a whirl ... I mean why not, I had already spent so much money on other products, what's another 25 bucks right? Hands down, the best $25 dollars I ever spent. I got my glow back, my self esteem, my energy... all for less than an hour's work. I couldn't be more happy with my skin, it's even better now than it was before I started breaking out. I barely wear any face make up, just some powder and blush and it looks so smooth.The only qualm I have is the process. You have to be dedicated and go in with the mindset that this is a 3 stop process and it does take time. It's not just washing your face and slick on some moisturizer. It is really CLEANING your face with the face wash, using the toner. Letting that dry entirely and then either putting on the moisturizer in the morning, or the overnight cream at night. This should be put on very generously. I've noticed the more I put on, the clearer my skin is in the morning. This also has to dry before hitting the pillow to avoid a mess.Also, as another reviewer wrote, this is not for you if you have the rare breakout. The medicines are potent and it will dry out your skin the first week you use it. Keep lip balm handy as it dries out your lips too. This only lasts about the first week or two though and after that you'll be glad you stuck to it. Also, keep out of your eyes -- don't even get close because it will irritate your undereyes as well. I speak from experience :/",Pet_care

361,"We bought this for my son who is 4 and never had a remote truck before. We weren't sure if he would be too old for this one, but we were wrong. Its perfect for his age! Easy to control and very durable. Even my 1 year likes to push buttons and drag it around. It seems to hold up to the banging around. Batteries die quickly it only uses 'AA"" but works out in the dirt too.",Kids_games
362,"I've been giving this product to my dog for about 1 month now along with the recommended other supplement Arthisoothe. I have to say, I really don't see any improvement in him. He is a 3 year old Collie that had an injury at 15 months that has caused him some early problems with arthritis. I was hoping he would do better on this stuff, but so far, he is not. Since I bought a big bottle of it, I will continue with it until they are gone just to see if there is improvement after some more time has gone by.",Pet_care
363,"I never write reviews, but holy cow did this product work on my cat. So the product is really just some wire wound around some cardboard ends. But the wire is just the right thickness and the cardboard draws just enough attention that my normally lazy adult cat (who never plays with toys) was completely entranced by it - even more so than with a laser pointer because this toy she could occasionally grab and swipe at. Again, this isn't anything fancy. But the wire makes the end move erratically so just a little bit of movement with your hand can cause very random movements at the end (think moth fluttering crazily about). Very minimal effort on your part, and a very happy kitty. Excellent product.",Pet_care

So we just help them along withthis rule...giving each child a chance to win a tile...Also I would recommend that an adult or older responsibleperson help with this game...the tiles are a bit hardto put back and if little ones are trying by themselvesthey won't have success with this part of the game andif they are rough on things they could break it...SOHAVE AN OLDER RESPONSIBLE PERSON HELP.Overall, I think it is great and I am glad I purchased this forthem!",Kids_games

376,"I have afro kinky African-American hair. I assure you that this is THE single best oil I've ever tried. I don't know what it is about it but it is completely different than any other oil out there. I have regular problems with dry frazzled hair. Most times I wind up with dry crispy hair with fruity smelling oil dripping down coating my neck and forhead. Yick. Somebody told me about Botanic oil so I went to check it out. Due to the pricey tag, I cheated and sampled some in the store while no one was looking. Right away my hair was softer on contact with just a little drop. I bought it immediately. NO oil can do what this one does. With my worst hair I mix it in with my favorite conditioner, heat the mixture in the microwave for a few seconds and then apply to my hair under a plastic cap. My hair is as soft as a whisper after.Best about this oil, you can use it all over. Good for skin and nails too and it has no fragrance at all. It won't clash with any other product/fragrance you love and it is completly safe for sensitive skin and noses. It might be tricky trying to find this product soon. They are going to change the label and begin selling Botanic Oil under their AloXXi line, and you will only be able to buy it in bulk 33.8 fl. oz. sizes. Because everything I ever loved has gotten discontinued I'm going to buy two of these but unless you plan on drinking it, it should last you a long time.I hear ApHogee makes an Essential Fatty Acids oil that gives this one a run for it's money at a much friendlier price but I've never tried it personally. Good luck finding either of them though. They are hard to track down.",Pet_care

382,"We have another toy by this company (Multipet) that our girl dog loves and is the only plush toy they haven't destroyed within 15 minutes. So I wanted another one for the boy dog. I ordered this one because of its large size and because it has very few ""pieces"" that could be ripped off. The dog loves it and it's lasted over a month, even though it's pretty disgusting from the slobber. He's finally ripped a hole in it, but I just removed the stuffing and he still plays with it. I've tried toys by other brands, but our dogs only seem to enjoy the ones from Multipet and they tend to last the longest.",Pet_care
383,"I bought my husband, an avid chess player, Excaliber for Christmas. Overall it has been more than challenging for him on even the lowest settings. There are a few glitches off and on probably because of the sensitivity of the machine, and he has had to restart it more than once. It sometimes reads error although the space it is called on has not been in play or has no chess piece for awhile. My husband does not have good eyesight and we find the digital display quite small for older folks. There are several ways according to the enclosed pamphlet to reset, takeback moves, etc but once it says error it usually pretty much sticks to it until you restart the game. We would much prefer lit LED squares to show the moves rather than the grid method, but he still enjoys his Excaliber because of the challenge and regulation size.",Kids_games

I was pleased with how cheap it is. That helped me overlook the fact that it was a workout to get the clumps out. But after a year of use, I could no longer overlook the extremely fine white dust that was accumulating on my peanut butter jars on top of the refrigerator. I am now using World's Best, which is more expensive, but worrth it. Buy it from Amazon or PetfoodDirect.",Pet_care

387,"At first I thought this litter box was great, but then I realized it wasn't all that great when I had to take it apart and clean the whole thing. My cat sprays on the inside of the box and the rolling action of the self cleaning feature created a coat of clumping litter on the inside of the box as well as odor. So while I thought I was getting off easy with the cleaning- I actually was creating a HUGE cleaning headache for myself...the grill inside was a nightmare to clean! (Even if your cat does not spray remember not to roll the box until after the clumping litter has hardened otherwise you will get sticky litter stuck to the grill.) I went back to a regular litterbox,litter made from wheat and daily litterbox patrol. I'd say I don't do anymore work now than I did when I used this self cleaning litter box. When looking at reviews for this product make sure it is from someone who has used it for at least a month- because I know the first few weeks you'll think you found a gold mine and then you realize cleaning a litterbox still requires work!",Pet_care

393,"I usually go into these reviews with at least a partial sense that I am subject to committing user error. In this case, I can't lay fault completely to the product, but I will say that the biggest problems were not caused by me.First, the product does not anywhere say that someone with light skin couldn't not use it. As it is the medium and not the dark, I thought I was safe. Wrong.Next, it doesn't have any suggestions for HOW to apply the color. That would be helpful. I read around that I should use circular motions, and when I got to it, I forgot and didn't at all. That was definitely my fault. Straight up and down motions cause streaks.

Granted, this is not a burrowing mange mite like the sarcopic mange the bottle targets, but it was still not reacting to anything else I tried. I was at a point where I would try anything to make him feel better.This stuff smells horrible (your dog and probably your house will smell like turpentine after use) but after dousing my Corgi with it and leaving it in a couple days before bathing him, he is itch-free!. Also be wary of where your dog sleeps etc. while the treatment is on him/her. I have a nice oily yellowish spot on my comforter. The treatment is an nasty orange color, but since my dog is orange, I can't really say if it would stain a light colored dog.

413,"Purchased Leapster and case for Christmas 2005. Zipper broke last night (not even 3 months later). We have always been careful with the Leapster and case so it's not being tossed around. I saw one review that indicated it's a problem if you have a cartridge inserted when placing in the case. Maybe that's the problem but it didn't seem like that would matter. Case needs to be a tad bit bigger so there is not so much stress on the case. I'm going to give another one a try hoping it will be better.

When we got it, he used it once and I saw a dramatic diffrence. It wasn't all gone, but instead of the huge flakes, there were only little flakes.

433,"My wife and I have owned the Cat Genie for about 4 weeks now and love it. When I first read about it, I thought it was a joke and couldn't stop laughing at the cat toilet that someone had 'invented', but the thing really works well. We have 2 cats (sisters, 9 months old) and they seem to do very well with it. One of the cats started using it immediately and preferred it over the old litter box. The other took about a week to train (suggested time frame from the company). In the training process there were a couple of accidents, but they were all in our laundry room. Ironically, one of the accidents was on the instruction manual for the Cat Genie! After this initial phase-in of 1-1.5 weeks, we haven't had any problems. We set the device to clean itself 2 times per day when our cats are inactive (4am and 4pm) and that works well. We have it hooked up to our laundry drain pipe for waste disposal and that works well (no clogs so far, although I have heard that others have problems if the waste isn't removed often enough, i.e. less than once per day)We both love the device and think that it is worth the price that is being charged and the fact that we don't have to scoop and dispose of normal cat litter. We had been thinking about getting one of the other 'automatic' litter boxes, but you still have to empty these devices on a weekly basis and I've heard that they don't work well.As with any consumer product there are faults, but I feel the gains much out way the faults.Pros:-The first fully automatic litter box!-only $ 330 (not much for what it does)-relatively reliable (could take vacation without too much worry for litter box, although I would want someone to check-in once or twice)-The box is always clean for the cats (they seem to prefer this now that they are used to it)-The plastic litter pellets are clean and are easy to sweep upCons:-somewhat loud (not as loud as a washing machine though)-litter pieces tend to scatter out (we are buying a special hood that just came out)-smell of cleaning solution is strong (it is a pleasant smell, but it smells like cleaning solution in a large part of the house for an hour after a cleaning cycle)-$330. Thats a lot of money for anything, but especially on a litter box-somewhat large (the bowl is larger than a standard toilet bowl, but is about the same size as our previous litter box, so it makes sense I guess)Also, some people complain about the cost of the consumables (litter pellets, and cleaning solution), but I think I agree with the company in that the consumables cost about the same price as the normal litter, if not a bit cheaper.Improvements I would like to see for V2.0:-more flexible cleaning times (for 2 times per day it cleans 12 hrs apart, 3 cycles is 8 hrs apart, and so on). I would like it to clean at 4am and at 1pm but this isn't possible now.-It would be nice if it came with a hood, but that is an add-on now-deeper litter depth (right now it can only allow for 3-4cm of litter depth and its seems like our cats would like to bury their waste a little deeper-quieter cleaning cycles (but a more flexible cleaning time cycle would make this point moot if we were gone for the day or asleep)-smaller total size, although the litter bowl size is about perfectSo, if you have the initial $330 for a litter box and want it to be automatic, then this thin is awesome and I highly recommend it. However, if your mission is to save money, then it doesn't make sense as a purchase.Hope this was helpful!",Pet_care
434,I read the reviews before I bought this game for my 2 year old. Keeps my two year old totally engaged and it is fun to play with her.

439,"I own this product and have used it 3 times so far. I hate coloring my hair but refuse to pay to have my hair colored at the salon. This Colorjoi is the only product on the market (AFAIK) that helps with home hair coloring.This product is not complicated to use. Just load the chamber with your mixed hair color then press the button to advance the hair color out of the prongs. Brush your hair with the device (like using a bulky hair brush) while holding the button down and the hair color is distributed to the root and along the length of your hair.The Colorjoi works quite well and is much easier than sectioning hair into tiny lines and squeezing hair color along each part then combing through. I would recommend doing the back of the head separately first (the instructions only say to do that for long hair, but I think it would work best for all lengths), to make sure that the hair underneath is completely covered with hair color. I have shoulder-length hair and section the back into two sections (top of back and bottom of back) then section the front/top into right and left sides. When using the Colorjoi, I am careful to cover all areas of my head and I use a comb after putting on the color to better distribute to the ends of my hair.The Colorjoi comes with two types of color diffusers, one for overall coloring and one for root coloring. I have only used the overall coloring one.It holds one standard size box of haircolor and needs to be re-loaded if you use additional hair color (i usually use 1 1/2 boxes). It is not difficult to re-load, though - just unscrew the color diffuser, press down on the bottom and add more hair color.It is somewhat difficult to clean, although the hair color chamber does easily remove from the base/handle. Even though it says to throw out the color diffuser (what the previous review was complaining about), I just wash it and reuse. It is made of heavy plastic, too heavy to seem ""disposable"". I put the diffuser directly under the faucet to wash out the prongs and tap it on the bottom of the sink to get the haircolor out. Just hold up to a light to see if the prongs are clean.I did not find the written instructions long or confusing. It also comes with DVD instructions to watch a video on how it is used.I do like this appliance. It makes haircoloring so much easier for me. I used to have a very hard time coloring my hair by myself, especially the back of my head. The Colorjoi makes it much easier and I would recommend it. It is not a holy grail product, but it is a good value when compared to salon coloring and also saves time.",Pet_care
440,"I ordered this because at 40 I started to get dark circles under my eyes. They are not puffy, but rather more gaunt looking. Looked like I was closer to 50, especially when tired.I ordered this and RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream at the same time. I got the Neutrogena because it had positive reviews and was inexpensive; I got the RoC because it was a brand that I heard a lot of people recommend for dark circles under the eye.I put the Neutrogena on at night and the next morning when I woke up I had forgotten about getting these products - first time I've bought anything other than Irish Spring and toothpaste. When I looked in the mirror I immediately noticed a difference - I checked to see how long I had slept because I figured it was due to a good nights sleep. Nope, 1 hour less than normal.That doesn't mean they were completely gone, just noticeably lighter. I used the Neutrogena for 2 more days until I read the directions. There's a warning that it makes you more sensitive to sunlight. I live in TX and burn walking across a parking lot so I decided to put this away for when it's cloudy & switched to the RoC. I put it on at night and in the morning and it seems to keep making improvements...enough that I don't regret the purchase.",Pet_care
441,"We purchased this red fire engine for our 2 1/2 year old son who loves vehicles. It's the fourth Playmobil vehicle we have purchased for him. At first he wouldn't touch the candy in his Easter basket (""I driving fire truck!"")The firefighter is one piece, hinged in the middle so he can either sit or stand. His head rotates 180*. He is the same size as the mature Playmobil figures, so the toddler collection can still be used as he grows into the Playmobil sets with little pieces. Technically, the firefighter could fit through a toilet paper tube. The packaging says this is intended for ages 18 months and older. The ladder can tilt up or level; it can also swivel 180*. The little sign can be put away on the truck under the ladder. My only disappointment with this vehicle is that the ladder has come off the truck a few times. It is easy to snap back on.

460,"I thought our cat would take to this NO PROBLEM. Boy, was I wrong! I first wanted to purchase CitiKitty before we even had a cat. We used to have a cat before we moved, and the reason we didn't get another right away is because we simply didn't like the cat litter. No matter how many times it was changed, and how many different brands we tried, our house always smelled! So, when I saw CitiKitty on Shark Tank, I instantly became so excited! No more stinky house!Almost a year later, we finally picked up our kitty. I sound like one of those crazy moms, but he's really smart! He picks things up quickly. We could put the kitty litter anywhere, and he always found it on his own--even when we took him on vacation with us for a couple of weeks. He wasn't afraid of the toilet at all--and even tried to drink from it over the water in his bowl. We thought we were finally ready to use CitiKitty, and purchased the system, along with the flushable litter. He was perfectly fine with it on the toliet with the the rings intact. In fact, as I was setting it up, he kept putting his nose there to see what was going on, and used it within 5 minutes. After a couple of weeks, and no problems at all with accidents, we took out the first ring. That's where the trouble began...he started doing all his business on the floor by the toilet. We gave it another couple weeks to see if he would snap out of it. Well, there was improvement--he started peeing with the CitiKitty, but still pooping on the floor. With both my husband and I working full-time, it was quite a mess to clean when we came home.We finally put the insert back in so it didn't have any holes. Again, he used that perfectly fine. No problems! As soon as we took it out again (when I had spring break and had a lot of time off), he started pooping on the floor. The system came with helpful hints, and those haven't seemed to work out too well. Since he preferred to go around the sides and back of the toilet, we tried to block that area off and even sprayed kitty-off there so he wouldn't be tempted to poop. Sure enough, ten minutes later, there was a fresh pile waiting in the ""no go"" zone. We haven't given up yet, though. We are going to continue to try!",Pet_care

Even the backpacks are copies and the body molds appear to be retreads as well. However, the head sculpts are new and the helmets, as best as I can tell, are new. One major knock",Kids_games
476,"My son has been wanting this playset since he got his first figure and saw the videos. I must say I was as excited to play with it as he was. I was a bit disappointed that the figures don't say more things when hooked up to the back pack. I thought they would say other phrases than what they normally say with their own backpack. It was also sort of a pain to put together. You had to align the tabs just so or it wouldn't pop together. Seems to me, that is a problem with most Fisher Price toys you have to assemble. It always seems like the plastic is cheap and flimsy. Once I assembled this toy though, it did seem sturdy enough.Also,there were about thirty stickers I had to apply myself. My son is three and very happy with the toy and plays with it constantly. We did have to rearrange his room a bit to accommodate it.",Kids_games
477,"My daughter got this toy before she could crawl. She liked the colored lights and to watch us make it play music. Eventually she learned to turn it on by kicking her feet. Later she banged on it and was fascinated when she could make it play. Now she has mastered it and likes to push it around the floor. You are going to be disappointed if you are expecting your child to learn anything about music from this toy, but it has been great to watch how her play with this toy progressed as our baby's motor and cognitive skills develop.It's been very sturdy. At first it made some weird sounds, but that went away. The music is OK, but we didn't get the toy for our enjoyment. It's fine for baby. The only negative -we had the same trouble other reviews have mentioned with getting that crazy wire out of the toy. It took lots of tugging with pliers!",Kids_games

479,"I was a little worried about the durability of the ball, especially with my golden retriever/chow mix (who's jaws can crack through bone like tissue paper), but was extremely pleased that, after several days of determined chewing, all she could do was scratch the surface of the outer ball. The inner ball rattles around when the ball is rolled, which definitely drives my dogs nuts, and really does keep them entertained with the ball longer than with other toys.The only reason I wouldn't give this toy 5 stars is because of the central ball. While the outer shell is make of thick, rigid plastic, the central ball is made of very thin plastic and is filled with air. Unfortunately, within days of getting the ball, my border collie figured out she could step on the inner ball through one of the openings, deflate the ball, and the ball will fall right out. Naturally, she then chewed the ball to pieces in a fit of triumph, which rendered the toy useless.However, it was easy to grab another ball from around the house (a squeaker ball, actually) which was made of a much more durable and rigid plastic, that was malleable just enough to squeeze into the shell and effectively make our own version of the toy (which squeaks).So, overall the toy is great for hardy chewers, but not so great for dogs who are a little too smart for their own good.",Pet_care
480,"I bought this for my husband who works with his hands and comes home quite grimy. Of course all of that grime sticks under his fingernails and leaves his hands most unsightly. He previously had a wooden spa-type nail brush and that worked ok but the wood eventually split and became mildewy after many months exposed to water. This one works great for him. He commented at how the single row of bristles worked better under his nails than the wooden, boars hair brush had. His hands look better too. We would definitely recommend this brush.

I'm hoping to give this another run because for the money that I paid for it I really had high hopes especially after reading all of the great reviews. It looked promising but I'm really disappointed. Maybe it is because it's so flimsy. It's very thin and seems very cheaply made. It really resembles a punch out card template.

Other treat dispenser toys, including the standard Kong, are too easy for her. Enter, the Buster Cube. I was recommended this toy from a local trainer who has had great luck with it. For my dog, this is not a very difficult toy to figure out, although compared to other toys she has had, this has taken considerably longer for her to master. About 2 days in, she's able to flip the cube on soft carpet and turn it successfully until all of the food we put inside of it is gone.We enjoy feeding her meals with the cube, as it helps stimulate her mind, keeps her occupied, and feeds her all at the same time. This is also one of the first toys that she can't just pick up, chew, crack, shred, or decapitate. I love this and have suggested it to several other pet owners.",Pet_care

Even at the beginning, it doesn't have much power, which is a positive quality if you're going for subtlety.If you're looking for a cologne with a punch, go for something with more musk and more staying power.

However, my experience with this product is just so amazing that I felt compelled to write about it.First off, I live in St. Louis, where there is a hogepodge of various types of grass. When I first opened this product, I thought, how is this mini rake going to pick up the 'stuff'? Particularly in zoisa and kentucky blue grass areas. Well folks, I tell ya, it does. And it does it so well that I actually look forward to keeping the lawn clean. One quick scoop is all it takes. I'm 5'11"" and have had no issue with bending down because of the handle length. I merely stand right next to it and voila, it's in the scoop. I put the remains in the compost pile and I'm done.

I wanted to take care of both additions to my hair and was recommended by my colorist to purchase Redken. Her salon offered the product but being a wise buyer I declined her offer to purchase from her and went to the Amazon website and took care of business. I'm still using the product and it's been a while but the bottles are very big and should last a while. The promise to keep your color lasting longer has been kept and I love the way my hair is easy to comb after shampooing and condtitiong. I find that I only need a very small amount of condtioner and only need to leave it on for just a few seconds; well around 30 seconds then rinse. I have fine hair and leaving on longer would take out some of the body. I think this shampoo would be great for any hair to be honest. I remember one time on Oprah that they were saying that the shampoo isn't a big deal that most of them are alike and put your money into the conditioner. Well for me I think both are important and I would invest in a shampoo that doesn's strip your color or perm out of your hair. I would recommend this product to anyone and will be buying again.

554,I bought this for mobile for my baby boy about a year ago. He did not seem to be very interested at first but now he enjoys looking at it.

555,"I have very sensitive, very oily skin. My skin reacts to most products, I cannot use many eye creams/makeups because they will irritate my eyes. I break out very easily using most products. The majority of moisturizers are out, even oil-free.Enter Jojoba Oil. Hello, skin-saver.My many uses:1. Makeup remover/Face Wash - Better than any traditional makeup remover, and you only need a few drops.2. Moisturizer - Remember folks, I have oily skin. Jojoba oil amazingly reduces oil over-production, and keeps skin soft and smooth without breaking me out, or drying me out from using harsh facewash.3. Eye cream - At night, I slather it on.4. Scalp/Hair Treatment - Every week I massage my scalp, and let it sit overnight. Shampoo is very harsh on hair.5. Dry/Cracked Feet/Legs - A few drops on their own or mixed in with moisturizer works wonders.Why Jojoba Oil is different? The Jojoba Tree Extract is actually a wax ester (not an oil). This ester is more similar to the human skin's natural oil than any other fruit or plant based oil extract.",Hair_products

You can make the crate smaller for a young puppy to discourage eliminating in the cage and yet you don't need to buy a new crate when he is full grown. You just take the divider out. It is a very sturdy pen for the money, yet portable because it folds flat. I know I sound like an ad but I am just saying that all the things the company says about it are true.",Pet_care

570,"Though this is technically a ""board game"", there isn't really a board beyond the scoring track. Instead, it's more like a puzzle where each side matches every other side but the pictures might not flow together seamlessly. I won't get into a summary of the rules since I'm sure other reviewers have covered that.Carcassonne has fairly simple gameplay that results in complicated games with many turns and a variety of strategies (i.e. Go for lots of short roads and two tile cities, build big and risk not finishing things, or devote followers early to farming to reap rewards later in the game)My personal recommendation for learning the game or introducing new players to it is to ignore farming the first time through until everyone is comfortable with the core road / city rules, has seen all the tiles, and understands the scoring system.Some flaws with Carcassonne",Kids_games

574,"My hairstylist recommended this hair dryer--it is the one she uses on my hair at the salon. My hair always looks better after she styles it--and I use the same shampoo and brush that she does--that meant it was time to invest in the dryer. The dryer is pretty quiet and light. Seems like it is made well enough--must be since my stylist has been using it everyday (multiple times) for more than 3 years. I looked at upgrading since there are newer CHI's out there--but this one was cheaper and I knew for sure that it would do a good job. I don't regret not getting one of their fancier more powerful models--I'm not trying to fry my hair, just dry and shape it. After my other professional hairdryer died (did a good job--but got crushed in an accident), I began using a $20 cheapie--what a mistake. When people tell you that all hairdryers are the same, it is because they don't really know. My research has indicated that CHI is only brand on the market with full ceramic components--not just ceramic coated. I really didn't want to spend all this money--but my hair actually looks much better and others have noticed. I would recommend this dryer--it was worth the price to me.",Pet_care
575,"We received two of these as gifts, the Peapod and the Snuggle Bug for my 1.5 year old twin boys. We went to the regular toy store looking for a doll they could play with and pretend to care for (our babysitter just had a baby and we thought this would be good for them.) but found a bunch of cheap, plastic, wet-yourself, crying and SUPER PINK dolls, not one that would be at all desirable for future daddies. We found these in a specialty toy store and love them. My boys cuddle them and pretend to feed them from their zippy cups, they even bring them to me and tell me the baby is stinky and we change its diaper using one of their newborn cloth diapers. They think this is hysterical. I love this baby, it's soft and cute, and perfect for 1-year-olds. It is great for a girl or a boy, the girl doll is pink but not obnoxiously so, the boy is a nice blue. I highly recommend these for your little one, they are a nice, soft first baby.",Kids_games
576,"With Christmas advancing upon us like impending doom, once again we jettison all those pesky thoughts of recycling, carbon footprints and being sensible with money out of our minds and begin the annual, increasingly grim farce that is Christmas. Yes, you too can line up in supermarkets with more food than you could hope to eat in a month (all for one day) whilst listening to ""Feed the World"". You too can continue the pointless, hollow sham of sending Christmas cards to everyone you know for no reason at all. And yes, you too can continue the obscene tradition of spending more and more money on gifts, cursing yourself for giving into the hype - yet again - safe in the knowledge that you'll be dancing to the same tune like a tinseled up automaton in 12 months time.So with that in mind, The Curmudgeon brings you all a seasonal warning; if you're buying gifts for kids, BE CAREFUL what you buy. In this day and age of information at our fingertips, there really is no excuse for buying bad toys. A quick Google search will give you all the advice on what to buy, as well as ""reviews"" from the usual idiots on Amazon who seem to think their opinions actually count for something, (your humble narrator obviously excluded). But you just know some non-clued up granny or well meaning but dumb mother is going to shell out hard earned money to earn their child's love, only to see little Timmy's excited, hopeful face fall as they rip open that carefully wrapped parcel and discover what is, essentially, a steaming festive turd.We're talking jigsaw puzzles of animals. We're talking those creepy Marvel figures with the dopey smiling faces and glassy eyes. We're talking bargain bin merchandise of movies no-one liked (The Mummy 3 action figures, anyone?) And yes, we're talking this atrocity - the Transformers version of Boba Fett.It's quite a perverse skill, I suppose; take two undoubtedly very cool things - Boba Fett and Transformers - and combine the two to make something so wretched it deserves to be placed on top of every crackling yuletide log under the fireplace. An obvious example of ""well, kids like Star Wars. And kids like Transformers. Isn't there a way we can combine the two?"" Answer being - no. No you can't. Because, unlike adults, kids aren't stupid about this sort of thing. No kid in it's right mind is going to accept the fact that BOBA FETT TRANSFORMS INTO HIS SPACE SHIP.Believe it or not, kids don't just take thing with wheels and run them up the furniture making ""brrrrm"" noises. They create stories based on what they know and have seen on TV. And how the hell does a kid fathom out Boba Fett turning into his damn ship?? I'm not saying kids are all ""that's not considered canon"" nerds (that comes later) but give them some credit.Taking two famous brands and forcing them together could, I suppose, work. If done well. With a little care and attention to detail, the merging of two vastly different entities could perhaps bring something new and exciting for kids to play with.But LOOK at the picture of Boba Fett here. Seriously, look at it. Is Boba pregnant? Is he wearing a tracksuit? Does he have Jabba's lunch stuffed up his jacket? And why does he have a hunchback? One of the most iconic, cool characters in the entire Star Wars universe suddenly morphed into a spindly-armed blue and grey Sumo wrestler. Gee.. thanks Hasbro.Someone, somewhere, is buying this awful toy, and some kid, somewhere, is pretending to like it. Don't let it be you.",Kids_games

The area where you insert the bags is basically a twist open and you drop the bag roll in, very easy to refill. I also love the fact that the bags are biodegradable, environmentally friendly is always good. With a 120 count bag refill being listed on amazon for $10 - I will be getting refills and continue to use this scoop. I would recommend this to any cat owner.",Pet_care

588,"Hi. I have used Frontline plus for years. This weekend. I had rescued a small breed puppy that was so flea infested that I get queasy thinking about it.I went to the vets and had her checked out and they told me it was safe to put Frontline plus for dogs under 22 pounds.I did. And, 48 hours later a big difference.I think people forget that fleas will still pop up on the dog but they don't last. It take 24 hours for the fleas to die. Also it acts like flea birth control that helps cut down on a flea infestation.Also, my vet reminded me, it is important to remember no bath 2 days prior to applying Frontline and 2 days after to bath time. Also if you don't use a mild doggie shampoo the product will not last as long. A more harsher not made for dogs shampoo will strip the product off the dog.I hate putting chemicals on my dogs and I know one of my dog reacts every time I put it on but she hasn't had any sort of visible skin reaction. So, I continue to use this product. It is important to remember it only works for 30 days. I always put it on the first garbage day of the month. :)I highly recommend this product.",Pet_care

593,"My family and I are avid Scrabble players and looked forward to trying the new Super Scrabbble edition. We were, however, sorely disappointed. The only thing ""super"" about it is that it is super-long. While it was a great idea to add more letters, higher points per word and a larger board, the end product seemed an inferior edition, hastily manufactured and largely untested.The manufacturer simply added a border to the existing Scrabble game board. The new higher point squares are all near the periphery so it takes some game time to be able to use them. The board itself is flimsy and too large to comfortably swivel as each player takes their turn. It would be better to have it on a turning pedestal similar to the Deluxe edition. There are many more tiles on this board. It would have been nice to have the tile pockets on the board to hold them all in place - again like the Deluxe edition.The score pad is too short for the length of this game and the increased number of tiles should be in a larger bag as the same size bag makes it harder to pass and mix. We tried giving each player nine, instead of the standard seven, tiles but the tile holder is too short for this to be comfortable.In short, we do not recommend this new version. It compares unfavorably to the Deluxe Scrabble edition.",Kids_games

I went with Olivella because the bottle said 100% Virgin Olive Oil. I have been using it for the past week, and imagine my surprise when I glanced at the ingredients list to see what they had used to scent the oil (because it doesn't smell like olive oil) and found, among other things, retinyl palmitate! Not exactly 100% virgin olive oil!

I did take pause when I read a number of reviews that complained about compatability issues and such, but I figured that there was always some idiot out there who didn't follow the directions! So when amazon ran a special on the system, I grabbed one. Then I spent 30 minutes trying to make the darn thing work! I read the directions, looked up the code for my dvd unit and proceeding with the setup, which seemed quite elementary. Elementary that is until the code didn't work. Never worry, Fisher Price listed a solution to this problem; unfortunately that didn't work either, and Fisher Price has the nerve to let their employees have Saturday off - so no help from customer service! Next I tried our second dvd player, and the code took the first time, but the test card would not work. The player kept reading different screens from the ones that I placed in it, and I grew increasing frustrated. Eventually I got through the setup process. I tried the included disc to see if my soon to be three year old son would enjoy it. He has only recently started to show an interest in watching tv, loves pushing buttons (what toddler doesn't!), and I thought this would be a great game for him to play that let him see shows while interacting with them, not just sitting there like a couch potato. Well, it starts out like a tv episode, then the screen freezes (which would probably set my son off), and a picture of the controller appears with the main character asking a question for the child to answer with the controller. On the episode that I played, Elmo was very hard to understand. When I answered incorrectly, I was startled that Elmo said something to the effect of ""NO - that's not what Elmo was thinking about"", in a somewhat abrupt tone. When I tried to answer differently, I had to wait for Elmo to finish with his speech before it would even recognize my answer. So the kid could answer correctly, but never know it because Elmo is still telling him that he is wrong from before. I was incrediably disappointed by the slowness of the unit, and its lack of responsiveness. I rried one more question and gave up before I died from boredom. This toy would not pass muster with my son, and would likely be thrown in record time. I repackaged the thing (no small task mind you), and took it back to the store (amazon was sold out when I placed my order), where the customer service lady was not at all surprised to have it returned. Don't waste your money or time on this disappointment from Fisher Price.",Kids_games

So originally I was going to get this for my son, but I have now absconded with it and it has become a great tool for me to use. If your child has GREAT handwriting or is college bound with a need to take notes on the fly this thing is awesome. If your child doesn't print well, or is not acadamia bound, maybe you want to invest in something different. Overall I loved the first incarnation of the fly pen (which my kids still use!) and I really like the features on this pen too.

632,"I cannot recommend this product enough!My daughter has had this system for about two years now. She has several cartridges and still plays with it frequently. It is our favorite toy for long car rides, because...* You can use HEADPHONES with it! (All the Moms say, ""Yes!"") BTW, this is true for all the LeapFrog products I have found so far!* It doesn't have a bunch of loose parts (the pen is well-attached, and extra cartidges can be kept in the carrying case, if you get one -- which I recommend).* They can play with it for hours and not mind that they're learning things!* Far better than an X-Box or other ""violent-video-game"" system -- ALL the games are ""G-rated"" AND educational.* Both boys and girls can play AND enjoy these games.All LeapFrog products (Leapster, LeapPad, etc.) are VERY well-rated for age and educational level. Be sure to pay attention to the age recommendations, and don't waste your time or frustrate you child by pushing them too far ahead with this system. I do NOT recommend it for very slow 4-year-olds or younger children, NOR do I recommend it for very young children who do not understand how to treat expensive toys with SOME respect (although ours has withstood quite a bit of abuse from both child AND her klutzy Mom &lt;g>!). Contrary to appearances, the optional carrying case is good for keeping the game from damage, as well as keeping the games together.The ""L-Max"" system costs a little more, but has some features you might be interested in. If you opt NOT to get it, rest assured that the ""L-Max"" games ARE supposed to work with the regular ""Leapster"" system, minus a couple of abilities that the TV-compatible L-Max System uses, and that your child supposedly won't notice.If you can afford it, I recommend the optional recharging unit, as rechargable batteries don't tend to last long in the Leapster (they lose their charge if left standing, even when a device is off). If you go with store-bought batteries, the ones for electronic devices are worth the extra cost, as they really DO last longer (Energizer ""e"" batteries seem to last the longest for us.) If you go with batteries, be sure to keep an extra set on hand for those ""Hey!-I-was-in-the-middle-of-a-game!"" moments!",Kids_games

He used to run back and forth between the driver's lap and the passenger seat, trying to get a peak out the window. His favorite was using the driver's left leg as a booster to look out the window. He whined the first two car rides for a little bit but settled down quickly and now jumps into the car seat as soon as we put him in the car. We also put a few seat cushions under the seat to boost it up a little higher and put a blanket in the seat so he's got more height and warmth. This is a great car seat for a reasonable price.

664,"The product is very effective. My dog looked horrible for 2 years and I tried many products. She is a creme colored shih tzu, but her eyes used to resemble a racoon. This product works for me. My suggestions---Start with a fine-toothed comb to remove the residue. Use scissors to trim the stained fur. Apply the liquid with a cosmetic pad to clean the area. Dab with the powder. I started with this process every day for about 3 weeks. Then I reduced it to 2 times a week for about 3 months. Now I just use it once a week for prevention and I am thrilled with the results. Some tips---Their non-woven application pads are unnecessarily expensive. You can find these at a drugstore(do NOT use cotton balls as they do not work). Keep the fur short in this area by trimming every several weeks. The trimming removes the unsightly fur in the beginning but also keeps the area drier and prevents future staining. Now that I am on the once a week cycle, occassionally I will comb out some minor residue mid-week. I initially bought the starter kits but found that the 1/2oz powder lasts longer the 2oz liquid. In my experience, the 4oz liquid matched with the 1/2oz powder is the optimal buying combination.",Pet_care

I liked the design enough, and after losing the replacement stopper, that I decided to try replacing it.I ordered another one a couple of weeks ago and, when it arrived, the plastic strap holding the stopper cap was already broken. So I sent it back for a replacement, which was prompt in arriving. This one was not only was broken when it arrived but the stopper cap was missing completely - which is why I had ordered another one in the first place.At this point, I decided to stick with the original unit and keep a small stock of cork or rubber stoppers handy.The notable flaws in the design are; the plastic used for the cap/stopper assembly is inappropriate (will not handle the requisite flexing to operate the stopper) and the plastic strap for the stopper sticks out from the flat side of the canteen so one has to carry it with the bowl against the body, so one has the choice of getting wet from the bowl or having the plastic strap edge poking you. After the stopper broke off I trimmed back the leftover plastic on the cap to allow me to carry it with the canteen against my body which is much more comfortable.It's a nice idea, but the design is flawed and the quality control is poor, Amazon should at least look a the products it sells prior to delivery to ensure it is in operational form/has all the parts.",Pet_care

Luckily I bought this promptly after adopting a rescue dog because turns out she wasn't too used to being in a car and threw up. This seat cover worked great. It kept the mess off the seats and was easily cleaned. The fit of the seat cover, surprisingly, fits better in my car than my girlfriends but I think this is because I have rear headrests and she doesn't. To secure it in her car we tilt the seat forward (such as to gain trunk access) and put the straps behind the corner of the seat then set it back in place.The seat cover has a lot of versatility. It adapts well and easily between my car and my girlfriend's and covers the whole seat. We've been using it for 5 months now and it has doubled as a barrier keeping the hair off of the seats too (a plus when you want to take the cover out and not have to vacuum before having passengers). It also keeps dirty paws from getting on the interior, and to clean it just take it out and shake and you're good to go (unless there was throw up, then a washing machine comes in handy).Generally with my reviews, I apply a Zagat-style rating to it. That is, what were my expectations and how much did the product meet them. In light of this, I give it 5 stars because it met my expectations spot on and I am considering purchasing a second. I recommend this for a car-sick prone dog (or cat?) or any dog that may shed a lot, but also it's great for keeping the dirt from their paws from getting on the interior.",Pet_care

Also, if you have a portable or in-car tv, you can hook this game system up to it so your child can play it in the car like a leapster, although it may require buying a cheap RCA adapter from radio shack or walmart or somewhere.The games are a little difficult for younger children (3 to 4), and our little one did get a little frustrated at first trying to make turns. But you can pretty much just drive the train randomly around and still play the game.Right now there are really no console games (wii, playstation, xbox) out there for 3-4 year olds.

This is now how I knock him out if he's bored or a bit stressed over another cat in the yard. Works like a charm. He's a Turkish Van cat and a mellow fellow anyway.

The packaging is pretty and the presentation is really girly in a grown up girl kinda way.It goes on bright and clean, with a bit of sparkle to it, like sugar cookies with pink sugar!

This ""puppy"" loves to sit on our furniture and, despite several weeks of training, he was winning the battle.When we received our Pet Barrier, we immediately set it up and gave it a try. At first he didn't know what was happening when he felt the shock but quickly learned where he could go and where the ""forbidden"" boundry is. After about a week of wearing the collar when in the living room, he now adheres to the boundry without wearing the collar. When he does try to test it, we put the collar back on him as a reminder and that's all he needs. He has one chair that he's allowed to lay in and he seems perfectly happy with that.I would recommend this product highly to anyone wanting to set barriers for their dog.",Pet_care

704,"I had to review this product after seeing how one person posted the pics of the crate being torn open by their puppy.First of all, I have the larger version of this crate and throughout all the years of owning and handling dogs, and all the various pens and crates, this one is one of my all time favorites!I bought mine for traveling to dog shows with my Dobe. It is way lighter than hauling around a wire pen and it folds down flat and easy to carry. I love the ventilation it offers and the ease of opening the top, etc.OBVIOUSLY...........this pen is NOT designed for any dog that is somewhat destructive...such as puppies...DUH! So for anyone dumb enough to assume so, then they deserve what they get! This pen also wouldn't be easy for a puppy in the sense that there is no easy way to clean it, such as a removable pan, etc. So if your puppy messed his pen you would have to crawl in there and clean it rather than pull the pan out. Another common sense thing you can foresee.I am rating this product with 5 stars. It is VERY well made. I do agree that the materials have an odor. I have had mine for years now, and it still has somewhat of an odor.I love the weight and ease of moving it and setting it up and down. I would highly recommend this product to any responsible *intelligent* dog owner.",Pet_care

He would creep up to it and lick its tongue.. then run away when we squeezed it and the tongue flipped out.. after some introduction, he was all over this thing. Absolutely loved it. 1 day later we looked at the poor dragon and his tongue was missing! and one of his toes were gone too... :( I thought it would be more durable then it was.. I'm sure our puppy ended up eating these missing rubber parts despite our careful supervision. Also, we were concerned about the make/ coloring of the dragon. This was made in China? is there a possibility of lead in the coloring? (flashback; all the toy recalls in china).. Our puppy never got sick or anything, just our paranoid thoughts. anyway, though our puppy loved it, this is why I gave it only 3 stars.",Hair_products
706,"Memoir '44 fits into the ""war games"" genre of board games. The game pits the Allied forces against Germany in a series of battles that take place in France during 1944. Each scenario includes an historical background of the battle at hand, instructions on how to set up the board, and the victory conditions. The double-sided board accommodates battles on the beach and in the French countryside. Terrain tiles are used to recreate the scene - forests, hills, hedgerows, towns, rivers, bridges, and bunkers all offer strategic advantages in battle. Both sides are allocated a certain number of infantry, artillery, and armor (tanks) in each battle. Each type of unit has its advantages and disadvantages, and players must decide when and where to move these units. Moving units around the board is not a free-for-all. Players are limited by the actions available on command cards in their hands. While eliminating enemy units is the most common way to achieve victory, players can also win by accomplishing strategic objectives such as liberating towns or securing bridges.The best way to play Memoir '44 is to play as one side, then reset the board and play as the other side. You can set up the board and play both sides in about 90 minutes. The base game is designed for two players but can be played with more. With a second copy or a special expansion, up to eight players can take part in epic battles called Overlord scenarios. Additional expansions allow you to fight in eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific. While the base game comes with 16 battle scenarios, additional scenarios are included with each expansion and in a hardcover ""campaign"" book. Plus, the Memoir '44 web site has hundreds of free user-created scenarios.I haven't played Memoir '44 as much as some other games in my collection, but it's easily my favorite war game (and I've played many games of Risk and Axis & Allies).",Kids_games

708,"I bought these scissors to trim around the ears and eyes of my dogs. I would say for the price, the quality is just average, and the sharpness could have been better. I have a pair of the round tip scissors I had gotten at a local drug store for much less to use on people, and I would say the quality is just as good (if not better). These scissors are lightweight, but the opening for the fingers is a bit small, and they don't seem to have any bulk to them...thus feeling flimsy. I will need to sharpen them before I use them again.Regarding the case they came in. It's okay, but I know over time, the snap is going to break off as it doesn't feel like it's great quality either.Overall, they rate to me as just average. I really think you can do just as well buying these type of scissors at a local drug store or discount store (Target, K-Mart, WalMart), or even at a discount beauty supply store for lots less...perhaps saving $5 or more. That's just my opinion. Hope this helped you decide what to do.",Pet_care
709,"My husband bought this late at night with out checking with me. I told him I didn't think the cats will like it. He set it up anyway. I have no clue if that was easy or hard.The odds are about 2 to 1, I'd say. For every mess or two outside the kitty toilet, we get one in. Now that could be considered a good or bad thing, depending upon how you look at it. Good in that they got their aim right and overcame their fear of the toilet, bad in that if the arm grabber thing didn't get all the poo, the garage is going to smell like baked cat poop. Now this is a scent that is worse than the smelliest skunk. The other problem is that the grinder doesn't always work. So it gets stuck mid-cycle. Then sometimes you've got a watery litter box. I've never known a cat that likes that. So that means more messes on the garage floor. OH and then you've got to take it apart and clean out the grinder thing. Get your gloves and prepare for cat poop soup. This is with the new improved one that they are offering that was supposed to fix this problem. It gets through about 4 or so cycles now before getting stuck, whereas before it got stuck every time. So, I guess that is still improvement.I think this is a brilliant idea. Too bad the cats hate it and it doesn't always work. Maybe someday they'll get it right. If there was a way to make it bigger, so the cats fit it in, and then make it stronger, it might work.Finally convinced my husband to go back to a regular box. I am going to try a biddy cat.

It never really gets old, as the game almost never starts out the same, and everything is open to the management of the player, from setup to attacks. Some players may be put off by the fact that you can't see the rank of your opponents' pieces, but that rule is, like any other, one that can be accepted. 12 dollars is an absolute steal for this game.

It dried my hair in about 7 minutes, which is about half the time of my old dryer (which wasn't even a bad dryer to begin with). My hair came out looking so much smoother and more tame, and as a result I spent less time with the flat iron. I have the companion Remington T-studio 2-1/4"" Flat IronRemington S-9400 Tstudio Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Tourmaline 2 1/4"" Wide Plates, and LOVE it just as much.

As I said, I gave the benefit of the doubt where the wet marks was so close to the edge of the pad.

I know that they are painted like a car, but I doubt a 1 yr old knows that. I am afraid that she will get confused and think the block is a car. Also all of the objects are shaped like blocks, so a block is being called a car, truck, school bus, pig, baby, etc... (meaning the other barn and house sets, too). I think this could cause some identification problems. I surely hope that Leapfrog tested this being a educational toy company and all.

Also, for babies that cannot stand yet, you can have no legs on it to sit on their lap, or have only two legs on it so it tilts towards them. The one year old can easly reach everything sitting on his knees. The product is very light, so the one year old can push it around, but this is easily solved by having it up against the wall. He can still reach all of the activities. Overall great product, very colorful and educational. I would definitely buy it again!",Kids_games

We placed a baby gate at the top of the stairs and let her out with this ball and she just goes nuts over it. I don't see much damage to the ball after about 30 minutes of play. At 10"" it is just a bit too large to get her mouth around so her teeth only scratch the surface. It is somewhat heavy and hard so I don't think I'd use it in the house but on a deck or in the yard or a room with hard walls (e.g paneled, brick, etc.) this ball would work great.",Pet_care

There's plenty of room for blankets, toys etc. She considers this her den and loves it. It's handy because it can be taken apart for traveling, or set up in the yard although we haven't used it outside yet. The 4 panel is shorter, so if you have a jumper, and our Shih Tzu is like a rabbit, you may want to go with the larger pen. The gate has also held up well and is easy to use.

My daughter likes to play with the puppy but gets frustrated because it doesn't finish a song or phrase.

It has even started talking in the middle of the night when no one is around it! It is just sitting there all by itself. Scared me to death. Now I make sure to turn it off.

I also have hormonal breakouts and the occasional cystic pimple. So I'd recommend this to people with mild to moderate acne and flareups.I tried this when it first came out because the reviews were so positive, and it worked great for me. Definitely worked better than ProActiv, at a lower price and without the hassle of a monthly bill and getting stuck in an auto-shipment.It doesn't smell bad- not great, but it doesn't smell like you're putting a ton of acne stuff on your face. And I love the two different lotions you get. The day lotion is great, light, and has SPF. The night lotion is heavier and great at zapping zits. The cleanser is gentle but exfoliating. All together, the system works great.I do wish the individual lotions/cleanser were sold separately. It's convenient having them all in a kit, but I ran out of everything at different times. I used up the cleanser first, then the day lotion, then the night lotion. But I had to buy a whole new kit and replace everything, so it seemed a little wasteful. Also, like any acne kit, this can be drying, so you may need another moisturizer, especially in the winter.My skin has calmed down since I first used this, but I'd still recommend this. Try this product first before you call an informercial- of all the acne systems I've used, this one gave me the best results.",Hair_products

Out of the three sets of toys released with the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, this is the best-looking Aragorn figure yet. We get him here in his Gondorian garb that he wears for the final battle before the Black Gates of Mordor, the emblem of the White Tree upon his chest, Anduril in his hand. This is Aragorn the King.This figure is super-posable -- a ton of articulation. Toy Biz, it seems has found the way to give us articulation without sacrificing the look of an action figure -- this is a toy that both looks great and plays great.The only complaint I would have is that the box says that Aragorn can hold Anduril two-handed, and I haven't been able to get mine to do that -- he's quite articulated, but the arms don't bend inwards quite enough to allow that pose.All in all, though, it's a great action figure, and a must for ROTK fans.",Kids_games

820,"This is a very thoughtfully designed, well crafted, set.The chess board (not the unit) measures right at 8 cm square. (That's a little over 3 inches.) The plastic pieces adhere to a standard Staunton design. The color scheme for both board and pieces is intelligent and standard, meeting the needs of experienced players.When closed (i.e., the top on), a game in progress will retain its position. The captured pieces will stay in their compartments (at each end of the board). There is no need to fear the unit's being shaken or turned upside down when the unit is closed. Before you do open it, give the unit a little lateral shake. That will settle any captured pieces most comfortably in their compartments before you remove the lid.The one characteristic that will concern some people is the small size of the pieces, but they are proportioned to the size of the board. If the size of the pieces causes a problem, then you are looking for a larger set.Will it fit in a pocket? Well, it will fit in my shirt pocket, but I wouldn't want to carry it that way normally. It's approximately an inch thick, and about 3.75 x 5.5 inches. It fits comfortably in the hand, and, when in use, the top lid fits the unit as a bottom, so that everything stays together. It is very portable.In addition to the set, you get two extra white queens, two extra black queens, two extra white pawns, and two extra black pawns. The queens are in the event of pawn promotions, and the pawns are presumably because they are statistically the most likely to get lost, since half of the army consists of pawns.Although inexpensive peg chess sets (&lt;$10 US) were once easily procured, they are difficult to find these days.

Babies really like the crinkly squishy shapes, and it would have been better if the birds didn't have eyes that can come off and become choking hazards. It says its for babies 8 months and above probably because of the eyes. Of course any babies younger wouldn't know how to use the shape sorter but they would probably enjoy feeling the birds and squishing them and chewing on them. Without the eyes I think this toy would be for a broader age range.",Kids_games

After rolling my hair on the rod, I use a hair comb/clip to keep it in place. This product has more rods than the some other models by other manufacturers. I think that makes it a more attractive buy.",Pet_care

While the sent is not light, neither is it heavy like many other scents that try to achieve this effect.

842,"If you like Risk then get this game as quick as you can.The addition of the commanders, the cards, the moon and the underwater cities are great. But what really sets this game apart is the addition of 'energy' and the limited number of rounds.You acquire energy at the start of your turn just like reinforcement troops. You use the energy to buy commanders and cards but you also use it to bid for turn order. The new turn order at the start of each round adds all kinds of new strategies to the game. I hope other games pick up this idea.The limited number of rounds means you know the game will be over in a couple of hours instead of lasting all night like the old game. We usually play two or three five player games in one night. It also means no more sitting around building up forces.

854,"My husband and I got the fydo collar for our long-haired chihuahua. The Fydo collar wouldn't have been our first choice, but our Chihuahua idolizes her big sister, a Terrier Mix who loves to swim. When our Chihuahua took to the water, the collar had to change. I found the Fydo collar by accident looking for the Gummipet collar (which our terrier wears). If it hadn't been on sale here at Amazon for and outrageously low price ($5 for the small solid pink one) we probably wouldn't have bought one.For the most part, we really like it. I'll break down our likes and dislikes for easy reading.PROS:1) Waterproof - gotta love that!2) Stylish and unusual - Dog collars for my girls are something that I spend far too much money on. I love waterproof collars (since they're both water dogs) but so many of them are so ugly. The Fydo collars (and the Gummipets collars) are both fairly stylish in terms of waterproof dog collars.3) ""No chew"" latch system - this one is also an AWESOME addition. Our chihuahua will chew on a 1cm length of spare collar until there's nothing left but a ragged edge. We do like that there are no ""chewable"" ends.4) Personalization - hubby and I have taken out the metal ""Fydo"" insert to make our own (more on this below in the CON section).CONS:1) The pink color seems to stain or dirty easily. Considering how much time our dogs spend in the water, I would think the collar would look less dirty. But it constantly looks like its got a thin layer of grunge on it, even when I wipe it off with baby wipes.2) FYDO metal insert - oy, vey, this was a design flaw. It's a little too heavy and falls out easily, but I do like the design of the collar, so I create my own inserts. For those Fydo owners who are frustrated by the hole left in the collar by the missing insert, I have taken to making my own. I found a background from the internet that matches the collar and seems appropriate (for my pup it was rainbow daisies), pasted that to Powerpoint and customized her name, our phone number, and other information in the space. I cut it out in the oval shape and laminate it (I have a laminator at home) and it looks great, its waterproof, its custom, and it costs me only pennies to make.3) Latch system - I really do like the collars system of ""no chew"" ends, but sometimes the latch can be incredibly difficult to undo if you need to remove the collar. I've found that if you undo the inside one first, the oustide one will be easier to unlatch.Overall, my husband and I are quite happy. I would love to buy her the transparent blue, but will wait for it to go on sale again.",Pet_care

856,"I LOVE this shampoo! Since September, I've been searching high and low for a shampoo that will remove flakiness, product build up and be gentle in my relaxed hair and this product fits the bill! I was fortunate to discover this product at one of my local Sephora stores approximately 2 weeks ago and I'm glad that I decided to give it a chance. This is one of the very few shampoos that lives up to its promise. It's definitely appropriate for dry hair and scalp and I love how it has a creamy texture. In my experience, runny/liquidy type shampoos are rough and drying on my relaxed hair. Creamy shampoo types are the way to go. Even BEFORE rinsing out the shampoo, I could feel how soft my hair was and after rinsing out the product, I was actually able to comb through my hair with ease (using a regular size comb) BEFORE applying conditioner! This shampoo combined with Ojon Tawaka Conditioner makes my hair amazingly soft and frizz free! If it wasn't for the ridiculous high price (i.e., $30 CAD), I would have rated this shampoo a 5-star. Finally, I would definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone with dry hair and scalp.",Hair_products
857,"I bought this toy for my son and he absolutely loves it. All of his toys seem to get a one or two day play/attention lifespan from him which is pretty normal for most young kids. But this toy has yet to fall from grace. It's played with almost all day, everyday.The attention to detail is great and it has amazing posing possibilities. It's a versatile toy if you have some of the Original Trilogy figures... no need to buy a Darth since this Anakin doll can be transformed into the evil Lord Vader. If only Hasbro and Lucas would issue a similar figure for Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in which he could transform into Darth Sidious.The only draw back to this toy -- AND THIS IS A BIG ONE -- is that the top of the helmet doesn't secure to top of the Anakin/Vader head and constantly falls off during play. And of course, as mentioned in other reviews on this page... those darned boots (for both the Anakin and the Darth costumes) are almost impossible to get back on once taken off.",Kids_games

I've tried them all.And then I found the Revlon RV059C. It heats up extremely quickly and is super hot. Sure, it caught a few hairs between the plates and ripped them out, but once I learned how to use it, this didn't happen as often. It straightened my hair fast (only took about 10 minutes) and got it silky smooth. I loved it!Then it broke. The red light wouldn't work, and the plates wouldn't heat up. I kept it going for a while by banging it on the counter to jar the red light, but soon it died for good.Of course, I thought, it was just this particular one. So I went out and bought a new one which worked beautifully - for about 3 months. Then presto, one plate stopped working. Simply wouldn't heat up.OK, I thought. This is not the same problem as the last one. Maybe it's a fluke. Maybe I have just had bad luck. Maybe I shouldn't buy another one from the same company.

For one thing, I didn't think that a toy company whose reputation rested on making replicas of Eminem and other sort of fringe genre figures would be able to appreciate the delicate art of pleasing the very demanding (myself included) group of hardcore Trekkers out there.I was wrong. Art Asylum has done a superb job with the Star Trek contract, and has turned out the most beautiful set of toys I've seen, toys definitely meant for the 'adult collector' range of buyers. And this model of the Enterprise NX-01 is the jewel in the crown.I purchased it right away when it came out almost a year ago, and was immediately struck by the quality and detail of the design. Clearly the creators of this 'toy' were thinking about its potential as a display item as much as a toy -- the stand, for example, is much sturdier than the more flimsy versions that have come out with previous starship models and attaches to the ship in a clever and ingenious way.About the only downside to this model is there are some fit and finish issues which could have been improved, and to get the full effect, you have to download and attach some decals from their website.

I have really dry hands and this product didn't do much to help make them feel softer. The lotion is very runny and took quite a while to absorb, even though their bottle says, """"absorbs quickly."""" I do like that it's fragrance-free and doesn't contain mineral oils, though. It might be all right for moderate to dry skin, but not strong enough for severely dry skin.",Hair_products
902,"I registered for this item on my baby registry because it looked cute. Lucky for me some of my relatives actually used the registry because this was one of my gifts. I put it in the crib with my daughter when she moved to the crib (around 2 mos old) we would feed her, turn pooh on and before he stopped singing, she was fast asleep. By four months old she had learned to turn him back on if she woke up during the night(we could hear the music through the monitor) we woke up from this every once in a while, but usually it didn't even disturb us at all. We found that pooh had to go everywhere with us. We are a military family so we both live far from home, but pooh goes home with us on every visit. It works great because it provides her a piece of home when she sleeps and she is much happier waking up when pooh is with her. The nightlight makes it even better because we have just enough light to leave the room with without running into one of her many other items and disturbing her. This was something we couldn't live without.",Kids_games

904,"My daughter received this as a gift when she was 7 months and when she began trying to pull up, it would tip and often fall on her. She is a small baby, so it wasn't her size that did it. I had to eventually put it away until she was old enough to stand on her own, but now she loves it!!! She is constantly dancing to it, and the music isn't loud, annoying, or long. I would recommend this for babies who won't use it for balance. She did get her arm caught in it, but that only happened because she had stuck another toy (not the balls which are included) down in the middle and wouldn't let go of it !",Kids_games

However, this has a good standard scent that you can't go wrong with. It doesn't last as long as some of the more expensive colognes though. In my experience after using about 10 different cologne types/brands, you actually do get what you pay for. If you are wondering why the top ranked colognes every year are usually the most expensive, there is a reason for that. I would rank this cologne in the middle to lower-middle tier. Far better than some of the cheaper colognes but nothing compared to the higher tiers.",Perfumes

The thing is that after a few weeks I perceive its smell very differently. It is not dull vanilla anymore, but spicey candy. Now it is like a mix of cinnamon and vanilla, and I like it very much.The scent has long staying power and you need to spray only a small amount.I also like the perfume Passion, from Elizabeth Taylor.As for White Diamonds and Diamonds and Zapphires, I just cannot get to like those perfumes, no matter how many times I try them. Diamonds and Zapphires is the worst for me, it smells like a pungeant acid. I have to shower after putting it on because I cannot stand the sour scent of jasmine.",Perfumes

914,"I have had my conair flat iron for over 6 years and have never had a problem with it. I figured I was in the market for an updated flat iron so...I have been reading reviews for all of the flat irons. Price wasn't an issue, and honestly I didn't see much of a difference in price vs value. I brought home a Hot Tools flat iron, tried it and hated it! It pulled my hair and was really weird to work with. Tried the Chi, was good, but didn't love it. So I brought it back and decided to go with the pink Remington. I love that it has an automatic turn off in an hour if you forget about it. It displays the degrees digitaly and heats up super fast. It is so easy to manuever and the top isn't hot, so you can use your fingers/both hands to guide the iron and won't burn yourself. Best of all it works great and doesn't pull my hair. It was so smooth going down my hair. I am really glad that I did all of my homework on irons, although what I really learned was expensive doesn't mean that its' better...just more expensive. So I saved money buying the Remington Tourmaline vs a Chi and instead went all out on hair care products(Biosilk) and Hair Mask(Neutrogena Hair mask)etc.. to protect my hair from the heat. You have to buy them anyway no matter which flat iron you use, might as well get the good ones!",Pet_care
915,"I bought a small and a medium for my cat and dog. Both pets took to the beds immediately.I think the key thing here is ""value"", these beds are a bit thin but they were very cost effective and the quality is reasonalby good. I worry a bit about my dog, she weighs about 50-60 (a lab) and I don't feel this provides much padding for her but it's definately better than laying directly on a hard floor. This being her 'indoor' back up bed, it is very easy to move around, or even wash so it serves my purpose very well. The whole bed is light and one piece, you just put the whole thing in the wash machine; I don't suspect it is going to last for ever but again, I think it was a good value.I gave it a 5 star due to the value, I realize this isn't the best bed but it is everything I expected and more at this price range.",Pet_care

The littlest one was 1.25 lbs and with taking this, eating well and a visit to the vet, she was over two pounds in short order.

And while they do the job, they're heavy to move and always pinch my fingers and scratch my floors! What the heck took me so long to buy this very attractive, lightweight but durable gating? My four dogs (chihuahua and maltese) are all under 12 lbs so I got the 24"" height which is perfect. I did purchase the two extension panels to create a six-panel pen so I could put an XL wee-wee pad at one end (of the rectangle) and the dogs' water bowls at the other. I was, however, pleasantly surprised to see how wide the individual panels are (much wider than the panels on the metal gating) so the four-panel pen is actually quite roomy. If I didn't need to include a wee-wee pad, the four-panel pen would be more than sufficient for one or two dogs at a time. This pen is sturdy and easy to assemble and move about the room. Assembling the door latch is a bit tricky but a few minutes of uninterrupted concentration and it was done. Without question, this was a best purchase!",Pet_care
925,"Other players -- master tacticians and fanboys obsessed with Puerto Rico -- can give you a far more technical and analytical review. What I would like to emphasize is that this is a game that is never predictable and never boring. The next game of Puerto Rico you play will probably be 180 degrees different from the last one. Yes, some people play it with laser-eyed intensity and an intolerance for the less-than-optimum move. But we normal people :-) can have a good time playing with our friends and still exercise our minds, sharpen our strategies and have a whole lot of fun. The creator of Puerto Rico must be an unusual person. The game he gave us is so well thought out, so finely tuned and perfectly balanced, that you never feel the outcome is decided halfway through, as in so many games where the player gaining an early advantage retains control for the rest of the boring, exasperating game. There are so many things going on, so many paths one may follow, that it's impossible to ""control"" this game. Which makes it a lot more fun. That's the main thing. It's great fun for intelligent people. And very well-crafted, too. The game boards are heavy, with attractive graphics and colors, and cute, simple little game pieces that are fun to handle. It feels like quality and adds to the pleasure. Without question Puerto Rico is the pinnacle as far as board games go. Not even Settlers of Catan or Princes of Florence can equal it.",Kids_games
926,"My 5 month old kitten had never used a covered litter box (to my knowledge) so I was nervous he'd be afraid to try it. Not only was he jumping in it while I was setting it up (he jumped in and used the base before I could get the cover on), I actually watched him make a decision to use it. I kept his old box so he could transition into this new one. He ran into the kitchen to his old box, stopped short, looked at the booda dome, back at his old box, and happily trotted into the booda dome. So cute! So I immediately took his old box away and he's been using his booda dome since. He's tiny, but he's got a lot of extra room in this box so I think it will be fine for when he's full grown. It really is a big box - way bigger than the traditional rectangle one I had. The only thing is I would NOT recommend buying the booda dome liners. They barely fit the box and come loose as kitty does his thing. I purchased these liners:Cat Litter Box Drawstring Liners 15-pk. - XLand the drawstring is great for keeping the liner in place and making the clean up job super easy.

It allows so much room for a little bunny. In the warmer weather, she can stay outside in the pen while my kids swim in the pool or chase each other around. We can also attach it to the Rabbit Run.

The balls pop out with just enough speed, enough to send the balls flying but not hurt if the ball hits you in the face. My one year old has a great time finding objects to insert into the launch tube. Pens do not work :) However, the design is amazingly kid tolerant, nothing really damages it. I love how the dish and ramp are made of a softish plastic so when you (inevitably) trip onto it, it does not cause too much injury.The only problem I can think of is that it works best when it is very level, otherwise the balls do not roll back into the feeder.

My dog figured it out right away! Barking == spraying, spraying == bad.I've found it's only taken a couple of days and he's completely stopped his night time proclamations.The barking behavior has completely stopped.Oh and as an added benefit, he had a nice lemony smell after his sessions with the collar.",Pet_care

980,"I discovered this hair cream in college over 11 years ago. This is the hand-down BEST texture/shine/hold paste out there. Better hold than a pomade. Smells nice but not sissy-smelling, adds great control and shine without looking like it's greased up or 'wet'. Not crunchy like a gel or greasy feeling like a pomade. Many guys use American Crew pomade. That stuff is utter crap compared to this. Get this stuff, you won't regret it.",Perfumes
981,Bought this arcade when my daughter was 6 mos. old. She started out pushing the balls through with her hands. She watched her 18 mo. old cousin use the hammer and she caught on. She loves the lights and music and has continued to play with this toy several months later. It's good for hand and eye coordination.,Kids_games
982,I loved this game when I was younger and ordered it for my children. But... this game is so cheaply made now! A thin cardboard bottom has the graphics (comes seperated not integrated) and rips VERY easily. The popper is of a thin bent metal tension design that doesn't pop reliably. Very frustrating! We ended up buying a vintage game on [auction site] and love it!,Kids_games

985,My daughter loves this toy-she plays with it all the time!I agree that it's insanely noisy but after a couple rounds you tune it out.It's given her lots of practice with her motor skills and she loves the monkeys behind the door-she loves to peek-a-boo them.,Kids_games
986,"So I brought this product on a whim. I started looking up products to help clear blemishes. I came across this product and read a couple of reviews and decided to purchase it. After moving from Austin, TX (dry climate) to Baton Rouge, LA (very humid) my skin went crazy. I had some breakouts that were stubborn and hard to treat. I bought this product because I have oily, blemish prone skin. After the first two or three applications my skin started to improve drastically, let's also take into account that my skin had started to improve on its own given the fact that I had been here for a couple months. It does an EXCELLENT job treating acne before it actually occurs. If you feel sore spots on your skin but there is no raised bump yet, this is perfect for that cause they'll never actually erupt into a breakout if treated with Bye Bye Blemish. Even though I have oily skin I ONLY use it once a day and at night. It can cause excessive drying but I have FOLLOWED the directions so I have not had this problem. It has faded my blemishes also, but I believe that its strength lies in treating acne. It can prevent breakouts and with proper moisturization your skin can heal and you can prevent blemishes from occurring. Also, I do not use the product everyday because it can cause extra drying when used properly. I use an oil free moisturizer daily and sometimes I will give my skin a day off so that it can heal on its own between treatments. Some reviews discussed how the product smells. It's not bad at all. The most important aspect of it all is that it actually WORKS. All you need to do is follow the directions and create a reasonable regimen that works for your skin.",Hair_products
987,"When I read the reviews of this cat toy, I was skeptical. I mean ... c'mon ... feathers attached to fishing pole? How creative.Little did I know, my kitty would think this was the best thing EVERRRR.She played so hard that she actually started panting. And even when she's on the verge of having a kitty heart attack, she STILL wanted to play with it! At this point, I had to put it away - hid it in a closet - and she STILL kept at it, trying to open the closet door.Do not let your cat play with this toy unsupervised, if he/she's anything like my Gremlin, he/she will DESTROY this toy. As in, eat the feathers. Om nom nom. So yeah, be sure to put the toy away or else you will be going through attachments like water.As for the fiberglass splinter issue ... again, don't let your kitty nibble on the wand. I covered the handle part with electrical tape to prevent splintering.",Kids_games

990,"Let me first start with the fact that I have six cats. Three of them have long hair. The Cat Genie says it is recommended for up to three cats. It was very easy to get the cats switched from the conventional litter box to the Cat Genie, it worked just as the instructions said it would. There have been very few accidents, and these only happen when the unit gets plugged up. I like the Cat Genie a lot, but with as many cats as I have, I have to take more care of it than someone with fewer cats. At least once a week, it plugs up. When this happens, I have to disassemble the entire thing, this is not a hard task but it can be messy. About half the back ups are due to the permanent litter getting into the drain opening and stopping things up. The other half of the time, it is hair. The literature recommends brushing your cats frequently, and they mean it!I would make a couple of design changes if I were the manufacturer. I would put some kind of scraper at the top of the rim to scrape the permanent litter off the rim of the rotating bowl when it backs up behind the scoop. Or I would change the angle of the scoop so that the litter wouldn't back up to the top of the bowl rim. I would also put an abort button on the unit to stop the cleaning cycle when the unit gets plugged up. Too much of the permanent litter ends up in the inner workings of the Cat Genie, which contributes to the clogs. Most of the litter than ends up inside is stuck to the scoop and gets shaken off into the solid waste hopper. Perhaps a few more shakes before the solid stuff gets dropped into the hopper. It would be nice if I could set it up to clean more than four times a day. I frequently run manual cycles to keep up with the output of my six cats. Again, the Cat Genie is very clear in its literature that it is designed for up to three cats. I am pushing the envelope with six.I like the Cat Genie, but it needs a couple of tweaks. I am so happy not to have to clean a conventional litter box and deal with the litter and litter dust all over the house. No lingering smells either. I'm not sure how the cats feel about it, but they seem to want to use it and they are no longer afraid the the noise.",Pet_care

992,"After watching the movie Zathura, we were very excited to play this game. However, the game is so poorly constructed we couldn't even play it. The cards in the console do not come out, and the spinner, which you are supposed to ""spin"" on your turn, does not spin at all, barely moving from one number to the next. I suppose you could play this game with a dice and simply turn the cards over, but it would not be as fun, and would certainly not feel like you were playing the game as displayed in the movie.",Kids_games
993,"I'm in my late 20s and a lifetime nail / cuticle biter. I bought this product not because my hands looked nasty (although they did), but because I was told (twice) that my incessant nail biting was making me look incredibly unprofessional during meetings and actually impacting my career. Yikes!This product has cured what endless amounts of money spent on manicures couldn't fix - it's been about 3 weeks and my hands don't even go near my mouth. I'm rating it 4-stars based on a few caveats:1) I didn't read carefully and was surprised when the 3 containers arrived - they were tiny! Each container holds 0.25 oz which is a lot less than what I imagined based on the product picture. It's no big deal, you don't need any more.2) The horrendous taste lasts for a while, but they do wear off after washing your hands. I found that the taste became ""manageable"" for an addicted biter after about 3 washes. Be prepared to reapply throughout the day.3) The cream is quite sticky. I'd apply and then have to wash my hands to remove the stickiness - which obviously counts towards your 3 washes mentioned above.4) It could actually impact your meal choices as finger foods become a non-option.Side note",Pet_care

If you have an infestation though it will not work by itself, no product will. You have to treat your pets with advantage or a similar product and then thoroughly clean all of your carpets, bedding, upholstered furniture, drapes etc. before spraying this product. After spraying you have to continue to vacuum the entire house thoroughly at least every other day for a week or two to break the life cycle. This is the same product that pest control companies use and they will ask that you do all of the cleaning mentioned above before they'll treat your house. You may as well save some money and do it yourself.",Pet_care

1003,"Just want to give you a little of my hair background...I was suffering from grown out roots and some left over red semi-permanent dye in my hair...basically technicolor hair (eww)! My main color is my natural color-Dark Ash Blonde/Light Ash Brown, then there's Blonde in my bangs and on the side of my head, and Black underneath, plus some residual color left over from experimenting with Red semi-permanent dye.So I decided to dye my hair, all except the Black and some of the Blonde on the side, a Light Ash Brown color to camouflage the exposed roots. This made my natural color golden/brassy :\!! I def wasn't going to have this fixed at a salon because of $$, so I immediately began research on a good color correction shampoo and found Shimmer Lights. I consulted with a friend who's a hair stylist and she, too, recommended this.I washed my hair with this shampoo and after the first rinse I saw some of the residual red color come out-it had been in my hair for six months! It also made the blonde brighter, which was expected. I noticed a slight difference in the brassiness, but not much so I repeated and left the lather on for 5 minutes...still didn't notice much change. After I repeated a Third time for 15 minutes, my hair appeared better with barely any brass tone.I have fine hair and noticed that this shampoo def dries out the hair-I think you're only supposed to use it like once a week. Just much sure you thoroughly condition your hair after this! I didn't buy the matching conditioner-just used a lot of my regular Suave stuff. My hair feels nice now because of the conditioner plus I skipped a day of washing. Also, the smell is kind of nice-it's floraly.I now have used Shimmer Lights a Fourth time to try and achieve my desired tone. My hair looks soooo much better!! I plan on dying it darker for the Fall, but for now I'm satisfied :) I would definitely recommend Shimmer Lights Shampoo to peeps!",Pet_care

1008,"This review is for the Coconut Hand and Body Lotion. The Shikai lotions are nice on the skin and they are thicker like a body butter or body creme. I also appreciate that they do not use parabens and the like. There IS a Coconut scent to this one but it is more of a soft Coconut/Vanilla scent. Very pleasing, however as there is no real coconut oil in the product that was dissapointing. (Could be do to the fact that coconut oil does not have a long shelf life and Shakai opts out of many of the more toxic preservatives.) They do have some great healing ingredients like wheat germ, avacado oil, shea butter and borage seed oil, however due to the fact that the lotion IS PURE WHITE and none of these listed ingredients in their more natural - AND MOST BENEFICIAL STATE - are white in color then it is obvious that they have heavily refined the ingredients leaving only a fraction of the botanical actives from many of these fabulous plants. Still has a nice aroma and leaves the skin soft for a couple of hours at least.(Will not last on supper dupper dry skin. For that you will need a quality unrefined body oil or body butter, or just use 100% virgin coconut oil!)",Perfumes

The best cartridge for her age is the one called Baby Words (or simular to that title) and has a picture of a baby on.

My older children LOVE playing this game with their baby sister. The books are sturdy. The toy is great. It's not really a toy that baby can play much on his/her own.

She's a mid-sized dog, my roommate's ""Golden Doodle"" for those who follow hybrid breeds.To be fair, she does chew through toys pretty quickly, I had just hoped this one would be different given the reviews. Also, technically it's not the KONG material that tore, it appears to be the stitching around the bottom that she ripped through. And the stuffing that came out was not the mess that some toys have, it was actually an inner plush pouch, with a squeaker inside, that came out, so the toy is still usable... at 20 hours and counting... if it doesn't come apart any further it'd be acceptable in this state.I feel odd posting this rating since all the other reviews are 5 stars. We might try another KONG toy, maybe the snake. The thing was only $8 with shipping, and she's certainly enjoying it for as long as it lasts, so I can't give it a 1.About our prolific little chewer, she won't chew on rubber or plastic toys, she's just not interested.

1017,"This is NOT anywhere near as good as the Lite Brite I remember from childhood. Generally companies aim to improve thier products over time, but apparently Hasbro is only concerned with selling refill packs so that the poor child who gets stuck with this piece of junk can play with it more than 10 times. Gee, thanks. Now for an additional [...] my kid can enjoy his toy an additional 15 times. Real generous Hasbro. That's right -- the ""flat screen"" is really only black pieces of paper that you attach to the screen with the pegs, and once you've put a peg through the paper you cannot remove it without leaving a big, white hole. This leaves no room for error or change, something that was really frustrating for my son -- so much so that halfway through his first picture he asked if we could take it back to the store. Also, there's no ""On/Off"" switch. You turn it on by pressing a button, then 3 minutes later it turns off on it's own. How stupid is that? And the little compartment at the bottom that is used to store the pegs is IMPOSSIBLE to open. There is no way a child could get it open -- which could have been done on purpose, so that younger siblings don't get into and snack on the pegs -- but every time my husband or I manage to pry the thing open the pegs fly everywhere. Not cool. You'd think they could have come up with a better baby-proofing solution than that.

Even amongst all these games, Ricochet Robot ranks up there as one my favorite games of all time. This is mental stimulation at its best!I have to admit that this game is not for everyone and I have a hard time finding people to play this game with due to its brain-draining nature. It does not have the strategic or tactical depth of chess, but it is on par for mental stimulation.The best way to describe this game is; a MENSA logic puzzle in a board game.",Kids_games

But, after my experience with ordering this product online through Amazon the dog may not get it again, as I am not only upset with Amazon for allowing it, but also the manufacturer who passes on their damaged cans to the public through an online site. I ordered a case of this product and every can in the shipment has large dents in the can. And because of the location of the dents, on the inside cans, in the packaging, you can tell it wasn't damage done during shipping. These cans we packed that way. Never again will I order anything like this online. It has actually soured me on using Amazon.",Pet_care

1045,"We bought three of these for Christmas--what a HUGE disappointment. They do not fly worth a darn. One never ever got off the ground. The two that did fly could not be steered or controlled. They were endlessly bashing into the ceiling and then plummeting to the floor. They seemed fun for a few minutes until it became apparent that it was not a question of learning how to fly them--they just stink! Within two hours, the blade on one helicopter broke off after hitting the wall. All three went back to the store.Skip this one and get the Syma S107Syma S107/S107G R/C Helicopter - Bluefor about the same price. It's a MUCH better helicopter. You can steer it, control how high it flies, maneuver around the house--even under tables and chairs. The Syma helicopter even lands rather than crashing! I can't say enough good things about the Syma helicopter.",Kids_games

1050,"FURminator deShedding Tool for Cats, 1.75-Inch EdgeI haven't done a complete grooming with the Furminator, but I love it already. I have two shorthaired cats, and the one who has a fairly slick coat, with a moderate undercoat, loves getting brushed. The other, whose fur is more like a British Shorthair's - short but very thick & plush, and a really thick undercoat - disappears as soon as she sees a brush, no matter how soft. I've tried a slicker brush, the ZoomGroom, a regular hairbrush, and the soft grooming brush on her. She's fought all of these. So I wasn't too hopeful when I tried a few strokes with the Furminator as soon as I got it out of the package. Surprise! She merely glanced over her shoulder at the first stroke, then ignored it when I continued. For a cat who struggles to get away from any attempt at brushing, this reaction was a big relief. And even the few test strokes got out a lot of hair. Hurray! Now I can take care of her properly, just in time for spring shedding. The tool's easy to hold, with a nice ergonomic handle; has a handy blade protector that snaps on and off easily; and the blade is narrow enough to easily get into tight spots. Hardly takes any pressure at all while you're grooming, and it got out a lot of hair, even for the brief time I was testing it out. Very happy!",Hair_products

I thought it would go the way of all her other electronic toys and be played with for a few minutes and then put aside. I was wrong - the Princess activity book has held her attention for several weeks now and she plays with it for 20-25 minutes at a time (an eternity to a 4 year old!). She loves to play the games and especially enjoys when the princesses talk just to her and ask her questions. This has improved both her fine motor skills (pointing to the words in order) and her listening skills. Now we just need the princesses to do a math book too!!!,Kids_games

He eats his sometimes but he most definitely eats the other dog's poop, as soon as she goes!So I have to pick up poop every time 2 medium sized dogs go out in our backyard.

You hands don't get gross even if you're picking up loose stool, which I have been recently as one of my dog's is sick. I think they are a good bargain if you buy them in a packages of eight.I don't know how well they'd work if you had, say, a Great Dane, but they seem to have a good capacity.Biggest downside is they are hard to open, like a sticky plastic bag would be....you have to struggle a bit but it's understandable because they are on a roll!

I was even being certain to turn it off at night for bedtime and during the work day.With brand new batteries in, i would do a training session, and halfway through, the dog stopped responding. I checked the collar after increasing the level and it had turned off. This happened every time I tried to use the collar. called the manufacturer, and no luck, no refunds, no exchange, lousy service.I also work with a group of aggressive dogs working on training. at the trainer's behest, several participants are using electronic collars. the 2 participants using this one are not happy. either the stimulation is insufficient for their dog, or the battery issue gets to them.The collar worked well as a training tool when it was on, but the unpredictability of it turning of defeats the whole purpose-anyone who works with dogs knows inconsistency is the failure of training.",Pet_care
1061,"These are wonderful! For my complete review, please see the ""Pink Soft Claws"" page. I will repeat a bit here - the cat for whom I purchased this specific color is 12 years old and nearly completely deaf from ear tumors. He is my baby though! He had developed the habit of clawing me to get my attention, I guess because he couldn't hear me, so maybe he thought I couldn't hear him. I was not enjoying the sensation of being clawed to death on my left thigh as I sat at my desk! So I found this product and put them on him yesterday. What a relief! No more scratches on my, and now he can get my attention any time he needs to.He was completely unfazed when we installed these covers. My husband held the cat while I clipped off the tips of his claws and then glued the covers in place. He is an extremely fluffy long-haired cat, but we only managed to glue his fur to the claw cover once! If you are careful and thorough when smoothing the fur away from the claw, you won't catch it.I highly recommend these covers! They are a great alternative to getting clawed to pieces! ;-)",Pet_care

1063,"I was so excited to get this product, but after a couple weeks use, I started having the same problems as other reviewers. The clumps would stick to the rake and the bottom of the pan, and would jam it so the rake would get too heavy and couldn't lift it up high enough to dump it. I have two cats, and both of my cats have a tendency to use the same corner everytime, so that the waste receptacle was always full on one side and empty on the other, unless I constantly got in and redistributed. I would have to redistribute the clumps for the rake to work as well. Otherwise it was too heavy on one side and would get stuck. Then it tries a few more times to scoop the clumps up, but it is so noisy that it wakes you up with all its struggles in the middle of the night.I have had for about 5 months now, and this morning at 4am, it broke. The whole arm with the rake and the motor broke clean off, and I can see no way to repair it. However, after it broke, the motor continued to run and run until I got up and turned it off. I am quite disappointed, and do not plan to buy a second one and try again. I am surprised after reading all of the bad reviews that LitterMaid has not improved their product. I am also surprised they are even still in business. As soon as I can save some money, I am purchasing the Litter Robot.",Pet_care
1064,"We were excited to assemble this playset only to quickly realize that it's a very poorly constructed toy. From the get-go, removable pieces couldn't even stay in place and pieces were either falling off or tipping over. Definitely a frustrating thing for a young child. For the price that was paid, it should have been more durable. The only impressive thing about it is the detail they put into how the castle looks. Unfortunatly, I consider only one (out of two) main pieces of the castle to be functional (and somewhat entertaining) with its trap doors and levers. The second part is useless and is already stuffed in a bag with all its pieces fallen off--and we just bought it an hour ago! I'd invest in the action figures, which are better constructed, not these playsets. Truly a disappointment.",Kids_games

1099,"I used to walk and train large dogs and standardly used the Gentle Leader. The Gentle Leader is a must-have for owners who want to humanely train their dog to walk on a leash and follow commands without being pulled by the dog. The Gentle Leader goes over the dog's snout and clasps at the back of the neck. Your regular leash attaches to a ring that hangs below the chin (it is part of the Gentle Leader). Any time the dog pulls on the leash, his/her head will turn instead, which prevents him/her from pulling you. The dog doesn't get choked like pinch collars and collars with spikes do.All puppy and dog owners should use the Gentle Leader to train their pets to walk on a leash and follow commands. It gives you more control over the dog, which is safer for both of you, and makes training your dog to walk on a leash easier.",Kids_games

It tells you exactly what to write, or touch, in order to use all the options. Also, it is very educational. There are lots of games to play and things to do that spark the imagination. My daughter thinks it is great, as well. Even my teenage nephews has a great time with it and would like one of their own!!!! You do have to use the special paper, BUT, once you write or draw something, you can reuse it over and over. For example, if you draw the keyboard and all of the icons, you can use that same piece of paper over and over, instead of re-drawing it each time.

Outside we play fetch with it and I can bounce it just like a tennis ball to get him excited about it. Plus it has a fun and unpredictable bounce--to keep him guessing. Since it is rubber-like, there is no lingering slobber and a quick rinse makes in indoor ready in seconds! Quite unlike those tennis balls that are banished forever to the back yard.Inside, I fill it with large sized kibble and some broken up jerky treats, and let him have at it without fear of hurting my hardwood floors cause it is super soft (unlike many treat balls).

However, things went terribly wrong when my child was overzealous in her enjoyment of the macarana setting. While spinning during the song is encouraged as part of the LeapFrog experience, she continued spinning long after the song had ended.Still spinning, Felicity inadvertently bumped into another button on the table, activating the trombone slide. The sudden, jarring change in volume level caused her to jump into the air--landing on the adjustable, plastic-molded legs. Felicity and the LeapFrog Learn and Groove table collapsed to the floor.Thankfully, she escaped major injury. After a couple of hours in the emergency room, my wife and I were relieved Felicity had only suffered a couple of cuts and bruises, in addition to a broken arm. Because of this, I am unable to recommend this product to other parents.",Kids_games
1108,"I must admit that I am a game adict and it is difficult to find games that everyone will agree to play. There are many drawing games that many will refuse to play because they think they ""can't draw"". A game that is super fun to play is ""Who, What, Where"", but since it is 5 minutes of actual drawing a picture, most people refuse to play. This is not a problem with this game, since it is doodling and fast paced, people will agree to doodle out their best interpretation of an object.In Oodles of Doodles, you select a card that has a subject matter on it. Now, there can be up to eight objects on the back of the card (sometimes less) and each drawing item fits into the clue on the front of the card. So, we are already starting off with an understanding of where the drawer is going. Then there is a whiteboard with 8 boxes for drawing 1 item in each box. For example, the card might say",Kids_games

1110,"A must have for all dog-lovers! Fresh n' Clean is an instant, effective and inexpensive tool for eliminating pet odor. I worked for a dog groomer for several years and have owned many pets. I have yet to see a product work better! I am not a fan of most pet scents or colognes, but I have a fond appreciation for Fresh n Clean products. My favorite scents are Baby Powder and Fresh Floral scent. In my opinion, this product is more like a deodorizer or deodorant than a cologne spray, because it seems to do a lot more than just ""cover-up"" odor. Jade (our Akita) always receives lots of compliments at the Dog Park from other Pet Owner's when she is wearing it. Everyone always thinks she has just had a bath. To me, that is the ultimate compliment!",Pet_care

My cats hated the ramp, peed on the rug and never ever used it (they enter from the side) so I tossed it, but it's just fine without ramp. While it is rather noisy when it rakes, the littermaid is a delight to have for a scooping service. It actually works quite well but you're still going to have to clean between the rakes to get the stuck poops out every now and then. Oh, and cleaning it is a nightmare, but still a million times better than dealing with a manual box. My cats love their littermaid especially because their litter is always nice and clean for the most part. Try to reuse the receptacles because they are a rip-off (hot sudsy water will do )and read the manual so you don't break the machine, and you will be glad you got it. Don't expect a miracle.

The overall concept sounded great, but the execution was lacking.

1133,"I just purchased this Leap Pad for my 4 year old son. We have 2 other leap pad systems, the My first leap pad and the original leap pad system. When I previously bought those systems for my son he was'nt ready to learn to write. Now however, he is old enough for this system and after a lot of attempts to get him to practice letters and practice writing his name I could'nt get him to really pay attention to me to write his letters, he would get bored and be ready to quit trying. I then decided on getting the Leap Pad System Plus Writing.When I went to purchase it, I saw the Leap Pad Plus Writing Plus Microphone System that also included 2 books. I could'nt find a price, so I picked it up and put it in the cart to see how much it cost, to my great surprise it was the same amount of money as the Leap Plus Writing. (I don't think any other store carries the Leap Pad Writing and Microphone system except Toys R Us) So I was even more pleased that it had an additional feature of the microphone.When I got home and opened it up for my son to start writing and playing with it, I was really surprised at how easy it was for him to hold the pencil stylus and he quickly traced the letters on the pages almost flawlessly! He loved it, he loved how the letters made sounds, for instance the letter I will say I-I-I-ICKY as you trace over it. He laughs each time a letter talks as he is tracing over them. Then we began playing with the microphone feature I never dreamed how much enjoyment he'd get out of this feature! It is a huge plus to have the microphone! One of the starter books that came with it has several pages that you can use the microphone on it, there is one page that you make a car sound and it uses your voice to sound like its starting the car on the page. Its really funny to get the sounds on the page with my son's voice. He laughs and giggles and it keeps him occupied for at least an hour at a time! Learning letters and learning to write has never been more fun until we bought this system. It is a WONDERFUL system and I can't say enough good things about it. If you are thinking of getting a leap pad for your child, go with the writing and microphone. If you think your child is not old enough yet for the writing feature, just take out the lead in the pencil. Another really great thing about the leap pad writing system, if you purchase any of the leap pad writing books they come with a new pencil with lead.Another thing about this system, its more compact than the original leap pad, its very sturdy and it also comes with an eraser storage pocket and an eraser for the writing books. I figured the pencil would have an eraser on the end of it, but they don't instead they made a big eraser, easier for smaller kids to erase off their pages to re use them or to correct thier mistakes and a handy storage pocket to keep your eraser handy at all times.Another thing I noticed about the system is the pencil stylus stays put once its snapped in the system, the other leap pads we have the stylus is hard to get to stay. They made this leap pad very durable and I agree with another reviewer- this is the ""cadallic of all leap pads!""This system is worth every penny I paid for it. My 4 year old is already mastering writing words and has learned to spell several new words because of this system. I am so pleased with this leap pad, I would highly reccommend it!!!",Kids_games

We called the manufacturer 1-888-ERGOSYS and spoke with SAMUEL email sam@ergosys.net who had us look at the timer (not the problem) and test the motor from which he determined that a power fluctuation caused the motor to strip the gears. WRONG! It's on a power protector because our pet's health is important to us! Even after speaking with his 'supervisor' the best they could offer is to sell us a replacement base for 20% off the $70+shipping+handling charge which is nearly the cost of a new unit. They don't sell the parts or do the refurbishment. ANY COMPANY THAT WOULD NOT HONOR A UNIT 2 WEEKS OUT OF WARRANTY IS SIMPLY NOT STANDING BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT.

It's interesting to me to see how she tries to get the noises to work on the pages (she is not strong enough yet) as she doesn't bang on the pages of her other books.I think the most important thing to remember when using this toy is that it is meant to be used as a tool to help parents read to their children, not as a subsitute for reading together.

But then, I read in The New Yorker magazine long ago that the creator of the ""First"" perfume is now working for Hermes Perfumes. Out of curiosity I wanted to try Van Cleef & Arpel's perfume. Just as Hermes is known for their Birkin bags and silk scarves, Van Cleef & Arpels brand has earned their name as one of the premiere jewelry designers. If Hermes stole away their perfume creator, then ""First"" must have been his work of art.Sure enough ""First"" is everything I have hoped for and more. It comes in elegant box, the bottle is breathtaking which makes it beautiful for display and for a present if you are intending it for someone else. But the scent is unmistakably unique, long lasting and essence of elegance. It is for mature women and not for casual wear. I do not beileve it would suit young women well. This perfume is all about sophistication, style and poise.Over the years I have been regular customer of Beauty Encounter. One can find great, genuine products on their web site at great prices, service is excellent and there is always free samples included with your purchases, for an even better satisfaction. This was a kind of purchase I do not regret and I look forward to in the future.",Perfumes

Very soft and cozy insert which is also washable. Love the privacy flaps with plenty of easy air circulation for them. Our fattest cat fit in easily with space to move around.

1205,"We purchased these dog beds because our Great Danes love lying out in the sunshine, wanting to be outside even when the ground is damp or snow covered and dissatisfied when they can't lie down. Regular dog beds become damp and dirty, especially when removed from the concrete and dragged round the garden. Using the Coolaroo meant that their beds could be kept off the ground most of the time. Having encountered rattlesnakes warming themselves on the concrete on a couple of occasions, the fact that the dogs can relax off the ground provides some reassurance.I didn't find the assembly as easy as I had hoped, I needed another couple of hands to hold things straight and you need to make sure the feet are the right way round in order to insert the screws in the more concave surface. I'm not sure if I missed this instruction or if it wasn't there.The dogs took a little while to get used to stepping up onto the beds and were initially worried by the flexing of the surface, but they seem to have mastered the technique now. Leggy, short haired dogs like Danes rub their fur off and get callouses easily on hard surfaces so the Coolaroo provides a good solution to this problem.",Pet_care

The bark collar stopped the barking immediately and, I was happy to find, it also works to stop her from crying loudly. She has also stopped clawing and snorting at the crack under the door. She seems a little more subdued than I would like, but still, it's such a blessing to know I can leave and my neighbors won't be glowering at me when I return home. I don't use it on our walks because I respect her ""right to bark"". I've been squirted by the collar a couple of times when cuddling her and chirping ""good dog"" in her ear.

The first box I bought was just a cheap plastic box. No matter what litter I bought, it was a pain in the neck to clean, not to mention disgusting! I hated searching through the litter for any small clumps, it smelled, and it was a huge waste of litter. I saw this litter box online when I was searching for something better. I did a lot of research, but the only boxes comparable to the function were the $100-200 automatic boxes. I wasn't interesterested in paying that much for something that my cat was just going to use the bathroom in!! I had my doubts, but knew with Amazon's easy return policy that it was worth a shot.I received the package quickly, set it up, and waited. My cat used it, no problem, and the high opening and covered box help keep the litter and smell in. I rolled the box just as instructed. It worked great!! The only two problems I have are, one, the urine clumps still stick to the bottom, so I have to scrape them loose, then roll. Two, I was unsure of the size, so I bought a large. I should have bought a small or medium!! The large is huge! It takes up a lot of space! And you have to leave room to roll it! Other than that, there is no way I would go back to a regular box again!

I hated to even leave the house!I actually bought two of these and wanted to share with you what I think went wrong with the first one since some reviewers are having problems with it not working. I had the first one for about a week. Everything was great--the results were immediate. And then, suddenly, it stopped working. Of course I no longer had the receipt, so I couldn't return it to the pet shop where I bought it (btw, do purchase it online because at a pet store it costs almost twice as much). Out of desperation, I decided to try again with another one. When I was filling it, some spray was coming out, making me think that it was full. But then I saw in the directions that you cannot overfill it and, when more pressure was applied, the citronella spray didn't sputter out. On a whim I went back to the old one, which I still had. Sure enough, I filled it as per the instructions and it worked. Basically, I wasn't putting enough spray in when I thought I was overfilling it.Also, for those worried about whether this causes stress for the dog, I can tell you that in my case I think it really lessened my dog's stress. When I left him alone he would not only bark, but he would also tear the place apart, getting into trash cans, etc. I think the collar really helps because it gets his attention and stops him from working himself up into a frenzy. Of course, you still need to exercise your animal and desensitize him to your leaving, but this collar is really a great supplement to that training if you have a constant problem with barking.

We filled the cube with a combination of his normal dry food and a few delicious treats to entice him to keep using it. It took him a few hours to really get the hang of it - I had to show him a few times by batting it around but he quickly caught on to the fact that there is food inside. He uses it every day now like a pro. As some reviewers have mentioned this thing is INCREDIBLY loud if you have hard floors - he also bangs it into walls and doors on occasion which makes a real racket. I would recommend it for carpet only. Overall this is a great toy for keeping your dog occupied and make him work, especially when you're not home.",Pet_care

1257,"I wanted the Adventure Team ""Secret Agent"" set as a kid, but only got the cheap ""Undercover Agent"" (not to be confused with this) instead. I was excited to see that they did a repro revival of it. The set comes with a Man of Action style figure (honestly, the only one that the mask really works with). The only piece of equipment missing from the classic set is the revolver/shoulder holster combo. However, they added classic look fragmentation grenades (something that was phased out of the GI Joe line after 1968), binoculars, K-BAR knife/scabbard, flashlight, and map/mapcase. The real reason to get this is theFrom Russia with Love [Blu-ray]inspired briefcase that includes the modified Luger p-08 and a small wiretap recorder. The P-08, with its removable stock and silenced barrel extension draws its inspiration from the AR-7 inFrom Russia with Love [Blu-ray] andGoldfinger [Blu-ray], as well as the modified Walther-P-38 fromThe Man from U.N.C.L.E.",Kids_games

During your turn you will answer 1 of 4 question types. Where you land on the board (and you can strategically decide where to land) determines what type of question you will answer. The Teaser category challenges you to find the relationship; the Odd-1-Out category asks you to decide which item, term, person or place does not belong; the Sequence category asks you to put everything imaginable into sequences; and the Wild Card Category mixes different types of challenges, such as naming famous songs, identifying famous quotes, etc..

There isn't nearly enough variety making the game very repetative. Second, some of the cards are miss printed so that the answers don't match the questions. Third, the board was not designed correctly. Like Trivial Pursuit you have to acquire five colors which are red, yellow, purple, green and blue. Every space on the board has a Disney picture outlined in the color of the question to be asked. The problem is, there is no blue outlined spaces on the board. This means you can never be asked a &quot;Blue&quot; question, and you can never acquire the five colors to win the game. I was very dissapointed in this shotty product.

This is designed for people who want a messy or semi-messy look (messy but look fixed) where you only use your hands and fingers. In that case, it has superb hold. It does remain somewhat sticky and stays that way the whole day. It gives a semi-glossy look that looks a little wet. It actually works best when your hair is completely dry or a bit wet.

It truly is wonderful.The scent is quite strong however. I personally really like the scent but it is strong and could conflict with colognes.Try it at night after your shower, before bed, and you will feel the soft effects all day the following day.

1335,"I would have recommended this fountain whole-heartedly when we first purchased it. Our 84 lb shepherd/malamute mix prefers running water, and he loved this fountain. All was wonderful until we introduced a GSD puppy into our home. Around the time she was 3 months old, she started taking the cover off of the filter housing and chewing it up and then taking out the filters and chewing them apart. Even replacing the cover and filters, it still happened. One day I noticed the spout where the water comes out was getting chewed up. Then, she decided she liked to 'play' in the water while we were at work. She started splashing the water out of the bowl with her paws. Along with trying to train her not to, we purchased the tray to go underneath to catch the water. Then one day she splashed all of the water out onto the floor, emptying the reservoir's water onto my kitchen floor. When I arrived home, the fountain was unplugged, drained completely empty, on the opposite side of the kitchen from where it started, and the bottle reservoir was nowhere to be found. I finally located it outside, under the bushes, chewed up (they'd carried it out through the doggy door). I reassembled it, and it was still functional, but the water on the floor had seeped under the cabinets into the dining area and ruined my laminate wood flooring. This could have happened with any refilling water bowl, and I don't blame the manufacturer, but it meant the end of this fountain for my household. I couldn't afford any more damage to my home, and to risk the dogs going without water all day because of her 'playing'. We researched for a week and ended up buying aDog It Fresh and Clear Large Dog Fountain - Dog It 73651water fountain. The filters are completely hidden and internal, the water 'hole' is high off of the ground and difficult to reach with playful paws, and it seems like it would be nearly impossible for the dogs to disassemble it the way they did the big dog fountain. So far this has been a solution for our 'problem' pup.I'm still giving this fountain a good rating. It is easy to clean, relatively quiet and relaxing sounding, and my dogs loved it- had we not gotten the second dog and gone through the puppy phase with this fountain, I'm sure it would have lasted a very long time. The first dog never chewed on it or splashed. And even when we started having to replace parts on it because of the chewing, the parts were readily available and reasonably priced (some on Amazon, some on the manufacturers website).If you have well behaved dogs, I think this fountain is great. But if you have destructo-playful Marley pups, it can be an expensive item to end up in your garage.",Pet_care

He has used it for almost 6 months and is very happy. He says that he notices less hair falling out in the shower, on his pillow, and on his shirts.

Short of suspecting the manufacturer with coating the toy with come kind of skin-contact narcotic, I believe that this is an ideal gift for toddlers.Nevertheless, I see an awful lot of the later versions of this toy (meant for slightly older children) at the secondary level stores such as Marshalls for more than half off as well as in thrift stores for around $10 still ""new-in-box"" so perhaps it's really only good for children that still aren't capable of forming coherent sentences (much less words).",Kids_games
1355,"I have two cats, the little one is just over a year old and the princess, who is about 3-4 years of age. Well the little one decided that she needs to knock over anything with water, glasses, bowls, you name it. We tried the ""untippable"" bowls, but she still managed to put all her weight on it to make the water bowl flip. Every night I would come home from work and there would be water all over the floor and the cats meowing... So finally my wife and I decided let's get a pet fountain and see if that does the trick. Once it arrived the cats knew who the fountain was for, it's amazing how they have that sense when something is for them (then again they have that sense when things are not for them too!) They stood and stared at the water fountain for a good hour or two after it was all set up. The little one took to it quick and started drinking from it. The princess would not stand for change and refused to drink (even obligating to drink from the toilet). I was confused as to why she would do such a thing because ever since she was little she drank out of the bathtub after everytime someone showered... Anyways, I made sure the fountain was the only source of water available to them in hopes the princess would change, and eventually she did, and doesn't mind drinking from the fountain at all. Although, she acts like she is doing something bad everytime she is drinking and is always tense. The little one just sits there and drinks water all day. I have had this fountain for 6 months, and I have to say, no more tipped over bowls and my cats are probably drinking better water than before. There are some negative aspects, if you don't fill it, the motor starts making some weird noise. Also make sure to clean it if it makes any noise too.

1359,"I have the kind of hair that if not dealt with straight out of the shower, it will dry into a frizzy, wavy, unattractive mess. I hate it at all costs. But then I discovered this stuff, tried it, and love it! I have been using it for over 3 years now. I simply apply it to my lightly towel-dried, but still damp hair and then put my hair in a ponytail, and let it air dry as much as it can. Of course, it ends up drying the most when I go to bed and take the ponytail out.The next morning, my hair is frizz free, soft, and manageable. Usually, at this point, I'll run a straightener through my hair with no other ingredients added, and it does wonders. No product build up by avoiding other products, and it's soft and manageable enough that you don't even need other products. My hair will remain straight for a good 3 days before I need to wash it again from oil buildup.The other way I style it, is after applying this after a shower, I apply the Giovanni sunset styling lotion. I let this air dry too, and it dries really fast (definitely within 30 minutes). and I have really crunchy curls and no frizz. I tend to prefer how this looks on me the following day as the curls loosen more and the product loosens up; it ends up looking like I have beachy waves hair.Totally recommend both products, but if I could live with one for the rest of my life, it would be the vitapro fusion.

And it seems to get a full charge in about an hour (much less than the two hours the manual says it takes).Once charged, I set it on the floor and throttled up. It came up off the ground but went into a bad spin and I had to set it down. After a few minutes of adjusting the knob I honed it to the point where it would take off and land with great stability!

1409,"I've used it for about a year. It's the only product that's completely cleared my face up. I never even considered myself having severe acne, but I always had something or other in some place or another. Everything I tried never got rid of *all* of it.What I don't like? It's four steps. Thats a lot of time, many nights I forget to use the last step (to use 10 mins after the toner). I'm not very consistent with using it, which is probably why other things never really worked that well. But it cleared up my acne, if I become too inconstant (not using it at least once a day) acne will pop back up. If I start using it consistently again the acne will clear up pretty fast.I always considered my skin normal, not very oily or dry. My skin never became very dry because of this product. If my skin ever becomes very dry though, I'm pretty quick to apply another lotion to it.Over all though, it works. It works really good. Even when I say screw it and don't follows all of it's rules is still works pretty well. Not prefect, if you don't do everything, but still better than the rest if your inconsistent.",Hair_products

1419,"I purchased the Drinkwell Platinum a few months ago and my cats love it. My 3-year old Kadin always drank from the falling stream of water, while my 11-year old Tish drinks from the bowl below. They both drank way more water than they did before, as evidenced in the litter box.I believe the fountain helped Kadin, but alas couldn't stop the blockage building in his bladder- we had to put him down 11/30/08. I think a combination of purchasing this fountain earlier and feeding him different food would've prevented this tragedy.The fountain holds a ton of water. With 2 cats drinking from it in a dry apartment in winter, I didn't have to refill it for about 1 1/2 weeks. The filters last about a month if you rinse it thoroughly 2 weeks in. The design of the new filters, where it segmented so the carbon doesn't settle to the bottom, helps their longevity.I take the whole fountain apart once a month and clean it up with a teeny tiny bit of dish soap. Its very easy to disassemble and reassemble, even the pump is easy. The brush kit that is designed for the fountain is a great convenience, it saves a lot of time and hassle fighting with cleaning tools that don't quite fit or bend right. To unplug, disassemble, clean, reassemble, and refill takes at most 10 minutes, and that's if the cat's playing with the cord and making things difficult. :)I found that cleaning is even easier if you have soft water. The tap water here is VERY hard (and tastes like a swimming pool), so I use the gallon jugs full of filtered water from the grocery store. Its $.80 for the first jug, and $.25 to refill the jug.Of course, now that we're down to one cat I can go a little longer between refills and cleanings.I was so impressed by this product I bought one for my best friend for Christmas. Her kitty had bladder problems too, and he loves to both drink and play in it. She saw the same results in her litter box that I did in mine. I highly recommend this fountain to anyone who owns a cat, and especially anyone who owns a male cat to help avoid bladder and urinary issues.",Pet_care

1430,"Ah the controversial Swheat scoops litter! Does it breed bugs? Does it stick to the bottom of litter boxes? Do pets gorge themselves on it? You won't know until you try it in your home with your animals. However, know this... One of my cats love sleeping in it! Ok now that I have your attention, keep reading.From my own trial and error instead of reading the instructions, Swheat Scoops likes to be used with a deep layer of about five or six inches or so in a normal box. Otherwise, you get that odoriferous oatmeal cookie dough consistency stuck to the bottom of your litter box.The Litter Robot II doesn't work well with Swheat Scoops litter. Unlike a conventional litter box, you can't simply add more than the recommended litter to the Litter Robot II. If you add too much litter, the excess gets dumped into the waste receptacle. And there in lies the problem. Since the litter isn't deep enough, the cookie dough sticks to the flexible rubber bottom of the globe! The cookie dough sticks so well to the rubber, that when the rubber flops out when the globe is fully inverted, the cookie dough won't let go! That's sticky... and Stinky too.So folks with normal boxes, double up the depth and you'll be fine. People with Litter Robot II's, don't use it or you'll end up taking a litter scoop to your globe. Quite ironic since didn't you want to stop using a litter scoop when you got your Litter Robot II? Also, I noticed that my normal litter scooper didn't sift the excess swheat scoops too well. It felt like I was tossing out a lot of the good with the bad. So maybe a scoop upgrade is necessary too.",Pet_care

Be careful to make sure you follow the directions, overheating the gel will cause the outer plastic casing to bubble up and then you'll have to throw it away.

I do caution you that these stairs are hard to put together.

I hose the litter pan and rake down every month or so and when its dry, I spray it with 2 coats of SILICONE SPRAY to decrease muddy litter patches. !!Spray anything that touches the litter!!I hate cleaning the litter box, but partial scooping every 1-2 days is better than daily changes, any day of the week.

There are no unpleasant tones to this cologne and it seems to last a while. The bottle is stylish and very tall compared to all of my other ones, but the box is pretty plain.

1503,"And I say it as an expert on just about any product that promises to reduce pet hair shedding, or make the clean up of it easier.I have a Norwegian Elkhound, one very compact, highly intelligent, gorgeous and HAIRY dog. She has both a long coat and a very prolific downy white undercoat that seemingly sheds 24/7. It's got a cotton ball texture; tufts of it stick out, and if you pull it, you get a pouf of very soft white down that is guaranteed to stick to you and everything in its path.My former regimen was to use a rubber curry brush for the long outer coat, and (the part I hate), an undercoat rake. No matter how much I brush her, I'm covered with hair, and there's a grocery bag FULL of hair. It's an hour to two hour task, and as much as I love my dog, a huge, hairy nuisance!When I got the Furminator, I was impressed with the heft of it. I bought the large size with the idea that it'd be that much less effort (generally speaking, the small size is the cheapest, but it's so small, it would take forever on anything but the smallest or unhairiest dog. And the difference in price between the medium and large is, at most places, only a few bucks. If you're going to invest in the furminator, go for the size that makes the most out of every pass over the dog's coat.)So I tried a few swoops on the dog. And yeah, it resulted in a ton of hair, but if I just run my fingers through her coat, I get pretty much the same result.I got a grocery bag (to store the hair pulled off the comb) and set to work. On the initial combing, it took a little less than the usual hour it does. What was interesting, though, is that I used only the Furminator, not the undercoat rake and curry comb combo I usually use. In that sense, it was less time and effort.The bag, as usual, was full. But the thing that really sold me on the Furminator is how good her coat looked. Very professional looking, like she had just gotten back from the groomer's.Now it's a few days later, and lo and behold, one of the promises the maker of the Furminator made seems to actually be true",Pet_care

He is on a CD diet to discourage the development of crystals blocking his urethra (he was hospitalized in a harrowing incident a few years ago, so we are loath to switch his food), would not put up with injections from us, and is almost pathologically resistant to leaving the house. I decided to try Synflex despite a strong skepticism that it would work for him. I've been happily proved to have made the right choice. While he's not tremendously fond of the taste, he will eat Synflex on his food. His appetite has returned, his mood has improved, his ability to jump has rebounded to an extent (he always makes it up onto the bed on the first try again, though he still takes the toilet lid route to the bathroom counter). His gait is much smoother, and he's taken to enjoying the rips again through the house, including several cat flaps. He can race down stairs again instead of bobbing slowly down one tread at a time. We noticed some improvement after just a few days of taking the supplement but tamped our hopes down to avoid the later disappointment of wishful thinking.

Our dog, Oscar, loves frozen Kongs, the Busy Body Squirrel, as well as the Bob-a-Lot and Kong Wobbler (basically anything that makes him work a little to get his food). However, he did not like this toy at all.We use the other toys to get him to slow down as he eats. Oscar is a 9-month old Laborador Retriever, and since he was about 4 months old he has scarfed his food down in seconds (only to become bored very quickly after). So very early we began to explore ways to make feeding time fun and a little challenging for him.We filled the Tricky Treat Ball with his food, just like the other treats, and put it on the floor and waited for him to seize upon the new toy (like he does with other treat systems). Instead he pushed it and then ignored it.The problem is that the food/treats do not reliably dispense-- it is basically a ball with a very long cylindrical piece attached to the entry (like a long tube that goes down into the ball). The dog really would have to turn this over and over and over to get treats to roll out. It has no weighting to it (like the Kong Wobbler or the Bob-a-Lot), so it just kind of randomly works. I think it makes it less of a 'puzzle' to figure out as the dispensing pattern is infrequent and random (and most often actions result in 'no treat' delivered).Hope this review helps. I do see a lot of dogs like this, so it may have to do with how your dog is used to 'working' for treats.Woof!",Pet_care

How can a little puppy do that? Who knows what could she could have done had I been a little longer. Puppies need to be protected from themselves at that age.

1553,"I purchased one of these back in 06/2007 and was ecstatic about it and so was my little girls and they still are. It is still going strong with few problems except that the material that it's made with is cheap not to mention plastic. I remedied most of the problems that others had mentioned in their reviews. The product is truly phenomenal in its design. I contacted the company who make these items back in 2007 with an excellent idea as to how they could make millions if only they would construct them out of ""Stainless Steele""! Following is an insert from the email that I sent to them, and they decided to ignore, ""Their Bad"".""Overall I love the product because my pets just love the continuous flow of fresh water, too bad you don't have it in Stainless Steel. Many people won't give their pets anything to eat or drink out of plastic containers. I was really hesitant myself because I don't usually give food or water out of plastic because it isn't good for animals. Foods have acids and other ingredients in it that interact with plastic and hard water, which I have, also reacts with the plastic. The minerals in the hard water corrodes the plastic and wear it out in certain areas. If you made this product out of Stainless Steel you would most likely have twice the customers you have now using it! This is ""FYI"" on what true Pet Lovers buy for their Pets. I only use ceramics or Stainless Steel containers to feed my Pets in. Not only does Stainless Steel last longer but it doesn't interact with food or water.""I have just recently discovered on Amazon.com that they sell another brand from a different manufacturerPioneer Fountain Big Max- Stainless Steelthat's made out of ""Stainless Steele"", but it's design isn't anywhere close to the design of the Auto-Pet Waterer (because it doesn't have a reservoir)from(Ergosys), old name, now the name is different with a slightly different design but they're the same right down to the plastic construction! Plastic isn't good for your pets food or water. Plastic is hard to sanitize properly. I've always fed my Poms' out of Stainless Steele Bowls. I ordered my new bowls(2) on 06/30/2011 and was supposed to have received them yesterday by FedEx according to FedExs' delivery reporting them as being delivered, but obviously FedEx delivered them to the wrong address and I'll have to wait until after the 4th of July before I get them! I was very disappointed because I wanted to introduce my cats and poms to them on the 4th of July. If only Pioneer Pets would make one similar to this plastic one by Ergo with the reservoir, they would make $millions. As stated earlier the plastic model cost too much to be made out of plastic. I can't review the new bowls from Pioneer Pets because I haven't had a chance to use them yet, but when I've had the chance I'll do a follow-up.",Pet_care

1559,"This is a great game of kingdom building that is easy to learn and very fun to play. The games are relatively short (30 to 45 minutes)so it doesn't take an entire evening, either.Players take turns drawing land tiles and placing them on the board. Tiles have various structures (e.g. roads, cities, fields) on them that need to be matched up for proper placement. You can't have a road end in an open field, it must be attached to another road.Each player has a number of followers to dispatch throughout the kingdom. They can be placed on roads (to become thieves), cities (to become knights), monistaries (to become monks), or fields (to become farmers). Once a structure is completed (roads have two ending points or intersections, cities are completely walled in, etc.) the player scores points for his follower and may remove to follower from the board to place him on a subsequent round.This game is a good way to learn resource management. If you place all of your followers you won't have any in reserve for a prime opportunity, should it arise later. Is it better to get quick points with roads or small cities, or try to keep extending the roads and cities for greater scores? There are many strategies to consider and options to contemplate. Yet, this game is easy to learn in a few minutes. And since the players place the board pieces there are no two game boards alike.My friends and I have had hours of entertainment from this game.

1573,"Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot is a card game developed by Jeffrey Neil Bellinger and published by Playroom Entertainment. Some praise the game for its smart mechanics while others criticize the randomness. Differing opinions aside, Killer Bunnies is the game that got me into gaming. A few years ago I'd be happy to challenge you to a round of Apples to Apples or Imaginiff. Now I'm ready to team up and save the world in Pandemic.Killer Bunnies is more complicated than your typical card game. But I've taught over 20 people and everyone's picked it up within a few rounds. The instructions are written extremely well, but I can understand someone getting overwhelmed on a first read (particularly because I was one of those people).There are 12 Carrot Cards in the game. The main objective is to collect them. Once the last Carrot Card is drawn, the game is over, and one of those carrots is randomly selected as the winner. The more carrots you have, the higher your chances are of being the winner. This is a primary complaint that some people have with the game. ""In the end, the game is just a lottery."" To that I say:Yep.But strategy is also important. The secondary objective is to have as many bunnies out on the table as possible while simultaneously killing your opponents' bunnies. If the final Carrot Card is drawn and you have no bunny, all your carrots are forfeited and you have no chance of winning. Without strategy early on, you can't enter the lottery.Because of this, Killer Bunnies is a great example of harmony between chance and strategy. Everyone competes until the very end, as opposed to other games in which a single player dominates and no one has a chance to take them down. As long as you have a one bunny and a one carrot, you can win.The game allows for trading, which leads to additional layers of strategy (read",Kids_games

1590,"First of all let me say that I have seen worse.This castle is about the quality of any of the mattel Barbie houses.We all know that when something needs to be assembled and pieces popped into place that sooner or later they will come off and have to be snapped back on,that's just the way it is.Secondly and most importantly(judging from most other reviews)the dreaded stickers.Yes there are quiet a few,however there are only 3 shapes-heart,star and circle.The good news about them is that they are made of the thicker silver holagram type material,so if a corner accidently sticks before you have centered it perfectly you can lift it back up w/out tearing the sticker.They are small and it is time consumeing(took me about 35 minutes) but there is a guide and the stickers are grouped into numbered cattagories.Assembly is also pretty basic and only took a few minutes.As for the hot air balloon, come on now.How many beach balls have you ever inflated that stayed inflated forever?That one is a given.I will say that the crown that comes with it is just plain crap!It is made of a rubbery sort of plastic and does not stay together well at all,but it really does not detract or add to the castle one way or the other.The turrets(balconies for balloon and crown) to me seem allright.They each have grooved sides that easily slide into place.I just love the music that is activated w/a pony.It plays the old MLP theme song.Some of the things that could have been better are the elevator(You just move it up and down w/your hand it could have had a handle or something to turn for movement),I also do not like the design of the spinnig dance wheel.All it is is a piece of round plastic w/a magnet to hold the pony on.It fits into a hole on the stage and you also just turn this w/your hand.Also when you place it on the stage it covers up the magnet that activates the music and lights.It would have been nice if it turned with the music.A carrying handle also would have been nice but over all I am not as disappointed as I thought I might be and for the sale price of 19.99 I think it is worth it.",Kids_games

1599,"I have to admit, I wasn't too thrilled when I first looked at this one. &quot;Great, another silly space-war game&quot; I thought. But once we started playing, my opinion changed. The original Risk is a classic, but even the old favorites can get a little stale after a while. This 23rd century version is still the classic &quot;conquer the world&quot; game, but with enough new twists to make it seem like a whole new game. The most obvious difference is the new look of the game board. Continents have shifted around a bit, all the territory names have been updated (oh, how I miss Kamchatka in the springtime...), and there are now underwater territories. There's also a second smaller gameboard representing Moon-based territories. The Roman numeral unit makers are now MODs, little robotic looking battle drones of varying sizes. As for the gameplay, its the same basic deploy and attack, but now there are also special command units to work with. For example, you need to buy a Naval Commander if you want to attack underwater, and you can't get to the Moon without both a Space commander and a space station. Lose either of those, and your lunar troops are cut off until you replace them. You also accumulate power points, which you can redeem for Commanders, stations, special-function cards or to buy a specific place in the turn order. The cards are the best new feature of the game, adding alot of variety to the gameplay, and setting the stage for amazing shifts in the direction of the game. Say your opponant has Asia locked up, and you're really tired of him getting those extra 7 units each turn. If you've purchsed the Nuke Commander, you can use your power units to buy Nuke cards. Draw the right one, and you can nuke the whole continent, removing one of his units from *every territory*!. Careful, though. Nuke the wrong continent (determined by a die roll when you play the card) and you could nuke yourself! (Ask Ray, he knows!) Another nice touch is the status board, a grid numbered 1 to 70. Each player puts a unit on the board, in the box showing the number of territories owned. As battles are resolved, the winner's marker moves up and the loser's moves down, making it very easy to keep track of territory counts. &quot;Risk 2210 A.D.&quot; has enough new features to draw a whole new set of fans, but is enough like the classic to satisfy the old-timers. Overall, a worthy successor to an all-time classic.",Kids_games

It keeps her busy, does a number on her teeth, and is just generally a great time-waster all around.

1610,"I received this as a baby shower gift and attached it to my son's carrier/carseat when he was about 1 month old and it has not come off since! He is not almost 6 months and still loves it. It does tend to get in the way a little when I am putting him in his seat or taking him out, but with I am okay with that because it keeps him so happy. When he was about 6 weeks old he decided that he hated his carseat. That's when I put this on it and ever since he has loved it. He used to love the music (because he was too little to do much with the toys). But now he will spend forever playing with the little fish and star sliding them back and forth. We still play the music occasionally when he gets fussy.I love this and would reccomend it to everyone. In fact, three other new moms I know with babies under 6 months of age have gone and purchased this after seeing how much my son loves it!",Kids_games
1611,"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.",Pet_care

1652,"We bought an older version of this recently at a consignment sale. My son Adores this toy. The train is super sturdy and moves well on both carpet and hard flooring. The animals are large and easy to handle. They are interactive in different ways. Most of them make a ratchety noise when you move the legs, the lion has a rattle in his mane and it spins, the alligator squeaks, the panda has rattles in his feet. the hippo's mouth opens etc... As I said, we bought this used and it came with many other animals, and I have since found more to add to our collection as well so we have many more than come with the toy originally. I would say they are pretty easy to find if you wanted to do the same. In addition to being easy to handle, they are also very durable. My son has dropped/ thrown them on hard floors many times. No damage done to the toy. Our version of the train sings a couple different songs when activated, and while catchy and informative, good for learning about animal characteristics, they get old after the 57th time.... LOL We found ourselves talking back to the nice woman singing them... The whistle next to the smokestack plays different animal sounds also. We found that if you accidentaly start the song, if you press the whistle and it cuts it off with an animal noise. Overall, its a great toy. It has stood up to our son standing on it, trying to ride it and generally playing like little boys do, and its no worse for wear, and ours is an older version anyways....

My dog had a thick doublecoat and I was concerned about being able to comb through to get fleas since combing himwould result in a comb full of the undercoat hairs no matter how much he was brushed prior.This is a review of Safari Flea Comb for Dogs with wood handle.This flea comb seems to have a bigger space between the teeth, and didn't remove fleasas easily as other combs. Also it rusted fast within the first week of use.I used the comb along with bathing of my dog since with wet fur it was easier to spotthe red-brown fleas or Dog Flea ( Ctenocephalides canis ) that are more flat with fatrears. Dog fleas' strategy was to grip the fur and stay on,making me have to comb several times on the flea to try to dislodge it, Sometimes the fleawas very good and scraping and combing the flea would take awhile to get it loose.Also, this comb isn't very useful for Cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) since thosecat fleas have smaller black bodies that are narrow and easily crawl out of the teeth tohop away if I didn't thrust my comb into soapy water fast enough, and yes I tried to getthem in the soap water asap, into a separate bowl. Fleas are sneaky and like to crawlup the dog to air if the dog is sitting in water, soap water also makes it harder forthe black colored Cat Flea to use its wings for a big hop away escape.Bottom line is this comb was a big disappointment and waste of money.The best comb that I wish I had and knew about years ago was an all metal flea comb[[ASIN",Hair_products

It does not specify the size, but great that they say it's 100% natural.So, it smells bad and looks very small, but my dog loves it! Maybe it's just small for my 100 lbs Cane Corso... On the back of the pack it says to give 2-3 stix a day for dogs that size. Each stick is about 5 in long and 1/2 in diameter. They are very hard, but my dog does not have any problems chewing it. It goes away in about 1 min. When he fells that he is going to get it, he starts ""dancing"".I cannot say anything about its function, my dog only got stix few times.

It arrived quickly and in excellent condition (no leaking). I find the scent to be pleasant - citrus, clean, and fresh, but not very strong.

It was getting progressivly worse, and eventually got to the point where I was cleaning up messes at least once per day. She would use the litterbox sometimes, and other times go right next to or in front of it. I had her checked out for health issues, and my vet said she was fine, and to try this litter and get a second litter box.I kept one litterbox with their old litter, and one new one with this Cat Attract litter. My male cat used the Cat Attract right away, but my female cat used the old litter for the first day. The next day, she was using the new Cat Attract litter. It's been about a week now, and my female cat is now using the new Cat Attract consistenly, and actually burying everything after she goes too! (Before she would not bury anything) I also like the litter itself, clumps well, low dust and pretty good odor control. Both cats now use the new litter, but I still keep the old litter in the second box, so there is always a clean litterbox just in case. This Cat Attract is such a life saver! I'm happy, my cats are happy, and I can stop thinking about having to keep her confined to a small space, or taking her to a shelter. It might not work for everyone, but definetely worth trying if you have a cat with litterbox issues - just give it a day or two to start working.",Pet_care

1691,"We purchased this litter box approximatley 2 weeks ago from PetSmart. For the first couple of days, this item worked perfectly. However, over the following days, I noticed that the green light was not on intermittently. I checked and checked the top/lid and eventualy the light would come back on.One thing I did not like about this litterbox during the next twoo weeks, is the area the cat has to do its ""duty"" is very small, and many times, they would leave their ""presents"" on the lid of the unit, which defeats the purpose of this item.The last time I changed out the litter, which was three days ago, the light was on after I was finished. I noticed today that the green light was not on again, and looked as if it had only been on for a few hours after the cleaning by the contents of the ""bucket"" in the rear. I took the top off, checked to make sure everything it was where it should be, but no matter what I did, the green light would not come on. I disassembled the unit, and put it back together, still no green light.I called PetSafe to discuss this item with them, and they advised me since I did not have the receipt from PetSmart, that they could not help me. I also advised them that I had just tripped over the unit, and caught my foot on the edge of the unit, where tangs hang over and out from the product, and cut my foot approximately 1"" and it did bleed. I advised the I really hoped that my foot did not get infected since it was cut on a sharp point protruding from the bowl that is used by cats to urniate in and deficate in (although I did scrub it, and apply antibiotic to it). I did not get a response. I then asked to speak to a supervisor, and was put on hold. After approximately two minutes, I was told that all supervisors were in a meeting. How convenient.Poor quality product, and poor customer service. I am out of over $100.00 in two weeks time.

1694,"These walkie talkie thingys are SO fun! They're easy to play with... I rated the durability 3 stars because on one of mine the batteries already ran out but they only take 3 AAA batteries. One problem with it is that I think it's for kids a little bit younger than me because the head set is kinda small and it's not ajustable (only the part you look into is ajustable) and when I'm playing with it with my sister, I always end up taking the part you look into off of the headset and just look at it while holding it up to my eyeball. My sister just keeps it on and complains about it hurting. I think the key-pad is easier to use if you don't strap it to your arm, but my sister says it's easier when you DO strap it to your arm. I'm weird so just go with my sister... strap it to your arm. Overall, this thing is pretty fun... even though I'm a girl and people might think this is just for boys, it's still real fun...

Collectors versions can be great, but are very expensive. Now, Art Asylum has produced a plastic toy that is full-size, extremely faithful to the original prop, and very well engineered. The phaser 1 detaches and reattaches to the phaser 2 body very securely. The sounds are reasonably faithful to the original, although they could be a bit louder. The emitter in front has some nice light effects. Yes, this is a toy, and only plastic. It is not collector quality. But for the price, it's very cool.

I would much rather have seen them include a display stand as exciting as the Millenium Falcon ramp that came with Han Solo Unleashed, or perhaps part of the Death Star Detention Block when the ""captive"" Chewbacca breaks out of his shackles and ""unleashes"" on the Imperial officers, or when Chewie ""unleahes"" his wrath on Lando for selling out Han and choking him to his knees. Even a Trash Compactor base would have been more exciting then this, but then again, the latest wave of Unleashed figures is not exactly the best they've done to date.

1703,"We've got 6 cats, and bought one of these Littermaid boxes about two years ago. With this many cats, it doesn't take long for the box to jam up, and require manual scraping. It seems as if two cats use it in a row, before it has a chance to scrape after the first cat, you have a guaranteed jam.The box is very sensitive to the amount of litter you put in - just a touch too much and it won't be able to complete the sweep, and will keep trying over and over, annoying you to no end. Not enough litter and you have a hard mess to scrape off the plastic bottom.Maybe they should be lining these with some kind of teflon like a frying-pan has! We always keep a 4&quot; scraper next to the box and need to use it daily. What fun to clean out the &quot;teeth&quot; of the litter comb when the cat potties on them.The first box we had lasted just over a year before it's motor died.We replaced that one, reluctantly, with another by Littermaid, and now after about 7 months, somehow it managed to grab the wire in the &quot;teeth&quot; that provides power to the moving comb and when it got to the end to dump, it snapped the wire in half and stopped. For Good...I can fix darn-near anything, so I disassembled it with intentions of rewiring this part, but it seems they are using some special &quot;extra flexible&quot; wire that cannot be found at Home Depot or Radio Shack. They have this cheezy way of providing a retracting action of the wire with some spring steel and some plastic wheels.Anyway, now I have a second &quot;dead&quot; littermaid unit, and will likely have to buy yet a third one, since nobody else makes an automatic litterbox.

The feet unlock in seconds making it a great floor toy as well! The only thing I would fix on this toy is to make the feet not be able to skid on the floor. I have to put it up against something to make it not move as the babies that are just learning to stand and are leaning on it tend to lean and push their weight on it so it slowly, eventually, moves away from them and they fall if they are not closely watched. But they do all love it! And it has the Spanish feature which is SO great here in Albuquerque, New Mexico. They hear words in their own language and it encourages them to learn new words.

1711,"This game is a cute boardgame geared towards preschool age and early elementary school aged princesses. Boys need not play. They definitely won't want too with the Princess movers, princess references (the game really feeds into the princess craze!), and bright pink box. The game includes a game board, thick cardboard matresses (the real user pictures appear to have plastic beds, but this is not the case), 4 cardboard princess movers with little stands, and a spinner. Assembly is minimal. The object of the game is to get the most mattresses and become the true princess. The game requires some reading. My 5 year old reads, but my 3.5 year old does not. Both can play though with the reader helping the 3.5 year old. The concept is actually pretty simple, so children younger than the 5+ can play with reading assistance. The game is quick too, which is good for short attention spans.The main flaw is the movers. They are one sided. All of the stands are purple and all of the backs are hot pink. In order to easily keep track of which mover is which, the movers must face the ""wrong way,"" looking away from the goal rather than towards it. The movers should be double sided or the bases should be color coordinated with the movers to make it easier to locate the correct movers.",Kids_games

1737,"I purchased this for my children, a boy 8 and a daughter almost 10. My son seems to enjoy it the most. It is not terribly high-tech, but they do learn things. It works by inputting the card number into the laptop and lights blink on the sides of the cards where terms or titles are listed. The picture on the card has numbers and you type in the number that corresponds with the word beside the blinking light. For example, a card of geographical features lists things like Island, Peninsula, Plain, Cape, Cove, etc. and the picture has numbers pointing to various geographical features so the child has to type in the number to match the definition with the pictured landform. So low tech, but they enjoy it. It doesn't talk but beeps when the answer given is wrong. There is a +/- key to adjust the volume.

1738,"I purchased this item to use for a Siberian Husky puppy and was very disappointed when it arrived. The sides which show a dog resting its head on are barely able to hold up my hand. With only the slightest pressure the sides cave in and fold over which defeats the purpose. The bottom is VERY thin and can be pinched between two fingers. Your pet might as well be laying on the carpet. The ""sherpa"" cover is also extremely thin and not very soft. It is more like a car buffing material. Lastly the item I received was very dirty on the foam bottom so it was probably returned from previous purchaser.

1741,"These hot rollers are not the best but not the worset.Pros....They heat up fast and do not take long at all to get curls in your hair. They come with two sizes of curlers which allows you to have some creativity. There is 10 of each size which allows you to have enough of just one size curl if that is the look you are after. The curls last all day as long as you allow them to cool before running your fingers through them and of course stay away from brushing them unless you want to relax them to just soft body.Cons....No matter how hard I try I am unable to get curls without the clips creating lines in my hair. While I have read some reviews that you can fix this with touching up with a straight iron I refuse to spend money on a hot roller set that does not allow me to fix my hair with speed. Not to mention the added damage drying my hair, curling with the hot rollers and then having to use a flat iron. That does not seem convenient to me nor healthy for my hair.Bottom line....while they work if you do not want lines in your hair left by clips then keep looking for another hot roller set.",Pet_care

1766,"I bought this when I adopted a 10-lb. pomeranian mix from the shelter to store his food. He only eats 1/2 cup a day, but I feed him really premium food, which is much more budget-friendly when bought in the biggest bag (of small breed kibble) they make. I was hoping by using this container, it would eventually pay for itself with the money I would save being able to keep a bigger bag of food fresh. One big bag (maybe 18 pounds?) theorteically would last him 3 months, but near the end (about 2 months in), he was less and less interested in his food--even so disinterested that he would sometimes not bother with his treat ball toys that I would put some of his food in for him to have a game to get his food. He still likes the brand of food I get because he gets so excited when I have a fresh batch, so I know his disinterest is not from boredom with the food (also, I change brands fairly often after the food is used up, with the same reaction near the end of 2 months). The food did not go bad in this container--it didn't smell bad--it just went stale, even very tightly sealed, so that it was less appetizing (and maybe less healthy since I don't know how well the nutrients fared over time).ANY food you buy, you should use within a month of opening it or it will go stale--even in a great container like this. So if you're using this container to store food, buy bags that are one month's worth of food each unless maybe you have a vacuum sealer to seal up whatever you have opened but won't use by the end of the month. (Freezing also helps.) But in that month, you can expect the food to be kept very fresh and protected in this container. I had no problem with ants, dogs, cats, or moisture getting into this container. They don't even bother with it. I just had to start buying my dog smaller bags of food--the size he could use in a month. I use this container for holding dog treats now, and I actually don't use any kind of special container now for the food because I got another, bigger dog and between the two of them, they eat one big bag (now about 27 lbs., which obviously won't fit in this size container) in about a month anyway. Maybe if I start having problems with staleness with my current method(I roll up the bags tight each time and use a bag clip), I'll get a BIG Vittles Vault--because overall it's a great product--but I won't get one sized any bigger than will hold a month's-worth of food for my dogs.Mine also came with a shallow, 1-cup food scoop that I still use. It would be better if it had markings in it that showed measurements--but if you regularly use a specific measurement less than 1 cup and don't trust yourself just eyeballing it, you can mark it yourself by measuring/pouring the proper amount of food into it with a real measuring cup and then marking a line at the top of the food.If anyone knows of a good, user-friendly, practical vacuum sealing food storage container, do let me know. I would think that would prolong food shelf life best.",Pet_care

1772,"I purchased this crate in size large for a 45lbs Pit mix. Let me start off by saying the build quality is great. It is very easy and straight forward to put together. The brown is definitely darker than pictured but is very nice. I was looking for something that is more pleasing to the eye in my home and I have to say it looks really good. If my review ended here i would give it five stars.Unfortunately, I have a bit of an escape artist and two stars have to be knocked off just because its not meant for my dog. I was hesitant to make the purchase in the first place. Based on the interior of the crate having the wire crate, I felt that it would work for me and went ahead and ordered. Unfortunately the wire is spaced a bit too far apart. After a week of no problems, my dog just decided she didn't want to be in there anymore. She proceeded to tear holes through the wicker and squeeze herself out. Its amazing how small of a hole a determined dog can squeeze through. So I suppose I should have known better with my dogs track record of escaping every crate i have had so far. She is just too smart and powerful for this type of crate.If your dog is similar to mine, i advise looking for something else. If you have a less mischievous dog and your looking for a well built crate that looks great in your home then look no further. Its a fantastic crate that is well worth the money for that type of dog. If you have an escape artist in the family, then it would be better to light your money on fire because essentially that is exactly what i did!",Pet_care

1783,"The Geotrax set is a great toy!!! We just bought the firestation and remote control firetruck for our son at Christmas. He is only 15 months old, but he loves this system!! Since Christmas, we have accumulated a large amount for his Geotrax system. We bought the Mountain Blast for him this month. This is a great addition!! Even though he is very young, he loves to push the dynamite to make the ""blast"" and he can understand how to work the remotes. He also loves to run the windmill. The Geotrax system seems to be very sturdy and durable for the younger children. It can get to be an expensive hobby. There are many more additions that we plan on getting him. The only draw back to that is finding room to store it all when it isn't being played with. Unfortunately, we do not have room to build it and leave it up all of the time, so we build him a small track to keep in his room all of the time and then we build the big layouts for him on the weekends. I love the fact that these additions do not have a bunch of little pieces that come apart, but it does present a problem as far as storage. There are a few things that they could do differently to make this set even better. The trains need to have 2 different speeds and go in reverse. That would make it alot more fun to play with. You will definetly need to invest in rechargeable batteries!!!!! You will go broke trying to replace regular batteries, they die out pretty fast. The rechargeables are more expensive to start, but they definetly pay off in the end. I would recommend this set to anyone with little kids - girls or boys.

It has worked out really well for us. Before getting this litter box, we'd tried the conventional litter boxes and the self-cleaning type that you roll back and forth. We had problems with odors with both, but the biggest problem was that no one wanted to deal with the mess.We own 1 cat who is about to turn 6 years old. He weighs 13-14 pounds and eats Purina One. We change out the cartridge about once every 4 weeks. The box works just as the video instructions on amazon demonstrates. We just remove the cartridge and place it in the trash can outside without any mess. Very convenient.The criticisms I do have (why the product doesn't get 5 stars from me) is the cost. I paid around $95 for the regular one, and I think that price is a bit high for the product. In addition, there is only ONE place in my town where I have been able to find the refills. They charge $15.99 per cartridge, and $45.99 for a pack of 3 (a $2.00 savings). Since that's the only store that carries the refills in my town, I have to make sure to keep one cartridge on hand at all times so that I don't ever need a refill when the store is out of stock.",Pet_care

It didn't take long for our cats to figure these balls out - I just rolled it around in front of them to show them how and they got it right away. These work perfectly for what we needed them for. These food balls have held up very well. We have all four colors, but for some reason our cats prefer the pink and orange balls - those are always the ones that end up empty first (not sure why), though they will eat from the green and blue ones when the pink and orange are empty.

Like any toy, they will get bored so using it for short periods of time and then letting it disappear for a while works best. Of the 5 images that can be produced, the dot is the brightest and seems to be the most intriguing for the cats. The smiley face, mouse, butterfly and star are more interesting to the owners than they are to the cats...the cats just want to chase a bright light around and these images are not as precise or bright so they seem to be less fun to chase.

The stick part is a clear strong but slightly flexible plastic.The ""ribbon"" part is a four foot long narrow strip of a stretchy polar fleece type of material. It does sometimes get snagged on the cats claws. However a flick of your wrist and it comes undone.One of the best things about this toy is that you don't have to move around too much to entertain the cat with it because the ""ribbon"" is so long. Also it's a quiet toy.Overall, I think this would be a great toy to add to your cats toy collection!",Kids_games
1801,"To be honest, I do not own a huge dog (my pup is only 10 pounds)...so why did I get the huge bed? I have a good, old-fashioned bamboo mama-san (bowl)chair that I have not been able to part with. However, the cushions get well worn and can be lumpy or simply not in colors that I would like. I decided to try the largest size dog bed and it is a PERFECT fit! It is far superior in cushioning and so comfy that my family fights over who gets to sit in the chair. We even bought a second one and now have one as a floor cushion for lounging on. These are HIGH quality, well-made and come in fabrics that match my furniture, so they are WELL worth purchasing...EVEN if you have a BIG DOG that is going to use it instead of a big kid!",Pet_care
1802,"My daughter recieved this toy when she was about 1 1/2 years old. She is now 3 1/2 and still plays with Noah's Ark. We bought a lot of the Little People toys, and this was her favorite. In fact, we have handed down most of her LP playsets to younger cousins, but she threw a fit to keep the ark. The extra animal sets are also really great and worth the money!",Kids_games
1803,I purchased this for my granddaughter's 1st birthday. This was the gift that she took to bed with her that night! She just loved it. I just purchased another one for my grandson who is 8 months old because I couldn't wait until his 1st birthday to give him one!,Kids_games

1805,"I got this game as a gift from a friend... and I enjoy it sooo much!!! It's a pretty good ""boardgame simulation"" of an aerial battle. It's alot of fun...and it isn't too short or too long to play. You can play it over and over again and it's still fun. I suggest this game for anyone who wants to have a good time...whether it be a rainy day inside... or a sunny day sipping lemonade outside.",Kids_games
1806,"My 6 yr old went crazy when she saw these in the store. We bought all 4 of them and they were opened before we got in the door.

1808,"Though I knew this was an 18"" figure, I was still surprised at how massive it is-and heavy. I recently bought two, one to display and the other to sell somewhere down the line...yes, I'm a geek... Regardless, for collectors like me, this figure is definately worth the price. The detail is immaculate down to the actual bullets in Hellboy's ""Good Samaritan."" I love how the figure is also wearing stitched clothing which gives it a more textured appearance. The gun is a little hard to squeeze into Hellboy's hand, but there is a holster on his belt that serves as a temporary sanctuary. The tail is a bendy, so you don't have to worry about it getting in the way as you pose it on your bookshelf. Speaking of posing, the figure can be easily placed in an upright position without it falling over. The one gripe I have is the packaging. It took me ten minutes to untie all the twisties which was a royal pain. All in all, you don't have to be a Hellboy fan to appreciate the artistry of this figure.",Kids_games

1810,"I got this for my squirrel-chasing, bicycle-lunging, pulling-towards-dogs dog, after he choked himself on a regular collar once so hard he threw up.He is a polite walker now. No more pulling. He eagerly noses into it when I pull it out. It did take a couple of sudden backflips for him to learn that this harness won't put up with that kind of behavior. The leash attaches to the front, so a sudden lunge will pull him around right quick, often flipping him over. A heavier dog might not be as resilient to this as my 40-lb pup.It doesn't fit quite as the instructions intend, since it creeps up over his shoulderblades instead of sitting behind them, but it does the job anyway. And it might not be ideal for shorter dogs, as the lower attachment point does result in more leg tangles. I even taught my dog to lift the foot I point to on command to make untangling easier.It also makes a handy handle to hold him by that is easier on him than the collar.",Pet_care
1811,"We adopted a bichon a few years ago from a rescue shelter.

The Ocean Wonders Aquarium works great &amp; I would recommend it. However along with our son, we like the Slumbertime better. It seems to help more when he's fussy and doesn't want to go down for a nap. The little bears on the sides really grab his attention and distract him from being upset when they are activated. Sometimes when it's quiet in his room I'll peek in and there he is sitting up watching it like he's watching television, then before long he's off to sleep. If fact, I'm purchasing three more today, so he goes down a little easier when visiting his Grandparents and Aunt. I would highly recommend both monitors, but if I did it all over again I would purchase the Slumbertime over the Ocean Wonders Aquarium. Reason being",Kids_games

1831,"Why run with the crowd?If you wear cologne and you're interested in something REALLY different, an Annick Goutal eau de toilette may be just what you are looking for. They are not cheap, but a little bit goes a long way, and it is unlikely that you'll smell like anybody else in the neighborhood.I have worn Goutal's Eau D'Hadrien as my ""signature scent"" for more than 10 years. It has a bright, woodsy, citrus scent and while Goutal recommends it for ""evening wear,"" I think it's appropriate for daily use. That's not necessarily true of Mandragore.Mandragore is a very ""dark"" scent. Goutal says that's the smell of the mandrake root. I'll take their word for it since I have no idea what mandrake smells like. But be that as it may.... Mandragore is a very dark, rich, almost ""chocolaty"" scent. Eau D'Hadrien is dashing; Mandragore is elegant. It reminds me of dark wood, leather and old country homes that I couldn't possibly afford, (not in this life time anyway). If you're in the habit of ""splashing on"" your cologne, you're going to use way too much. I think it's too bold for daily wear. But on that special night when you want to impress that special someone, Mandragore will transform you into the Dark Knight - a man of mystery. The rest is up to you.",Perfumes

I agree with another reviewer that it would be helpful if the toy would tell the child when he/she has not actually spelled a word. In some of the activities I know my son has believed himself to have spelled a word, when it wasn't.

But the most fun is that you get to vote players out of the game! You get small dry-wipe cards so you can secretly write who you want to vote off the island!

So if your cat is wearing it at a comfortable size and this part is tugged, even if the breakaway magnet does not open, you cat will be able to squeeze out of the now larger collar. And the breakaway magnet works well...it takes a good firm tug for it to open up.

They didn't look like acne to me, they looked like my skin was having a allergic reaction to something I put on it and the pharmacist at CVS agreed with that notion. I stopped using this and kept treating my skin with the addition of topical cortisone and a oral anti-histamine to my routine. That same day the irritating feeling and bumps slowly but surely started to go away. With in I'd say 3-4 days the bumps were completely gone! Fast forward about 1 month later silly me wanted to be SURE this was what caused my reaction (and not a cheaper detergent I started using around the same time I initially broke out) so 2 days ago I smeared some more of this stuff on and when I woke up the next morning...whoomp there they were, more of the same small, iritating bumps.

1877,I rate this as a good toy overall because I have only found one thing with it I don't like...the motor is a little noisey..I had read other reviews on this toy saying the same thing..my daughter just turned 1 on Nov. 22 and she got this for a gift..she loved it from the moment we brought it into her sight..She loves to stand at it and knock the blocks off of it over and over again..she has probably over 50 blocks now and beleive it or not it holds everyone of them....good storage too..they all are in one spot for easy access for her..I give it five stars for fun because I even like getting down and playing with her..Educational value is great too because they learn to stack the blocks good eye hand cordination skills are learned through this...Durability is a five because my daughter loves to climb..she is a bit on the small size in weight but she has been walking and climbing on things since she was 10 1/2 months old and she can't seem to destroy this toy yet...I would buy this for any friend who had a child.,Kids_games

The computer and it's chair are especially fun to play with. What seems to fuel a lot of imagination is the closet next to the computer screens. It can be rotated so that you put Batman in, turn it, and open the door to see Batman GONE! Whoa, right? The entire mansion itself can be collapsed, which is nice for travel to Grandma's or to the living room.This toy supplies lots of fun, whether you like Batman or not!",Kids_games

They had always gotten into the ones with the flap doors and we have big dogs so the top entrance ones wouldn't help either. I saw this and thought it would be perfect. Unfortunately it doesn't latch like EVERY OTHER CAT BOX EVER. No, the top dome just kinda sit on top. If you have very active cats, they can even knock off the cover. It was a pain to move around too. it's not even bigger than a normal cat box, just takes up more room because of the stairs. It's also harder to clean out. Liners don't fit properly and it's curved inside so it can be difficult to clean the edges. All in all, not a smart product.",Pet_care

1902,"I've purchased every Ring related game except for the Fantasy Flight series. With that being said my favorite (and the best) is the long out of print SPI title ""War of the Ring"" to which the current title under review owes a great deal of it's appeal and design. This is a strategic level WAR game, centering on the military aspects of war in the LOTR, while incorporating the familiar characters we've come to love or dread. This is not a product for celebrating your 7 years birthday child whose hero is Frodo. It is a mature game requiring patience, intelligence and at least some measure of strategy and tactics. Your [...] will certainly enjoy the plastic figurines (I enjoy them as well and when no one is looking I'll play toy soldiers with them!). Set aside an entire evening or maybe even 2 evenings to play the game thru to completion . The expansion set (which I review elsewhere) brings the same qualities but to the tactical level. A younger person might relate to that better since it incorporates the battle sequences familiar from the movies. I rate it 5 stars but keep in mind it is not a ""fun for the whole family"" nor a ""thrill packed adventurous journey in Middle Earth"". It's a war game first and foremost. But man, those plastic figures are super cool any way you see it!",Kids_games

1907,"This is such a sweet toy. I can't say enough good things about it, really. I found this on-line while I was creating my baby registry, and decided when my daughter was born to investigate further to see if it was actually something we wanted to purchase. I am so glad that we did. So much so that it has become the gift that I give to all my friends at their baby showers. It is just the best.From very early on, I found that my daughter was soothed by the music. I could put her in her crib (with the toy a safe distance away, of course :)) and turn it on, and it would hold her attention so I could attend to other things. Now that she is 7 months old, it has become a savior at night. My daughter is a tough sell at 'night-night' time, but 'Mr. Pooh' has become a staple in our nightly routine. As soon as I press the pillow to start the music, she smiles.We recently travelled to visit my husband's family and took 'Mr. Pooh' with us. If my daughter became fussy once I put her down to sleep, I could easily turn this on and within minutes, she would settle down. It was great, and the slowly dimming night-light was a real added bonus.It's really not a toy you might rate as very 'educational' in the traditional sense perhaps (except that it does expose your child to different musical and nature-type sounds). But if your child likes music, as mine does, this is a wonderful addition to any toy repertoire. I just think it's the sweetest, and so does my daughter, which is really all that counts, huh? :)",Kids_games

In searching, I stumbled upon this game and although I didnt know anything about it or anyone that had purchased it, the reviews swayed me. Well I was not disappointed. My step daughter absolutely loved it. She spent the entire day of her birthday playing with her Mom and anyone else she could convince to play with her. She thanked me over and over again and said it was great. To top it all off it reached her 2 days after i placed the order with regular shipping.

When I put those on, the cats would wiggle and squirm trying to get the collar off and with the safety snap they eventually unlatched them. Plus, the width of other collars tends to mat the hair around their necks.This collar, so far, is far superior. Two of my cats were hesitant about having something go over their head, but once the Safety Collar was on, they haven't thought twice about it. They haven't tried to get them off or scratched at them, it doesn't seem to bother them at all and since these collars are so thin, the fur on their necks aren't suffering.The sliding motion of the collar is easy to move back and forth yet secure enough to stay in place with regular use. The colors are very vibrant. I got Mango Orange, Maui Blue, and Tulip Red but unfortunately, since my cats have long hair the color gets lost in their fur. But that doesn't take anything away from how much I love these collars.If your not sure, these are inexpensive enough to give a try!

1940,"I was at the fragrance counter at the mall, going through all of the generic floral/vanilla/oriental perfumes, when I sniffed L'eau par Kenzo. It started out with a sparkling burst of a leafy, grassy note that instantly reminded me of a fresh spring lawn covered with dew. Then the grassy note merged harmoniously with a bright citrus, which later warmed up at the edges with a sweet hint of vanilla. The light drydown was ethereal, and reminded me of something warm and watery (in a good way) and shifting. It lasted on me for the rest of the day, and I caught whiffs of it throughout the night.The delicacy and harmony of the notes in this perfume is very impressive. Rather than hitting you over the head with a bunch of cloying flowers, it starts off with a unique splash of green, and then proceeds to morph into a lovely, clean, slightly sweet and unobtrusive aura.This is a wonderful departure from the typical headache-inducing mass-market scents that smell like candied flowers and fruits. It makes a statement by NOT assaulting your nose and screaming SMELL ME. It's one of those scents that, like a dream, will stay with you, and will make you perk up each time you catch a whiff of it in the future.This perfume has the delicate touch and quality of artisan and niche perfumes, and I was pleasantly surprised by its very accessible price tag. I usually pay 2-3 times more for something of this quality. The only downside is that it's a very light scent, and will probably disappear in colder weather. The only solution is to keep spritzing it on you throughout the day.",Perfumes

I tried doing a few models, but am not the modeling type - - so when I stumbled across the Papo dinosaurs, it was like a gift!! These are sturdy, durable, extremely realistic toys - and my first one was the lovely Velociraptor. It's great! A realistic, mature depiction of what a real Raptor might look like - and the working jaw is nice, but it's a display toy; meant more for office spaces at work, or a desktop (for an adult) than it is for a kid. It's nice to not have them so articulated, as it adds to the realism of the creature and pose. The JPark toys were horrible, and not very good representations of realistic dinos. The Papo creatures are just right if you want a good, adult dino to spark your imagination. Great, great toys - you can't get 'em any better than this!!",Kids_games
1962,"Kirk's Castile Original Coco soap is perfect for those that do not wish to have animal by- products in their soaps, nor use products tested on animals. The information contained on the packaging clearly states that there are no synthetic detergents or animal by-products. The glycerin used in the soap is vegetable and the rest of the formula is quite simple. I had been looking for a vegetarian friendly soap, and found it in this product that has been around since 1839. The soap provides a rich lather, and washes off better than many of the soaps on the market. The fragrance of the soap is pleasant and not overbearing. The soap does seem to last a shorter time, but the results on the skin and the knowledge that the soap is all natural and guilt free makes it worth buying a bit more frequently. I am surprised organizations that promote vegetarian lifestyles do not mention this soap,as I could have used it years ago. Besides buying it on Amazon, it's also available in major grocery stores (Fry's, Safeway, etc) and independent stores, as well as Kirk's on-line.",Pet_care

1966,"The turbo twist spelling is a terrific educational tool, however, it is worth the extra $$ for the mind station. My first grader struggled with his weekly spelling tests. He was even put in a special group that only tested on half of the words. It really became a chore and he was getting discouraged. For Christmas he received turbo twist spelling and the mind station which enabled us to download just his spelling words for the week. He has scored 100 on every exam since then and scored extra points for challenge words as well!!! I am amazed at what a difference this has made. We have all of his tests since Christmas on the fridge. Thank you!",Kids_games
1967,"I bought this collar for my 9 lb. Havapoo and I'm having trouble getting it adjusted properly for him. Though very furry, he's got a tiny neck and the pronged electronic piece is a little heavy. Thus the behavior I get when I put it on him in any location on his neck is that it falls below his neck and I think it's losing contact. Now clearly, this is not the fault of the product as it works just fine (tried it on my leg). However, I would caution owners with very small dogs that it might be difficult to adjust properly. We have an electric fence for our 90 lb. Golden Retriever but you can't fence a 9 lb. and a 90 lb. dog on the same system. Thus we tried this remote. One other very important caution - READ ALL THE DIRECTIONS FIRST! I almost cut through the wire transmitter on the collar when adjusting the length to fit Rocky. Luckily, I didn't. In summary, this collar works fine but for very small dogs, the weight of the receiver may prevent good contact. I'm still going to try to get this to fit better as I believe that it's a good product.",Pet_care

1976,"I was very impressed by the quality of these hooves. Usually I purchase a ten pack of hooves for my dogs at my local Pet Food Express for about $8, which is a good value. This is a far superior deal. The hooves are nearly twice as large, ranging from 3.5""-5"", mostly on the larger end of the scale. I estimate that there are about thirty in the 5lb box, but due to their superior size, you get at least 25% more value with this over the Pet Food Express hooves, maybe as much as 50%. I will definitely buy these again.If you have never purchased cow hooves for your dog, there are two important aspects to consider -- one positive, and one negative. On the downside, they stink, and they make your dog smell like a barnyard (temporarily). Not a good thing. On the other hand, they have unsurpassed benefits. They are long-lasting (days or weeks rather than minutes) and they remove tartar from a dog's teeth better than anything else I've tried. Bully sticks get eaten too fast, raw hide isn't digestible and can damage a dog's intestines, and knuckle bones lose their charm after the yummy bits are gone. These hooves, however, are fabulous. My 5 year old dog has completely reversed her tooth decay after a year chewing hooves, and she used to have the telltale black-brown color at the top of all of her teeth. Now they are white again!I cannot recommend hooves more highly. And these are good quality hooves.",Pet_care

1981,"Our 8 pound terrier/yorkie mix is sweet as can be, but she has a most unpleasant high pitched bark.. She would bark when anyone came by our house or if anyone came to the door. She would bark if a doorbell rang on TV. She would bark if another dog in the neighborhood was barking. I tried the water spray, which worked, except I couldn't always get to her in time for it to be effective.This collar, has changed our lives. The first time I put it on her, she barked ONCE. After that, she went to her bed and we didn't hear a peep out of her for 2 hours. I took the collar off and she remained quiet for the rest of the day.. That evening she started barking so I put the collar back on. Again, she barked ONCE and stopped. Since then, she has not barked at all in the house. Once in a while she will have a little growl, but all I have to do is show her the collar and she stops. I would highly recommend this product. It's safe, humane and effective..Thank you.",Pet_care

I have a hard time making it pop when I am pushing it myself, exerting considerable downward force.My one year-old daughter is a great walker but could never get this going. She carries it around with her sometime, but I don't even think she understands what it is supposed to do.Additionally, the older models used to have a switch on the underside that could turn off the ""popping."" This switch is gone. When I called my Mom to complain that ours didn't work, she told me to check to make sure it was in the ""on"" position.

1991,"Several months ago one of my domestic short hairs started shedding. It was spring, shedding was to be expected. She was shedding a LOT, so much that when my husband and I went to pet her gobs of hair would go flying everywhere and we would both end up with stuffy noses, even though we both have very mild allergies. Her fur was EVERYWHERE- even in gobs on the ceiling fan and the WALLS. This went on for months, and when I realized she'd been shedding this much for too long I got worried. When I pulled her hair just seemed to come out! So panicked and took her to the vet. He checked her out and told me there was nothing wrong with her- she was perfectly healthy, but just had a heavy undercoat that wasn't coming off with my normal brushing. He pulled out one of these babies and did a once over- I was standing there panicking and asked a few times just to make SURE that she was okay.. I couldn't believe all the fur that was coming off!! He recommended this to me, so I went home and did my research on it.I ordered and when it came in I sat my kitties down to be brushed. Due to the reviews I was careful about how much pressure I put on the brush, and brushed like the vet did (not a normal brush). Here's the thing (IMPORTANT TIP:) you need to brush in short bursts (one or two inches, maybe more), and go back up and start near where you ended, and repeat going down the way the fur grows. You can do this in a faster motion if you'd like, just don't do it with too much pressure. If you just drag it all along the cat, I would imagine that may just rip the hair and just not be very good in general. I was careful about how many times I went over them, but never saw any thinning at all.Lots of fur came off of both of them, and I finished up with a regular wire brush to smooth things out and get the extra out, then pet them lastly to get any stuff hanging around. Works like a charm! I LOVE this thing! Both of their coats are even softer and shinier than they were before (they were already very much so). The one that was shedding most NEVER likes being brushed, but she tolerated it. The other of my cats loves being brushed and loved this also, so no problems with them not liking it.Over all I'm very pleased with Furminator, as are my kitties! No more undercoat making them extra hot in this summer heat, giving them digestive issues, or getting all over the apartment! 5 stars! I would recommend it to others. (However this is only for short haired cats- I am unsure how well it would work on a long haired cat.)",Pet_care

We were terribly wrong! We have 2 friends who also bought this and are just as disappointed.This is not a toy you can give a child and walk away. First, it's complicated to use for a toddler. Every time you turn a page, you must hit the green go button. RIGHT! Second, the books are made of paper and are pretty flimsy. Plus they are rather pricey for the cheap quality. Third, the setting that reads the story is so slow, my impatient toddler never lets me wait to turn the pages before the story is ready. Finally, I'm not pleased with the educational value of the books for the cost. I can buy books on shapes, color, numbers,etc myself and sit and go through the books with my son and he gets a lot more out of it.Overall, I should have taken this (and the 5 books we bought) back and bought something else.",Kids_games

It feels as though the head has a base formed with a styrofoam type product, unlike the rest of the body. I have my doubts that the head would hold up to much pressure. This is the only reason I've given the giraffe a 4 star rating for durability.

2041,"I use this to easily dry off dogs after a bath, it also really helps with shedding. (I have a german shepherd, they shed ALL the time). When using it, don't be afraid to put the tip of the precision nozzle up into their fur and use small, fast circles to blow out the most moisture and shed fur.Be careful using this on paws. Keep it away from the animal's face. In general, do not use it on extremities or areas with thin fur. If the dog has been shaved recently, do not use it on their bare skin. This is more powerful than a leafblower, be conscious of where you point it. If you drop the hose, it's going to look like an acme cartoon.I also use this for other things. I'm a computer geek, for example, and this can clean out a computer much faster than canned air can - and is actually safer because you have no risk of spraying refridgerant onto your components.Pros:-Multitasker-Two speeds-Does not get hot and burn the dog-Reduces shedding, can dry a dog off completely, and adds just the right amount of 'poof'.-Grounded so as not to create static and make long coated dogs' fur clingy (and it doesn't fry computer parts!)Cons:-Sort of loud, keep it as far away from the dog and you as you can.-Control ring on the nozzle feels cheap-Funnel attachment tends to blow off like a rocket, keep a hand on it at all times when you use it!-Misuse can very rapidly scare an animal for life.Other thoughts:-This is not a toy, but a very powerful tool. Don't let kids use it to dry the dog, ever.-Positive reinforcement is a good thing, have treats when you use it-Remember not to point it at ANY bodily orifices! Period!-Don't forget to clean the filter.-If you use it for computers, do so on mildly humid days. Do not do it where a bird can potentially 'bomb' the system. Do not do it indoors. Have the computer outside for no more than 5 minutes. If you're paranoid, loop a ground wire around the case of the computer and this thing's metal case, scratch the paint to insure a ground.",Pet_care

2051,"I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old. I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007. The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product. I supplement with one serving fromHolistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag.The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17. The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.) If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.I then split one can between all three twice a day. When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food. This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches, The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator. I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water. Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry. Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive. If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.With the free shipping, it is still a deal.Edit",Pet_care

About 3 months ago, he started having chronic diarrhea that got worse and worse. The vet tested him for everything and did x-rays and tried multiple medications, but he still didn't get better. Than as a last thought, we decided to try to stop using the pill pockets completely and just giving him his medication in his food. Within 5 days, our cat was back to normal, and within a few weeks he wasn't dehydrated anymore and gained some weight back. I was very pleased with this product until I realized it was what was making my cat sick. I thought it might just be him, but I found other sites online where people had cited the same problem. I think this is a great product for help administering short-term medications, but I would make sure to monitor your cat if you are using them long-term.

I called the customer service, who are supposed to be open until 8 EST. They weren't, so I called from work. The first time I called, they said that I needed the model number before they could talk to me. The person I talked to also said that they were open until 8, and that I could call when I got home. I told her that I had tried the night before, and she said that they were having phone problems that night. So, I went home, and tried calling again. Still not open after 6. So I got the model number, and called again from work. Mind you, each time you call, you have to wait for at least 10 or 15 minutes on hold until you get someone. I finally got another person, who told me that I now need the date code. So back home, check the date code, and call back during work again next day. ""Sorry, that's the wrong date code."" I needed to open up the cover for the computer chip and pull it out. The number was written on the chip in pen. I also took the unit apart to find out what was actually wrong with it. There is a cheap plastic gear inside the mechanism that got bent, and that is what was causing the problem. So, I called back today. Finally, they told me that I had to cut the computer chip off, and send that with a check for $10 to their company for shipping and handling, and they would send me a new unit. I asked for a supervisor, and was told that I was talking to one. I told her that the product is junk, and that the service is horrible. She said she was sorry to hear that, and I hung up. Don't waste your money on this product. There's got to be something better out there.

I'm not a cologne expert or anything but I have owned a few ""good"" brand named fragrances over the years that I have paid 30 to $50 a bottle for a couple ounces. I must say the bod fragrances rank right up there in my book. A couple sprays and your good all day. Be careful with the large 8 oz. bottles because they have a really wide spray dispersal and you will smell too strong if you don't go easy with it. BOD is potent, but smells good if sprayed moderately (1 or 2 sprays for big bottle 2 or 3 for small bottle). Depending on the person you may have to spray more or less. If you are a regular working guy who wants to smell good and not spend $50 a bottle you can get 5 or 6 bottles of bod for the price of one brand named fragrance. I especially like Fresh Guy, Money, Black, Really Ripped abs, Rock Hard, Tekno in that order.

2072,"Satin is among the very, very (disappointingly) few hair colors that have a violet shade. It's named mahogany violet (labeled 4MV). It isn't outre (punky) at all, really it isn't. It looks like a nice dark brown but especially when in sunlight, there is a violet sheen. I considered using a drabber because I prefer ash tones, but I didn't want to get too fancy.Another good feature of this product is when mixed with developer it becomes the consistency of custard in 5-7 minutes so it doesn't drip, but it also doesn't squeeze out of those pointy applicators -- you must use a bowl and brush.For the first year or so that I've been using this hair color, I was pretty happy. Then I guess I got more grey hair so that now, it doesn't cover it anymore. I've tried increasing the proportion of dye to CG (as in 'cover grey') developer from 1:2 to 1:1, or even stronger; leaving it in way longer than the recommended 45 minutes... but as soon as I finish the coloring process, I can already see hairs and roots that are very, very light. The color fades within 2-3 shampoos even though it's supposed to be 'permanent' hair color.Maybe my coarse Asian hair is more resistant or some other special factor like that, but I would not recommend Satin to cover grey.If I have to color my hair every 2-3 weeks, I may as well go back to Wella's Color Charm semi-permanent color of Deep Violet (3V) andWella Color Charm Creme Developer - 30 Volume 16 oz.

About 3 years ago, I migrated to Surya dyes--first, out of curiousity (because I try anything *henna*), and then stayed with it, because of its terrific ease of use.For me, at least, the verdict is now in:The best thing about this product is how easy and quick it is to apply, and rinse out (compared with alternatives.)I mix this color with *Dark Reddish Blonde* and obtain a very natural-looking sandy red. Used by itself, it simply does not cover gray (unless you'd count a dusty yellow tinge. *Golden Brown*, um, no.) Any of the Red/Reddish colors (which do cover gray) will turn you into Ronald McDonald (with fading pinkish tones--ew!) when used alone.At this point, I have to apply every couple weeks--because, yes, a skunk line appears.

Excellent air flow with lots of screen. The large model fits across the back seat of the car, leaving pleanty of room inside.The directions are vague, actually non-existant. I've found the retention straps hold the Kennel most solid when looped over the seat back. Looped over the seat belts it's too loose and shifts around the back seat too much. If your car has back seats that fold for access into the trunk it will be easy to install and remove. To hold it tight, you will need to run the strap up behind and over the top of the seat back.

And, the kids do have to put a six piece puzzle together.Second, the not so positive- this game is not so fun for adults. There are other fun games that both kids and adults can play. This game is also very easy. VERY EASY for a four year old and yet four year olds are what the Dragon Tale game and show is supposed to be geared for, so there is not a good match there in my opinion.Basically your child will have a game token with one of the Dragon Tale characters on it. You spin a spinner and move your piece that many places. You land on some places where you get to pick a puzzle piece up and some you have to give up a puzzle piece. When you have collected your puzzle pieces together and made your puzzle work, you have won the game. There are only about four spots that provide you the opportunity to pick up a piece or lose a piece. Also, one spot lets you pick up three pieces at once and another spot lets you pick where you want to go on the board. So, depending on how the game goes- it can be over VERY quick or last a long time.There are some great games out there for young children. Penguin Pat is one we have enjoyed, Memory and others. This one is fine if yoru child LOVES Dragon Tales and will enjoy it because of the show connection. However, there are other games I'd get over this one.Enjoy.",Kids_games

2092,"I have natural dark brown thick hair, and have dyed it red with two chunks that I have bleached to a platinum level 9 blonde. The red when I do my roots always gets in the rinse and turns the platinum pink so I'm always re-bleaching. Obviously I have some very damaged hair in these areas. I decided I needed to get them red to alleviate further damage but they won't hold color. This product was supposed to be a miracle but I tried putting on hair first and mixing with color, neither worked the blond spots only came out a slightly darker pink.In the end I used a temporary semi followed by a veggi temporary dye and the pieces are mostly a solid red now. This product probably works great for normal or only moderately damaged hair but it didn't work for mine, which had been all but melted off with bleach.I've been coloring for 10 years now.",Pet_care

The designs of images starting with the letter--same letter as embossed on two sides of the block--are the same color, and very neat and distinct. They include a picture and a name for each design/side. They are very interesting to look at.The tray is not as tall as the blocks, which makes it easier to reach in and remove a block.

2103,"Being used to playing Classic RISK, this game seemed a big complicated when I first started reading the rules. However, after you read the rules and play 1 game, you will be familiar with how the game works and the added complexity of the game introduces VERY new strategies.Those that are familiar with Classic RISK will, at first, think that Godstorm is a complete free-for-all, laden with luck. It will appear that there is much less strategy and much more luck. After playing this game many times though, the astute strategist will realize that there is indeed a lot of strategy involved in RISK Godstorm, and that it is not as much of a luckfest as it might first appear to be.For example, if you never played before and didn't know that the Death Card ""Sink Atlantis"" was out there, you might have all your forces massed in the continent of Atlantis and then suddenly in a blink of an eye be completely demolished from the game. If you knew that the card existed though, and knew that your opponents knew the card existed and so they were scared to take Atlantis, you might easily take and hold Atlantis with a small number of forces (while your main forces work on another continent). You might also summon your God of Death if you hold Atlantis, and try to work on the Death Card stack, hoping to draw the ""Sink Atlantis"" card yourself and give yourself some safety from being sunk. However, you still don't want to mass too many forces there and you probably want to mumble something about how bad your cards are and how worthless they are, because if you act happy about the card you drew and then start massing forces in Atlantis, the other players will know that you drew the Sink Atlantis card (if they are smart). Then if they draw the card that allows them to look at and take another player's cards... you're in TROUBLE!This is just 1 of many examples, but a lot of strategy in Godstorm comes from knowing what cards are out there and playing your cards properly. This element of strategy is non-existent in the Classic RISK. Another example",Kids_games
2104,"The deal is, you have this neopet you have to take care of. You need to feed it about three times a day and they like to play with their toys. You also have to make sure your neopet doesn't get sick (this will hardly ever happen if you feed it enough). You play games to earn neopoints and you use the points to buy things for your neopet.This game has a few flaws. It gets boring pretty easily and there isn't much you can do with your neopet. All you do is feed it a few times a day and earn neopoints. I would say that if you want to buyit, you should. If you're not sure whether to buy it or not, don't.

2109,"I rarely review anything I get, but I had to write something on this product. My cat was overweight, not obese, but he probably wasn't too far away from the cut off between the two. He is strictly an indoor cat and middle aged, so he does not get much exercise. He also had a bowl of food out all the time and could eat at will.When he started to get fat a while ago, we switched him to a weight loss formula food. This did not help much, especially with our feed at will system. I switched to feeding him twice a day, but whenever he got the food, he would just garbage it down with his face and paws in the bowl (cat version of binge eating).In a last resort effort to take some pounds off the cat, I decided to buy the SlimCat ball. It is just like a mini version of a hamster ball (as other people have noted). I put his natural, weight management food in the ball and feed him with it twice a day. He figured out how to use it right away, so we only needed the small holes to release the food. The ball is easy to use, made well (it has survived a young kid throwing it down the hall like a play toy), and the cat seems to enjoy pawing at it to get the food out. I like that he has to move around a little - opposed to the old ""face and paws"" in the bowl version of feeding. Also, since he gets very excited every time the ball comes out, before I give it to him I take about 7 or 10 pieces of food and throw them down the hall one at a time. Since he is hungry, he goes chasing after them (my way of making him workout before his meal). Then I shake the ball (which he comes running to now) and give it to him to push around.He has easily lost about 2-3 pounds within a month using the SlimCat/weight management food/and a little added exercise chasing the food down the hall. I highly recommend this system. I bought a second one, fill them both in the morning, and use one as the morning feeding ball and the other one as the evening feeding ball.This ball is worth every penny, especially if you consider the fact that it probably helped save my cat from becoming diabetic (and yes, they can become diabetic). That alone makes it worth its weight in gold. :)",Pet_care

They are designed to be installed in a door, and the installation is very simple. Two of our doors are actually installed in our walls instead (a little harder, depending on your siding type, but still doable). The only downside is that the door makes a fairly loud clacking sound when a dog runs through and that makes it take a little longer to train timid dogs.

We also have long-furred cats for whom spring is usually a misery of shedding and hairballs. One tends to get bad tangles and matts in her fur. Let me tell you--all of them like this rake and it gets the undercoat quickly and easily so they will be cooler, more comfortable, and less prone to that horrible ACKACKACK I'm-gonna-stain-the-carpet announcement all long-fur-cat owners dread. I myself use a CPAP at night and the straps in back of my hair tend to give me tangles in my super-fine hair. I resorted to trying this on myself a couple of days ago. It's a bit embarrassing to admit but it took MY tangles right out without pulling or discomfort. Honestly, if I had to go through raising little girls again, I'd want one of these to get the tangles from their hair. The tears and conflict over hair brushing would be gone.

2142,"Well I got my bottle of Curve today along with another couple of colognes on the ""So you'd like to...start wearing cologne"" guide on amazon that I have been purchasing by. With all my newfound knowledge about cologne history, perspective, and opinions, I used these colognes to give an informative speech this evening in my public speaking course, complete with all the bottles present. I sprayed CURVE onto myself when it arrived, and now I am comparing all of the new scents to my favorites so far, HUGO and CANDIES. My impression was that it was more serious than Hugo, had a sweetish overtone combined with musk, and then there was sort of a greenish bitter forest type scent to it that I wasn't crazy about. I think I may have been dissappointed at first, but that soon changed. After about fifteen minutes the smell got to be really good and the elements I hadn't liked were gone or had matured into subtle forms that went well together.After the speech I allowed the class to sample all of the colognes, and Curve was commented on the most, followed by Drakkar, then Hugo. All of the women liked it and seemed to have great associations with it, and for that I have to ensure that it gets the full 5 stars. I continue to wear it now later this same evening and it has quite grown on me.If you only bought Curve as your main cologne, you'd be quite alright.

2164,"I got my Omega Paw on Friday after using a make shift litter box from a huge Sterilite Container that I had cut open for the purpose. After seeing the video and reading some reviews about it I figured I'd be able to save some time from scooping and having my cat Buddy clawing at me while I scooped his poo.The packaging was deceptively small - for a while I thought they had delivered the wrong thing. Then I realised it did not come assembled. The assembly wasn't that hard - instructions on the box was simple enough and as Buddy occupied himself playing with the box it came in I was able to put together the Omega Paw in less than 2 minutes. The immediate thing I noticed though was the quality. Whilst the plastic it is designed with makes for an exceptionally light weight product- easy for even a frail arthritic 92 year old granny to turn/ flip over- it also does not make for a very strong product. As I was pressing the grill into place in the little snaps I could see the plastic grill bending with the least amount pressure that I was applying. Neither did the plastic grill lock completely into place as I had expected it should - which is probably why some litter always makes its way into the scoop tray.Additionally the pins are plastic and not at all durable. Thankfully I haven't had to open it since I bought it but I have my doubts about the durability of the pins, as again - they seem to be manufactured of cheap plastic and feel as if they would break if too much pressure is applied in moving them.Moreover, it doesn't completely remove all of Buddy's doo doo... I find myself still having to use his old school scooper to pick up pieces left behind. Maybe I'm not flipping it right? But isn't it supposed to be so deceptively simple that all I'd have to do is flip it? So how the heck could I not be flipping it correctly? Or is it that my cat's poo is so super that it's impervious to the science behind the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box?Finally, and this is more about my preference than anything - the regular size is a lot smaller than I had anticipated it would be. Buddy's a 9 month old kitty but he's already tall and lanky. I ought to have gone with the Large size to give the guy more room to do his business, especially after the large sized make shift container he used before, but still, he manages. To his credit, he didn't need to be re-trained to use this litter box and to the credit of Omega Paw the entrance is suitably high enough so that when he's scratching away at the litter not much gets tossed outside at all.I'd have given this product 2 1/2 stars but Amazon doesn't give me that option - so I decided to be generous and round it off to the nearest star- hence a 3 star rating. All in all it's a wonderful concept, but maybe a better quality material ought to be used and maybe whatever design flaw there is that still allows clumped litter to remain in the box after the flip could be rectified.",Pet_care

I was looking around online yesterday and came across the reviews of the toy on Toys R Us and was a little concerned about the review posted saying that the toy was a failure. That is the last thing I need on Christmas day! So I took it to work with me this morning to see if there is any problems. (I work at a local Porsche Garage) After a complete charging the toy worked great! Like everyone says the flatter the surface the better. All the guys at the shop were very impressed with the design and engineering that went into creating this toy. That hard part was getting it away from the guys so it would not be all scratched up before I could give it to my son. So, I am glad I tested the toy in advance and it seems to work great, I am glad I bought it I am sure it will be a hit. And, no it did not mark up the walls.",Kids_games

The door itself is a basic cat door with no bells and whistles. Once my cats got used to going through it, they like it. Its also a safe zone for them from my dog. My one cat is near 15 pounds and she easily fits through with no struggle. That was my main concern as she is a pretty large cat. The only complaint I would have is the actual swing door sticks a bit so the cats had a small problem getting through. We took off the swing door and just have the frame of the door on and now it works great. I would recommend it if you are not looking to spend too much.",Pet_care

If I pull the barrier towards me and adjust it just a little higher, tighten the knob and then push it into place it's snug enough to stay put. Trying to adjust the height while in place is nearly impossible to make it tall enough to stay in place. The only thing I would change about it is make the top tube just a few inches wider to make less of a gap between the seats. The price is very reasonable. This barrier has definately helped make driving to the dog park safer for me. The dogs stay in the back seat where they should be!

It was a bit discouraging for the children at first because they kept being required to identify countries they'd never heard of, but the more we played, the more they learned, and now they know most of the countries. However, even after they've learned to identify all the countries (and there are a lot, some even I didn't know!), then we can make it more challenging by asking them to name the capitals. There are also blank cards so we can make up a few of our own postcards. It is true that the map is a little small, but this didn't really affect the educational or entertainment values of the game. We didn't play it non-stop when we got it so maybe that's why we didn't master so quickly and then get sick of it. We play it occasionally and always enjoy it.",Kids_games

Instead of the older NHL series SP's that have a sticker with there name and the teams logo it has the name of the player painted on the base.If you are a fan of the Islanders I say this is a must buy if you have been a fan your whole life or just a few years like me.Hopefully TMP will make Al Arbour, and Clark Gillies in the future sometime.",Kids_games
2191,"I was afraid to expect too much, but I shouldn't have been. There was an issue with the long hair from my Golden Retriever, but I found a solution. I trimmed off the teeth of the clipper guide. Her hair was so tangled no amount of brushing would remove the old winter coat, so as bad as I hated it I had to remove almost all of it. By trimming the teeth off the cutting guide I was able to get a very close cut without hurting her. I'm surprised the manufacturer hasn't already designed one without the long teeth that hair gets tangled in. The short guide kept the cutting blades, which can get pretty hot, from burning or clipping her skin.I was afraid the sheer amount of dense, long, thick hair would be a problem. After we were through a shepherd would envy the massive amount of fur we removed. I'm not sure regular steel blades would have survived. The ceramic blades are as sharp as ever, so I'm very happy with my choice. I would recommend them to any dog owner now, regardless of breed. I can't imagine any type of dog having a thicker coat of long, coarse, and dense fur than a Golden Retriever. She may not look like million bucks but I know she feels better in this muggy southern climate.",Pet_care

Walks were a chore, nobody in the family enjoyed it, particular the youngest children who so wanted to be able to ""walk the dog"". The Gentle Leader is amazing! It gives you control over their head. If you are holding the leash firm, their pulling only succeeds in turning their head back in your direction. They simply do not have the pulling strength in their head, that they have in their neck and shoulders. The only issue I've had is that people think that it's a muzzle. Not even close! The dog can eat, drink, bark, all while wearing the Leader. I describe it to people as a horse halter for a dog. It serves the same purpose and works much in the same way. As for adjusting the Gentle Leader, once I put it on my dog, I have to hold the loose skin on her neck and slide the strap up firmly behind her ears. If I don't do this, the lower strap lays across her throat and looks very uncomfortable. I highly recommend this product!",Kids_games

The smell and consistency of the shampoo was wrong. Like I said, I've been using this product for years.

These wipes are very gentle at clearing away the ""gunk"" and his eyes even seem to be better for a day or two after using the wipes. They are more effective than a cottonball and plain water, but not at all irritating to his eyes. I was skeptical about ordering them but went ahead due to other positive reviews.

2239,"We bought this toy when our son was just two months old and he loves it. We are at five months now and he still gets a huge kick out of it.There are so many ways to play! At first we'd lay him on his back an he would swat at the dangling rattles. They are bright and attention-getting. When he'd hit one, music would play and the lights would flash; it kept his attention. It didn't take much effort, and helped develop his coordination. There aren't many toys a two-month-old will play with. Then he learned that he could push the buttons to play and change songs.The toy is re-positionable, so it can be used when the baby is laying down, with the rattles hanging. Tilt it at 45 degrees and sit him in a bouncer or car seat under it. At 90 degrees when he's standing (we still have to help him stand). And with a switch in the legs' configuration, it can be positioned so that he sits and plays.There are (at least) 6 sound modes, ranging from one button playing a whole song, through pressing buttons that prompt a song to continue, to one button being a single tone (like a keyboard).We love this toy and so does our son. It is good for just about everything except tummy time. We expect to get at least a year out of the developmental value.Just another two things about it",Kids_games

While I certainly enjoyed the Armada Unicron (especially since his paint job matched the Movie version), I like this one better. The cool neon green, orange, & black make him more menacing a make for a much cooler looking toy. He has MAJOR articulation (wish he could bring his hand to his mouth, though, so I could pretend he's devouring TFs like in the Movie or issue #75 of the Marvel comic book, though.). One of the best TFs ever, and, either in its Armada or Energon version, worth getting!

After spraying this on my curls and ""scrunching"" upwards, I noticed that it got ""sticky"". After it dries, it leaves my curls somewhat hard and a bit less bouncy, my guess it's because of what's in it.

Anyway, it comes with a little instruction booklet that tells you how to acclimate them to the clicker, and how to teach them to sit, stay, and come.

2262,"This is one of those rainy day toys for us. The kids don't play with it every day, but when they do, they love it. We've set it up with about four different DVD players around the house and never have any problems with it working.The kids usually use it with the TV in the bedroom. They sit all the way across the room in bed. I'm surprised it works from there because of the sheets and the angle of the DVD player from where they are, but it does; and when they occasionally have difficulty, they just try and move the sheets out of the way or pick up the InteracTv so that it points more directly to the DVD player.My kids are 5 and 7 now and the 7 year-old still plays with it, even though it`s far too simple for him. We've had it since he was about 4 years old. My daughter was about 2 when she started playing it.The DVD's feature episodes right out of the TV series. You know how Dora asks questions and the kids have to shout the answers back to the TV? Well, now the kids get to answer them! The answers are presented inside shapes on the screen. If the correct answer is in the square, for instance, the children press the Square on their InteracTv unit. They must choose the correct answer to move on. The children may choose to play games only or do the episode or they may skip forward and back. I thought at first the idea of choosing the correct answer by picking the corresponding shape might be a difficult concept for kids; but from watching my kids, the average 3 year-old should have no problem.My 7 year-old recently asked for me to buy more game packs, so I went online to get Spongebob.

2268,"This was our first automatic litter box. We now have a litter maid, which has its own problems. I prefer the litter maid over this one.What got this one ""fired"" from our house is the pain of changing the trays, nearly always resulting in spillage of the litter. They're too big for standard kitchen-size trash bags and it seems wasteful to use a garbage-can sized bag. if they could separate the waste tray from the litter tray to make disposal easier we might switch back. Also, this unit had poor odor control and required daily use of litter deodorizer. Maybe we just weren't changing the trays often enough but... that would only make the bigger problem even worse. Also, even with the optional lid, there's a lot of clean-up to do to keep the surrounding area tidy -- as much as with any litterbox. That's probably true of all of them, so take that for what it's worth.On the plus side, this one only jammed about once a week or so vs. the litter maid jamming at least once a day. The rake in the scoopfree has a lot less to do, and a flat surface to do it on, so that's not surprising. With a fresh tray I'd have no problems leaving for a couple of days without worry.With the litter maid I just know I'm coming home to a jammed box that needs cleaning.

She was standing well but had just started cruising a little when we got the table so she had some difficulty in navigating around it at first. The table has a variable surface and each side needed a different approach if she was going to stand and play with the toys. Even after placing the table on a playmat to keep it from skidding we had to be close by to catch her on the inevitable tumbles and each attempt ot get around a corner was a struggle. Since then, she's made lots of improvement in moving around and maintaining her balance. While most of that is just growing up, the fun factor of the table motivated her to challenge herself.

I read a lot of reviews and the Baby Einstein line impressed us in general.Let me tell you something, we started sticking our little Bub in this thing at three months, and now, three months later (an eternity... haha) it is STILL one of his favorite places to be.The wonderful thing about this toy is that your child can grow into it (literally... the adjustable heights are a godsend).It has been a lot of fun watching move from accidentally rolling the noisemaker part to constantly attmepting to elicit Old MacDonald to FINALLY figuring out that the star was a giant teething lollipop.The best part though, has been seeing him manipulate the catepillar and moving parts. What I am trying to say is that this toy allows your child to move through stages. Even though the neighbor girl is kinda tall for it at 18 months, she still gets a kick out of it every time she comes over, just from the outside.It's very tactile and rewarding for little ones and big ones alike.Definitely worth the money.*UPDATE* Bub is 8 months old now and STILL loves this thing.

2294,"I had this product from 1998 till 2004. I had 3 cats for most of the time (one being a kitten at first) I would say after 6 years it was worth the $$. I only say that I felt it wasn't deep enough, and my cats would kick litter out int othe pathway. Also the urine would clump t othe bottom of the box and catch on the rake. I reused the litter catchers to the point that I only bought 1 box of 12 boxes plus the 6 that came with the box.I did try the litter with crystals, and I felt that it worked better than just the clumping litter by itself. I didn't like the one that was crystals by themselves. but mixing Tidy cats with crystals (before they did it themselves) worked well.So I say it was a pretty good choice, except when it got hung up if I filled it too full or other reasons. I recomend getting the tent and the ramp to, to keep the scatter down to a managable area.Why don't I still have it? The rake came off of the track several times, and eventualy the motor burnt out and I was ready to try a diffrent box. (currently using the Rolling style box)",Pet_care

Instantly, my dry hair became smooth and wonderful and I knew that I just HAD to go out and buy it. Since then, I've persuaded my sister to buy it.The directions say to use it before and after styling my hair. I use it only after my hair is dry, and sometimes later in the day if I feel I need softer hair again. I think it works best when your hair is dry. It pretty much eliminates the dry ends that I have, and makes my hair oh-so-smooth and touchable. Now, I cannot imagine straightening my curly hair without it. Wonderful! Totally worth it!Also, the product seems to last forever. I only use a very small portion (a dot the size of a dime), and I have lots of long hair.

He hated laying down unless he was sleeping so the little bit of elevation was great. When he started to get more active and needed tummy time, I found this invaluable! Most abbies hate being on thier bellies because it is hard to hold themselves up. This helped my son so that he didn't feel gravity pulling him down. It allowed him to have around 15 minutes of tummy time aday earlier than he would have tolerated it otherwise.

Puerto Rico is definitely one of my favorite games of all time!Only downside is that it is not great for two players; there is a set (or several?) of two-player rules that can be found online, but the game is clearly designed for 3-5 players.

2309,"I bought two of these heated pet mats to heat outdoor doghouses. I was hoping it could warm a small doghouse enough to lure a feral cat to take house in there over the winter. However, the heat, while noticeable to the touch, is not adequate to heat any sort of dog house on it's own. While the mat is always kept at a certain temperature, the mat will feel warmer after some pressure is put on the mat (such as a cat laying on it, or a phone book put on it) as it presses the top layer of the mat to the heat coils below. This is great for conserving the heat in the mat, but it does not work well to lure a wild cat to sleep on it as they must be on it for a minute or so to really feel the heat.After being on continuously in an outdoor doghouse in subzero temperatures, the heat mat stopped working. One that we had plugged in continuously indoors for our housecats also stopped working after about a week. I do not suggest keeping them plugged in on an ongoing basis. It is better to have them plugged in to an electrical timer so that they only go on for a certain part of the day. Despite both mats failing, the manufacturer will replace any defective items very promptly. The customer pays to ship the item to them and the manufacturer will pay the return shipping. The company that I ordered from, QCSupply, also has excellent customer service and emailed me a paid shipping label to get a replacement and also gave me store credit for another one.It should be noted that ""outdoor use"" and ""may be covered with any material"" as mentioned in online descriptions on most websites is the opposite of what is mentioned in the paper insert that comes with these mats ""indoor use only"" and ""may only be covered with the included fleece covering"". Over the phone, the manufacturer said the mats may be used for outdoor doghouses and can be covered with other materials, but nothing too heavy... not sure what to believe, but I'd say play it safe or your mat could stop working all of a sudden.I think this mat would be best on an electric timer for a doghouse that is in a shed or garage in a climate that does not get below 15 or 20 or use for indoor pets.",Pet_care

It takes 26 days for your skin to rollover, so I was going to give it that long to clear up my face. But I couldn't. After 2 weeks, my face was so badly broken out & dry & sensitive that I stopped. My face looked horrible, with or without makeup. It made me so self-conscious that I didn't want to leave the house. Within 2 days of switching back to my normal face wash, my skin was no longer dry, it was softer, and the acne had dried up.

More protein (20g vs 15g per scoop) & fewer calories per scoop.(110 vs. 150 per scoop)The flavor is not as good as the Muscle Milk chocolate powder. It is generally lighter in texture and I think has a hint of coco-nutty flavor. The aroma of the powder is pretty powerful to overwhelming. In my opinion, Muscle Milk Chocolate has set the bar pretty high for any/all chocolate protein powder drinks.The regular Muscle Milk has tons of extra Vitamins and Minerals that this Whey product doesn't have as a meal replacement (see the image I uploaded for the label). So although you could use this product for weight loss, you wont be getting the vitamins and minerals that regular Chocolate Muscle Milk has.It is up to you, but you might want to email the company and ask if they can send you a sample of the product before jumping into spending a lot of money for a large container.

2336,"I ordered one of these boxes just before Christmas since I hate cleaning the litter box and this seemed like it would make the job much easier for me. I had read the reviews and it seemed that the majority were good so I decided to try it out. I was amazed at how quickly it arrived. I immediately opened it and put it together. I did have a little trouble with the clips, as mentioned in other posts, but it wasn't a big deal for me. My 2 cats were wary of using it at first. I already had one covered box and one uncovered box so I didn't think having the cover on would deter them, but they steered clear of it that first day so I took the top off until I saw it had been used. I put the top back on the next day and they've been using it ever since. I love how easy it is to use. I got to the point that I hated having to scoop my other box when this one was so easy to do, so last week I ordered another one and now I can clean both boxes in less time than it used to take to clean one. I use World's Best Cat Litter and have had no problems. I had read some of the reviews that mentioned the poo sticking to the grill, so I just make sure that I don't clean the box right after they have used it. My cats don't cover theirs, but the litter seems to draw out the moisture quickly so it has hardened by the time I empty the box. So far I haven't had any trouble with anything sticking to the grill. My husband always used to complain about the smell from the litter boxes and since I've been using this one we haven't noticed a smell at all. That is probably due to the fact that I am actually cleaning it every day so it never has much in it. In the past I would put it off thinking I didn't have time right then to do it. Now, I just clean it when I get home from work and it's done in less than a minute! I highly recommend this box. The little bit of litter that may spill when you are turning it is nothing compared to the litter the cats used to kick out of the other litter boxes I had. And because it is covered I don't find little ""presents"" on the floor where the cat missed the box while doing her business.

2349,"I was first introduced to Iso shampoo and conditioner fifteen years ago by a friend of mine who is a hairdresser. Eventually, she moved out of state. The real downside was that the salon she worked at was the only one nearby that sold Iso, and after she left, they stopped carrying it. I spent a few years exploring the market, trying different things, thinking Iso couldn't be all *that* great. I tried everything from stupidly expensive salon products to the cheap stuff you can find at any Walmart. Well... fifteen years later, I am, once again, living in the same city as my hairdresser friend, who reintroduced me to Iso. I will be buying this shampoo, and only this shampoo, for as long as I can get my hands on it.First off, a little goes a long way. My hair is crazy-long (hangs down past my bottom), super-thick, and naturally curly. With other shampoos, I have to use a ton of it, just to make sure my whole head of hair is washed properly. Typically, with other brands, I'll use two or three handfuls of shampoo in the course of one washing. For some reason though, one palm-full of this stuff is enough to get through all my hair. Even better, although I know the instructions say, ""lather, rinse, repeat,"" my hair feels super clean after just the first application. Sometimes I skip the ""repeat"" part of the instructions (gasp!). The end result is that I end up using less shampoo, which is easier on my budget. If that were the only advantage, it'd be enough for me. Good news for me",Pet_care

It is so nice to hear Peter and the Wolf and the Nutcracker without sounding tinny. It is actually very pleasant to listen to. Even my four-year-old enjoys it. I have several toys from Fisher-Price's sparkling symphony line that I love for a number of reasons, but they all have that mechanical sound and start to grate on your nerves after a while.

2357,"After hearing so many great things about this moisturizer for the past few years, I really wanted to try it. I actually tried it about two or three years ago and found it to be too heavy. But I think my problem was not the moisturizer but the face wash I was using. I had always thought my skin was oily, so I was constantly using products designed for oily/acne prone skin. I think I was drying my skin out, causing it to produce extra oil to compensate. Anyway, I'm now using the Olay Daily Facials for Normal skin, which work great. Up until about 3 months ago, I was using Olay Complete moisturizer for Normal skin, which was working fine but I wanted something with anti-aging properties, since I just turned 30.Since I've been using the Total Effects, I've noticed that my skin is softer. It also appears to be a little brighter. The tone is evened out some, as well. I sometimes get a little redness around my cheeks and nose. That has not completely gone away but it is diminished. I have some fine lines across my forhead that seem smaller now, especially if I moisturize before bedtime (I use the Total Effects Night Firming Cream) but more often than not, I go to bed without washing my face or moisturizing. Also, I use the Fragrance Free version (with SPF) and it truly is free of any perfumes. The only smell I get is from the SPF.I like the pump design but it is a little difficult to tell how much is left in the bottle. I have to hold it up against a light to judge the amount. One bottle has lasted me from the beginnng of August until now (Oct. 21) and there is a little left, which I expect to run out any day now, so about 3 months. I was getting about a year out of the Olay Complete bottle, which is 6 oz, so it would be nice if this came in a larger bottle.I'm very pleased with this moisturizer and will continue to use it, along with my other Olay products.",Hair_products

2360,"I'm a speech therapist and like this toy because it seems to appeal to a lot of children, even (maybe especially) my difficult to entertain kids. The motion, visuals, and mechanical factor make it a fun toy for kids on the autistic spectrum as well and, surprisingly, even my sensory-sensitive kids seem to like it despite the loudness.I just bought this toy two weeks ago, and it looks as if the company that makes it is trying to address some of the problems mentioned on this site. I noticed that on my ball popper the top portion of the tube, the place where a child would most likely get their arm stuck, snaps together and can be unsnapped if this situation occurs. It would still be possible for a child to get their arm stuck, however, if they took the top portion off or stuck it in the other hole where the balls go down the ramp. They need to have something that allows the whole front of the toy to snap off.They also seem to have made the motor stronger, as the balls in mine do not get stuck but boy, do they go flying. If I don't round them up and put them back in every single ball is gone after about 15 seconds. This is somewhat irritating but the kids seem to like chasing the balls around the room, and I've found that moving up the top (funnel) portion of the toy helps.",Kids_games

2363,"I just purchased this from a discount beauty supply yesterday and used it this morning. I have somewhat dry, color-treated hair in a neutral red shade that was fading fast. This particular color gave me the coppery deep red I like, without the weird purple tint of some other red dyes I have tried. In addition, this is the shiniest my hair has been after coloring. The smell is pleasant. I will definitely use this again, but I will do a few things differently next time because I found the product to be extremely messy. Next time I think I will shampoo and towel dry like the instructions say, but I think I will actually put the product on my hair in the shower and sit out the 25 minutes there. This stuff is very drippy and even though I was careful, I wound up with droplets here there and everywhere. I put on a clear disposable cap that helped a little, but still - very messy and that's coming from an experienced ""bathroom chemist"" who has used a lot of hair coloring.I left the product on for 25 minutes as directed and I rinsed but did not let the water run completely clear. It's a little trick I do to ""set"" the color so it lasts longer. Once I had most of the product out and the water still had a little tint still showing, I put on my regular cheapo conditioner, rinsed it out and blew my hair dry. I was pleased that the color didn't ""grab"" on the ends of my hair and make them too dark like some other products have done. So - I got a nice even tone - very shiny, soft and a vibrant copper red tone. Why haven't I heard of this stuff before? 4 stars instead of 5 because of the mess.",Pet_care

2367,"The Smasher RC Destroyer is a nice model of a Russian Souvemanney Missle curser. Remove some of the toy -like items, stick on names ,paint some of the bright silver battleship gray and you have a nice boat. The speed in the water is way to fast even for the real boat. RC batteries in the same size,but in lower voltage range can be purchased that will let this ship run at a nice scale speed. You do not have to use the built in battery charger, batteries can be charged out of the boat then installed. I always recommend atleast 2 fully charged batteries when operating so when one is used you can keep sailing. The Helix helocopter on the flight deck is the wrong scale. Should be removed, it could be replaced with one from the similar Challenger Aircraft Carrier which are the right scale. There is a Child Proof Safety feature,the boat will not run out out of the water like others will. You must have it it the water to run, or use clip lead wires between the the motors to test run out of the water. Instructions on the box fail to mention this feature.Not a bad model RC ship it is however not a kids toy,older children yes. Nate Goodman Salt Lake, Utah.",Pet_care

Matter of fact I found it to be worse because the cat did not like the intrusive gun going into the mouth. It was easier for me to have my husband hold the wrapped cat and then for me to open his mouth and lightly toss the pill in by hand. I had more control over where the pill went and then I could quickly and gently hold his mouth shut and rub his neck and cheek bone area to help get the pill down. It didn't always go this easily of course with the cat, sometimes it was a huge disaster and the pill came flying back but for the most part doing it by hand was the best.",Pet_care

2381,"We got this for my sister along with the leapster. She loves Dora so we just HAD to get this. My sister's 6 and maybe she's growing out of Dora because she tired of this game very quickly and so did I. It was too repetitive and not quite as intersting as the Sonic game we also got. So in comparison, Dora was ""borrr-ing"" as my sister said when she switched to play another game.So even if you child loves Dora, don't buy this game unless your child is under the age of 6. I think even the game was made special for kids still learning about up and down and counting and not for kids in school. It really itsn't worth it, and not very exciting. Remember to follow the age suggestions when in doubt, that helps. My sister was past the Dora game educational speaking, even if she still loved the character Dora.",Kids_games

I noticed that other people used screws but I had a hard time getting a screw in and it didn't seem to make a difference. Maybe I need to use smaller screws. Needless to say, it doesn't stay snapped together but I use it on my deck and the weight of it holds down in place. My cat does go inside and seems to like it so I guess it does what it is intended to do. I just would have liked it better if it stayed snapped into place.

I feel that I have gotten my $24.99 out of it, especially compared to the backpack that offers a lot of storage but no protection. If you want your Leapster completely protected, opt for bubblewrap.

2392,"In looking for fun games to play with our daughter, Cootie was one of those that we snatched up. Remembering playing it as a kid brings back nostalgic memories and so you just assume that it's going to live up to those memories. Sadly, Cootie does not. First off, the game can drag on and become ridiculously monotonous once you've attained all body parts except for those six legs. Rolling sixes can become rare and kids especially can become impatient and bored. Then you have the pesky problem of poor craftsmanship which leads to body parts being difficult to attach (the legs in particular have a hard time going in their intended slots all the way) or that have a hard time staying attached (the heads fall off with the slightest movement). My daughter had more fun playing with the individual Cooties than actually playing the game, and she would have had more fun had their heads stayed on while she played with them.

I picked up this figure so I would have the whole series, and because I thought the story was inside each dragon in 5 parts like last time. It is not.This dragon looks awful. The eel like head and bat type wings seem like two different dragon concepts combined, that don't match well. The coloration, with a bit of camoflage, looks okay on the back, but bad almost everywhere else. This figure has the worse piece to piece color matching of any dragon in series one or two.Mainly, the pose on this dragon is awful. The lack of articulation makes it impossible to improve. This website picture is a LITTLE better than the box shot, as they bent him down a little... giving him a sort of crawling look. Maybe that is what they were going for, and that might have been cool, but it didn't work. In reality this dragon looks like it's dancing, or stomping around in a childish Barney fashion. The one arm and leg positioned up just kill the look of this figure. Also, he's splashing in a textured mudpuddle that might have been cool... but manages to look way too much like dragon poo.This figure really stands out in the series... unfortunately because all the dragons are awesome looking, and this one is hideous and poorly sculpted.",Kids_games

2409,"I started playing video games in 1998, starting with none other than Duke Nukem 3D. Thirteen years later, I finally get my hands on a copy of Blood. I'm blown away to say the least.Blood puts you in the shoes of Caleb, a man who worshipped the evil god Tchernobog, all for the love of a girl. Tchernobog kills you all, and you rise from your grave, pitchfork in hand and quoting ""Army of Darkness"" already (I live...Again!), you are out to massacre the entire cult of Tchernobog, and the leader himself. The game has a pretty hokey story, but what do you expect from a 1990's First Person Shooter? You're playing them for the gameplay, not to hear some epic story the caliber of Mass Effect or Metal Gear Solid.Now, the gameplay. It is once again, typical 90's FPS action, but with a few things that seperates it from games like Duke Nukem 3D or Shadow Warrior. First things first, the blood. Obviously it'll have blood with a name like Blood, but the levels are off the charts here. On the walls, on the ceiling, floors, it is EVERYWHERE. Now I've played Mortal Kombat, Soldier of Fortune, etc, but Blood has some of the most extreme over the top blood/gore/violence I have ever seen in a video game, if not the most. Onto the weapons, they have to be some of the most imaginative, funny, awesome weapons I've ever used in a video game. Heck, the game's flamethrower is a lighter and an aerosol can. Yeah, it's that awesome. Some others that really stand out is the Double Barreled Shotgun, Tommy Gun, Dynamite, Tesla Cannon, and the Voodoo Doll. Also, Blood may be the first video game to introduce secondary fire modes on all weapons. So for example, hit the fire button the the double barreled shotgun, you shoot one shell. Hit the alternative fire button, fire both barrels. It's some really cool stuff.Right now, I am going to dedicate a portion of this review to the level design. It is the best I have ever played. Sure, Doom was cool. Duke Nukem 3D had some great ideas and cool levels. Dark Forces II",Kids_games

I bought it. I tested it on my little dog first and he stopped (after a louf quirk) immediatly barking ... I put the collar on the big dog, she barked a few times and stopped than, realized something is not good. It's vibrating, but it's not ""bad"" or the dog feels pain. They just really don't like it and they don't bark anymore. It worked on both dogs very fast. I just have to hold the collar now and show it to them and they stop barking. I use it from time to time and for the little one when we are not at home. It helps a lot. Would recommend it to anybody.",Pet_care

2434,"I avoided buying Leader Brawl for a long time, thinking it was just a large version of the Deluxe toy with a bunch of gimmicks added. However, I ended up being really surprised. It's like the difference between a sketch and a finished artwork. I actually ended up liking him better than Leader Optimus Prime. Big Brawl has a brilliant design and a fun (if _very_ challenging) transformation; not for novices or little kids! He's got about eight automorph gimmicks and they all work well. Except sometimes his main gun barrel doesn't make explodey sounds when you tap it in tank mode like it should, so you have to go back a step and make sure everything's alligned correctly inside the turret. As far as durability, I wouldn't throw him down the stairs, but he's reasonably solid. Don't be rough with him and there should be no problems. I gave him two stars for educational value because he's modeled after a real tank.PROS",Kids_games
2435,"Scents are often hard to review - you like the scent, you hate the scent, but how do you describe it? Well, Fahrenheit was introduced in 1988 and became a real hit. Containing bergamot, honeysuckle, hawthorn, sandalwood, nutmeg, violet, cedar, patchouli and tonka bean, it has a tea-like, delicious smell that practically makes my mouth water.I love the smell of it on my man, and when I smell it on him, it makes me want to grab him and just luxuriate in that smell. So, I guess you could say that I love it. It's not musky, or what I would call earthy - it's more flowery, but in a deeper masculine manner than women's perfume - like I said, it makes me think of a fragrant tea. Anyway, give yourself a treat, and buy your man a bottle of Fahrenheit by Christian Dior - or, give your woman a treat and buy a bottle for yourself!(Review of Dior Fahrenheit)",Perfumes

They are made of hard plastic and have replaceable watch batteries(small takes 3). The small is a little larger than a golf ball and medium is a little larger than a tennis ball. I would suggest care in choosing one large enough, I think the small could be a choking hazard for a large dog. Once my dogs start they don't quit until it rolls under the furniture and they can't get to it. It's sensitive and will activate with very little vibration, like walking by it at night.

2445,"I am a white female with very coarse, fairly curly hair. My hair stylist told me that in order for my type of hair to be straightened, the iron needed to heat up to at least 400 degrees. With all of the great reviews on this flat iron I thought I'd buy it.I prepared my hair for the best possible outcome by shampooing it with a straightening shampoo and conditioner. I followed that with a straightening product by John Freida, then blew my hair straight using a brush.It took almost 25 minutes to straighten my hair and I had to go over sections of hair more than once to achieve the effect. When all was said and done the iron did a fairly good job but my hair felt like straw. It did not feel soft nor did it look shiny as in some other reviews (and my hair is not damaged - when I dry it curly it is very healthy looking/feeling).So, I give this product 3 stars solely for being able to do the job. However I won't be using this iron very much because of the way it makes my hair feel. For those who have fine to medium hair, this would probably work well for you.

After 2 weeks, the collar stopped working.I contacted the manufacturer who asked me to take some trouble shooting steps and, when it still did not work, they authorized the return of the product. The return was at my expense but I did receive a replacement in about 2 weeks. I will say that Innotek's customer service was very good. I received the replacement collar and for 2 weeks it worked perfectly and was effective in stopping the excessive barking.Unfortunately, once again it has stopped working and will not spray.

I don't know how much he uses it, but here is my experience with the game.The wireless controls seem to work fine. Setup is very easy, and the game runs fine. The graphics are very subpar, so don't expect anything you couldn't see on an original nintendo. The games are plentiful, but like any casino game, the winning is put in your favor, so that you continue to play. You quickly become a billionaire in this game, since the competition is very easy. It would have been nice if the game had a better difficulty setting, and offered more realistic challanges (optional). The AI seems pretty stupid, and can bet all their money on a king high or fold on a triple Ace.I guess the game is good for someone who knows nothing about computers and technology, yet you want to expose them to gaming and they like poker. That is really the only reason. I did not feel passionate about this game, as said, it is simply OK.I gave it a 4, because you can't get it having high expectations, and it meets everything you would expect from this game.

VPs represent that contribution.Each turn has three major phases:- In the first phase, you allocate your workers to producing various resources. You may also hire craftsmen during the phase.- In the second phase, you allocate your master builder tokens to various tasks and functions. You are limited to three tokens so you must choose wisely. Also the other players are competing for the same tasks and functions.- The third phase is mechanical and represents the actual actions you planned in the first and second phase. Once you learn the game, the third phase resolves very quickly.I really like the way the game captures the feel of the book. Also, for an economic and production game, it plays very quickly once you become familiar with the turn flow. The component are of a very good quality.The only thing I don't care for the randomness in allocating master builder tokens.

2497,"I don't ever write reviews, but I had to here! I have used many flat irons over the years, this one is the absolute best. A friend loaned me hers and I had to have one. A good thing after reading the many reviews here, they would have probably scared me off. I have very thin hair, but soooo much of it that it looks really thick. It is VERY wavy, without being curly at all, so I have to either flat iron it or curl it or it won't look done. Curling is a bad idea, for not only is it very drying but it doesn't hold very well in my hair, falling to waves again in less than an hour (even in the winter). Flat Ironing works much better.Okay, so I know the routine of patience, pull the flat iron slowly, use a heat protecting pretreatment, and all that, but with other irons (including a Chi), they just didn't make it look like my stylist makes it look. Which I knew meant that it had to be the iron, for I was using the same products that she was. Her flat iron runs about $600, great for her in her line of work, much too costly for my budget, there just simply has to be a better solution than that.By the way, my stylist said, ""NEVER EVER put any hot styling tool to your hair unless it is absolutely positively dry, or you will ruin your hair over time, causing it to break and split, so I always either use a blow dryer or let my hair air dry (often overnight) before using a hot iron on it.Finally an iron that gets warm enough that if done slowly like you're supposed to, only takes one swipe over the hair, to straighten it. Even my stylist has to make two or three swipes! Better yet, it holds real well in the high humid temperatures found in the St Louis Metro area and this is the warmest summer on record.All that said, I love the iron, its cord is long enough that I don't have to stand on top of the outlet, the outside doesn't get so hot that I can't touch it, it doesn't catch my hair and break it off at the plate edges. It makes my hair feel silky smooth and everyone comments on how healthy my hair looks. All of that with using a tool that heats to 410 degrees, wow! I am thrilled! Enough Said! My T3 Tourmaline Model 83922, will be my last flat iron ever!I have been using a T3 for about 6 months now with no problems to the unit or my hair. It heats up VERY quickly, so I don't need to leave it on for any length of time at all before actually using it, plugging it in just a minute or two before use. I would think with any unit that gets this hot, you might experience trouble over time with it burning itself out if left on for extended periods of time. Not to mention the damage it might do to your bathroom counter. No need here, it really does heat up quickly.Welcome to the world of wonderful comments on your hair, and enjoy your new T3 Tourmaline,Terri",Pet_care

There is nothing on the packaging that states ""new formula"". I noticed a change when I opened the package...different color of kibble. I checked the ingredients llisted on the back and compared to an outdated brochure from the company. I thought that the new formula would be OK. I haven't had the severity of problems that others have had, but after reading several postings at different sites, I susupect that the changes I have observed in my senior golden in the last month or so has to be the food!

2501,"I purchased this for my daughter as a Christmas gift. The packaging indicates you use 'ordinary' household sugar. The instructions INSIDE the packaging emphasize that you must use FINE sugar which is 4x (not powdered and table sugar). After searching for 2 weeks trying to find FINE sugar, I finally found some. Eager to try the unit out, I discovered that the electrical cord had pulled out of the plug that attaches to the base unit. We're lucky we didn't start a fire. I soldered the loose wire back onto the plug and made ready for another attempt. In great anticipation, the cotten candy maker did make cotten candy ... about 4-5 strands. What a disappointment. Fortunately, I decided to try this when my daughter was not present in order to avoid creating another 'Are you ready? Here goes! ... I'm sorry honey' scene.

2503,"I purchased this game for my 12 year old son who is an Apprentice addict. Our general impression is that the game is fun, though we haven't owned it for very long so I don't know what the longevity will be on this opinion...The game comes with a card scanner unit and 3 decks of cards - competitor, task, and earnings. Players divide into 2 teams and choose 6 competitor cards which show a picture of the competitor and bars indicating that person's strength in given areas like sales & marketing, education, creativity, etc. Each team scans the cards in the machine and the game begins. A task card is chosen (create and operate a casino game, sell bottled water, etc.) and teams must pick 3 of the competitor cards to challenge the other team. Donald's voice tells a skill which is important to complete this task and each team picks a competitor card to scan. Donald then tells which competitor had the higher rating in that skill and tells how many earnings cards to distribute to each team. 2 more skills are then specified and teams choose which players to scan for these as well. More earnings cards are distributed according to what the skill levels were. At the end of the round, teams add up their earnings cards and the team with the lowest number results in a competitor getting fired. The game continues until there are 2 competitors left and one is chosen by Donald to be the winner.Things I didn't like about the game:1) there is no volume control and level seems quite loud2) the game takes about 1/2 hour to play and there is no way to save it in the middle of a game - the unit will shut off automatically after 5 minutes of non-use3) batteries not included4) each time you start the game, Donald's voice proclaims that this is the best game ever made (not quite...)Things I do like about the game:1) the game makes you think about what skills will be important to do well in a given task - you pick which of your competitors will compete in the task based on your conclusions2) swiping the cards in the machine is fun",Kids_games
2504,"Good - What it isThis is a quick protein boost for your hair that you can use fairly often. If you're experiencing mild breakage, this is a way to get your hair into shape quickly. If you are experiencing moderate breakage, using this on a schedule is a great way to gradually improve the quality of your hair without accidentally overdoing it. Furthermore, plenty of people use this without following up with a DC and retain softness. I personally have never done protein without a moisture DC immediately after, so I can't comment on that.Bad - What it isn'tIf you want a quick MEDIUM/LARGE protein boost, you're better off using ORS Mayo or perhaps that 2 Step. I've seen what the 2 step can do to people, so I won't be trying it. At any rate, I would recommend this to anyone who sometimes needs more protein in their hair diet, which is quite a lot of people.",Pet_care

2509,"I received the first jug as a gift for my golden retriever (80 lb.), then bought a second one when I picked up a Wheaten terrier (30 lb). Both dogs enjoy working their breakfast kibble out of the jug. The Wheaten will eat until full and the retriever, true to his nature, can't stop eating and playing. They are able to almost completely empty the jugs. Their size difference changes their strategies a bit but doesn't affect their ability to play.When first introducing the toy to the dogs, I ""primed"" the jug by spilling out a couple high-value treats mixed with kibble (later moving to only kibble). The rope knot inside the jug can also block the entrance, so I was careful to make sure that the knot was well inside the jug. And I made sure to fill the jug about 3/4 full because the jug can clog if it's totally full and I didn't want them to be discouraged if it was too unrewarding. Now the dogs are more experienced, so I don't prime the jugs anymore. I am increasing the challenge by sitting the jugs upright and will soon be moving to asking them to find the jug.The container is easy to fill but the cloth rope makes cleaning a little more difficult. My Wheaten uses the rope to retrieve the jug from under the coffee table but I'm still considering removing the rope because of hygiene and because it blocks the jug opening.I recommend this if you have dogs cooped up indoors, if you have dogs that need to keep themselves occupied, and especially for large-chested breeds who gulp down their food (because the jug forces the dog to literally only eat a couple kibble at a time).",Pet_care

2513,"After tiring of taking plastic grocery bags filled with kitty peeps and poops out to the garbage every day, I finally decided to give the litter locker a try. Before it arrived, I was already regretting my itchy buy finger and the purchase thinking that it was really a glorified plastic shopping bag. I mean, after all, I double and triple up on the plastic bags, twist and knot them after a scooping. Really, how much better would this glorified grocery bag be? Boy was I wrong! I cannot believe how the smell in my little closet where I keep the litter box has decreased - and I didn't think it was that bad in the first place!Also, after owning (or being owned) by three cats for several years, cleaning up cat pee, poop, puke, hairballs and even dead rodent gifts didn't even gross me out anymore. I was very, very surprised to find how pleasant it is to not actually have to touch the poops and peeps anymore - another benefit of the litter locker that I wasn't even looking for when I bought it.Finally the litter locker has helped reduce litter scatter in my house. The litter box is in the corner. In essence, enclosed on two sides. But, my cats would jump over the side of the box on the open side scattering litter all over refusing to politely exit at the front of the box where I'd set a litter mat. I now keep the litter locker along the open side the cats would previously jump over forcing them to exit onto the litter mat.Only drawback is now that I'm sold on the litter locker, I need to shell out more money to buy 2 more of the gadgets for the other litter boxes in my house.",Pet_care

2569,"I have read the previous reviews and agree with almost ALL of them basically, the good and the bad. I've had mine for about 9 months. I've experienced the poopy water that would not drain and the unbelievably annoying beeps. I've experienced the olfactory experience of blown-dry poop with hint of perfume on many occasions. (I automatically start my bathroom fan running when I start the CatGenie) That is quite unlike any other bodily experience I have even had. The poopy water experience at, say, 2 am, is quite life-changing too while your cats are pacing feverishly to use the unusable litter box. I have three cats and all of them adjusted to it perfectly. None of them is freaked out by the horrific noise it makes while churning and disposing of cat poop. In fact, they often like to watch it in action. One in particular loves lying on top of the domed-cover (tuxedo package) while it blow dries because it's so warm. During my first non-draining water experience I called Petnovation's toll free number in desperation. The young tech support fellow was as patient and kind as I was not. He walked me through one test after another until the problem was identified. In truth I had precipitated the problem by overfilling the bowl with the granules and the water sensor got dirty as a result. Mea culpa.Since then things have been pretty good - the occasional need to clean the water sensor or remove a cat hair plug from the drain. I've learned to live with all of that for the sheer convenience of not having to lug 40 pound pails of cat litter in (and many more pounds of it used OUT)But what impressed me most is the company! First their tech support was wonderful! And most recently they engineered an improved hopper system to reduce (eliminate) cat hair plugs and water sensor problems. But what is so amazing to me is that, no questions asked, they will send it to you for 1 cent plus $5 shipping (no shipping charge at all if you're ordering other supplies). It practically reinvents the process but at virtually no cost they send you the upgrade! Just log on to their website. Now THAT is loyalty to your customers! Cheers Petnovations!PS",Pet_care
2570,"Many years ago, I was browsing through Sacks Fifth Ave., looking for a fresh, spring/summer scent that would suit me. The saleswoman was extremely helpful, and spent some time discussing various perfumes with me, as well as spritzing different paper strips with sample scent, rather than my arm. I preferred light, transparent woodsy scents - subtle. Chanel had just launched a new perfume, in 1974, which combined the fresh, fruity tang of lemon from Italy, light spring floral notes of Honeysuckle and Water Hyacinth, and pulled it all together with the woodsy charm of Vetiver and oakmoss.Vetiver has a delightful smoky woodsy fragrance which is frequently blended with geranium and jasmine. It is a tall, dense, wild grass with long narrow leaves and a strand of underground white, yellow and brown roots and is sought after for its calming, protective, soothing and uplifting characteristics. Vetiver can be found in Java, Haiti, Japan, Indonesia and South India.I find it goes deliciously well with the above ingredients and leaves one feeling clean, fresh, intimate and very sexy. There is no astringent smell or feel to Cristalle, unlike many ""fresh scents,"" nor is it too heady or heavy. Cristalle is a stimulating fragrance and an excellent perfume for day wear, especially in warm weather and for sports. I also wear it on warm evenings as I prefer the crisp, woodsy scent to the sweeter flowery ones in the heat. Because it is so subtle, it is ideal for the workplace also, used sparingly.Chanel relaunched Cristalle in 1993 with a richer floral blend in the eau de parfum concentration with a slightly fruiter chypre base. The changes did not impact my opinion at all. It is still an outstanding fragrance, one of my very few favorites.I have worn ""Cristalle"" for thirty years now, and it has carried me through various life phases beautifully and smoothly. An absolute feel good perfume! ENJOY!PS - I just noted that one of the other reviewers mentions that Chris Noth (""Law & Order,"" ""Sex in the City""), is Wowed by Cristalle! Makes sense, I am Wowed by Chris Noth!!JANA",Perfumes
2571,I installed this door into the side of my storage building which has wall about 0.5 inches think. It worked well with that. The door had a detent around the frame insert edge for bending and breaking off a section of the insert so that it could be fitted in a thin wall like I did. It did take quite a bit of force with pliers to bend and break off that portion of the frame.I would buy again knowing what I know now.,Pet_care
2572,"Growing up, my family always loved playing games, so now that I am starting a family of my own, I've been collecting old favorites for my own ""game library."" The Game of Life was one of the first games I purchased, but I could not have been more disappointed in the quality of the ""new and improved"" game.The game I grew up with had the buildings, bridges, houses, etc. permanently embedded into the game board. With the new game, these 3D decorations come off and and have to be placed on the board each time you play. This is my main complaint with the new game. Every time you accidently knock the board or brush one of the buildings with your sleeve, they fall off. Add to this the age-old problems of people not staying in the cars and the spinner not working properly (it's worse in the new game, by the way) and The Game of Life becomes a game of frustration.After one game with the new game board, our family decided we would not play the game again. I am now looking on auction sites trying to find one of the ""old fashioned"" game boards. They really took a step backwards with this one.",Kids_games

2582,"Hate to admit it, but my cat is getting way up there in age, and decided that the litter box was a little too inconvenient to use, and used the corner of the living room to do the number 1. Well, I cleaned that up, but a few days later, she decided to use the bedroom closet to leave another liquid gift. That cat now lives outside.LITERALLY hours of soaking, scrubbing, chemicals, the ""vinegar and baking soda"" trick later, the stain seemed to be gone, but a day or two later, THAT ODOR would return. More scrubbing, soaking, etc, and that would cure the problem for two days or so, but THAT ODOR would return again. I was ready to literally cut out areas of carpet.I found Simple Solution recommended on another web site, so I came to Amazon, and ordered some. Used it in the living room, ONCE, (thoroughly soaking the problem area, down to the pad -- that's important) and let it dry by itself.... no blotting. It's been three weeks and there is NO ODOR left, even with the nose to the carpet method. It's been one week for the bedroom closet, and I mean NO SMELL is left behind, other than a slight, slight, perfume smell from the Simple Solution. I have since vacuumed and steam cleaned the areas, hoping that the agitation wouldn't ""wake up"" the cat odors. They didn't, and I couldn't be more happier.The only thing I changed, was that I emptied a bottle of the Scrubbing Bubbles battery operated spray bottles, rinsed it out, and put the Simple Solution in it, so I wouldn't have to squeeze the spray trigger two thousand times to saturate the soiled area.",Pet_care

She can't get her teeth around it, so normally she doesn't want anything to do with it. This would probably be a fun ball for outside in the grass if I had gotten the smaller version.

2588,"I had done quite a bit of reading and came across some chatter about this horse/pet product causing wonderful results on humans. This conditioner is marketed as a regrowth/rebuilder/repairer for animals' coats, skin, hoofs, paws. The claims of human hair regrowth/thickening were what interested me. There are quite a few comparisons to a similar product, Ovation Cell Therapy that is purported to be more expensive w/ similar or same ingredients. I have not tried Ovation nor have I bothered to do an ingredient comparison, but I can tell you that Ovation's manufacturer (DH Labs) = its parent company is EQyss - the company that makes Mega-Tek.I have ordered from Amazon (twice - got the small 2 oz size first to try, loved so much, went back and ordered the 16 fl oz full size.)Instructions are to apply as a conditioner, leave on for 5 min and then rinse out. I have used on a daily basis for a month and I LOVE it! Its white consistency is a little thicker than my ordinary daily conditioner, but not as thick as a deep conditioner. It has a light almost tropical scent.I started by using as an all over conditioner, which was great, but since no one can re-grow hair at the ends, and due to the expense, I have been using on only my scalp for the past few weeks and then letting the rinsing action coat the rest of my hair like a normal conditioner.I see less hair coming out when I rinse my hair and less on my hairbrush when styling. I can't speak to regrowth (I have a LOT of hair, but it is VERY fine, so I can't tell if there is regrowth) , but I can say it certainly does make my fine, color-treated layered bobbed hair look/feel thicker, fuller and like there is more of it and the effect, once I style and spray hairspray, lasts all day!From my bottle",Pet_care

2591,"It's not perfect. My long-haired collie still barks but it's certainly better with the collar than without. It also seems to work better when she has a summer hair cut as the metal probes can reach her skin more easily.The other drawback of this collar is that the on/off/setting button is ANNOYING. Older models had a dial you could turn. On this model, you push and hold a little button for 2-3 seconds, let go, and the setting changes. For example, to change from correction level 1 to 2, you have to press and hold the button for 2-3 sec, then let go. If you want correction level 3, you have to do it again. After correction level 3, pressing the button and releasing takes you to Test mode. Then you can press it again to turn it off. Cycling through all of these settings is slow and frustrating, especially since you might release the button too soon (setting doesn't change) or you might hold it in too long.TIP:I have discovered a trick that I'm not sure is explained in the instructions. You can avoid cycling through all of these levels if e.g., your dog always needs correction level 3. When you're ready to turn the collar off, press and keep holding the button until you see if flash green, and then red (do NOT let go after it flashes green). When it flashes red, the unit is off. To turn it back on, press the button twice, and it will automatically take you back to the level you used last. [If I hadn't discovered this 'feature' of the collar, I think I would have given up on it a long time ago.]OVERALL:I would still buy this collar. I trust the brand in terms of my pet's safety. I just wish it were more effective at curbing the barking and that it weren't so annoying to use.",Pet_care
2592,"I started using Bella B Tummy Honey Butter when I was around 30 weeks pregnant (with twins). I previously used Palmers Tummy Butter, but couldn't find it in stores anymore. When looking for it online, I came across this and after reading all the positive reviews decided to give it a try. I was having a lot of problems with itching. I can honestly say it hasn't offered relief for me personally from that standpoint. I since have begun having problems with my entire body itching and can't seem to get much relief. I've tried many different topical products to no avail. My OB says it is due to hormones and since I am allergic to benadryl there really isn't anything that is safe for both me and the boys to try. So, I won't blame this product for not getting rid of the itch problem. Anyway, I slather this on very liberally every night. It is not ""non-greasy"". I wear a cotton camisole to bed each night so as not to make a mess of my sheets. It does seem to soak into my hands rather quickly, though. A tub will last me right at two weeks. The first two tubs I bought (in my first shipment) the texture was a bit gritty, but not in a rough, scratchy, irritating way. The third tub that I have begun using (different shipment) is not gritty, but rather very smooth. At 35 weeks pregnant now with just over 11 lbs of babies in me, my belly has really blossomed.

Also, I color my hair with semi-permanent coloring, and the now frizzy ends absorb more of the coloring, giving a strange look.

2640,"I moved back home to my mothers place of residence Wed September 1, 2010 and she has two cats and a dog, I have one cat. My cat at the time was pregnant, she had her kittens Tuesday Sept 7, 2010. I kept my cat in my room a few days so she could calm down and get use to the move. Finally, I let her roam the house and she was fine until she came in contact with the dog. She growled and hissed, attacked and then ran, the dog didn't back down but also did not bark, scratch or bite. The next day she was lying close to the dog with no problem. The morning after, Sept 5, 2010 my dog was put to sleep. The only ones left were the cats. Unfortunately, unlike the dog after she encountered the cats she didn't become friends after they growled and snapped at each other. Actually, after she had her kittens she even started to bully one cat. She would seek him out and attack. It has gotten to the point where the other cats are afraid to eat or roam around the house. I just got the bottle of At ease Thur Sept 9, 2010. My mother and I lost sleep over the random attacks from my cat in the middle of the night. I sprayed it everywhere. I was hoping it would relax them enough to where they can at least not attack each other. It did not work for my cat at all. So, she is now confined to my room.The reason why I gave it an two stars is because one cat is a scaredy cat. The funny thing about him is he is a main coon (in other words huge) yet he hides. Since I sprayed, ""At Ease"", he doesn't run from my cat anymore. He hid majority of the time and only came out to eat and as soon as he heard my door open, he would disappear. Once I sprayed, ""At Ease"", he stopped hiding and was acting like normal. He still growls at my cat, when she growls at him but he isn't in hiding anymore. Too bad I can't get the one she picks on, out of hiding and he is the friendly cat, who loves everybody.Since, it has only been a day for me, I am still going to continue using and update my review if there is any changes. I am thinking maybe the cats were so stressed from the loss of my dog and the cat fights and new kittens that maybe the, ""At Ease"" isn't strong enough to calm them down at this time. I will see...It is Sept 19, 2010 and I sprayed the At Ease all over the house for a few more days to see if there were any difference. I stopped using it because it seemed pointless. The main coon still picks up for myself so it is uncertain if it were from the spray or just him having enough of her taking over.",Pet_care

The music was mediocre in quality, and didn't seem to sooth my baby. He liked to hit all the buttons on it, so regardless of the music duration, it was always off long before that. The thing I hated the most was the remote. Unless your nursery is the size of a barn, I'm not sure why you would want a remote. It's just another piece of junk that takes AA batteries and clutters up a tabletop. That kind of poor engineering is just a waste of money.I've had this product for 3 years now. Our second child has actually used it far more heavily than our first did. He turns it on each morning and listens to it on his own for a while before fully waking up.

A couple of small issues, try to not drop anything on the plastic reservoir on back as I found out the hard way that if it has a deep crack in it, it will cause your fountain to overflow all the time and you'll have to purchase a new one off of the Drinkwell website which are about $20 to replace.

My dog stopped barking the first time it sprayed her, she let out one bark, she was sprayed and stopped barking.

Im sure this will still be a work in progress and I do not plan on stopping the training collar, however it makes a big difference !A second problem I have is walking him, he wants to be out in front and pulling you down the road or trail, I was able to walk a trail for the first time with out a sore arm while using this collar after one shock and several audio alerts he was learning to stay close and not pull.I will also say that I am only using the second level of shock out of eight, and it is plenty to get his attention.If you have a hard headed dog or one with bad habits spend the money for one of these !",Pet_care

I do not know what the notes are supposed to be, but, upon spraying on my skin, the first thing I smelled was what smelled like a mixture of verbena and lime.

Most of YSL's perfumes disappear from my skin in mach speed, but Baby Doll Paris is very long lasting. It also smells good on fabric. Though, I don't believe this is really original smelling, it is good in a very girly casual sort of way.Babydoll isn't bottleworthy for me, as I have other similiar scents which have a sexier feel that I like better.

He would cry....then go on my comforter.He never figured out how to stand on it. Always went backwards or sideways.The manufacturer has a great website with many videos of cats doing their business on it. I think it just depends on the cat.I just think that trying to force a cat to do his business within a 8"" x 5"" oval is just too stressful for them. Plus, if your cat likes to diligently cover up his business when he's done, he won't like this. Mine would step down and try to reach into the hole to cover up his pee, but couldnt really get the job done. He was confused and tried and tried.By the way, this entire box is the size of your own toilet lid! It's quite compact and snazzy looking. I really think it would be absolutely PERFECT to train a kitten on this. The kitten would be small, and wouldnt mind the small area to use. But trying to get my 1 year old to ""downsize"" just wouldnt work.The actual area to put litter was about 12"" x 10"". So you will use very little litter. I'm thinking it's a must to use clumping litter with this box, though, because the ""pan"" part is so small, theres no room for scraping and foraging without getting litter everywhere.

So I decided to give the CatStop a go first (the same model is used as a small animal deterrent elsewhere on Amazon).The first thing I noticed was that the sensor isn't very sensitive. After the first blast it takes a while before it resets for a second blast. In the 10 - 15 secs it takes for that to happen, the rabbits have already set up shop 2 ft in front of the CatStop and started to do their business on my lawn. I don't know what rabbits elsewhere do but the ones here stay absolutely still until they're done doing whatever it is that they're doing. Which typically includes nibbling on my grass, pooping on it and then killing it their pee.The entrance to my yard is about 10 ft wide.

Maybe that was just really bad luck but we had to restart twice (that would've sucked alot more if it happened in one of the later rounds. There aren't any options for replacing a question.Beyond that is the quality of the questions (some of the ""responses"" left all of us completely bambozeled - it was hard to believe that actual human beings answered the questions). A completely different experience from the show where the questions are logical and have mostly logical responses.Lastly I would like to say that we bought this after dusting off a 20 year old version of family feud which we had a blast playing despite the age of some of the questions (we just tossed the outdated questions aside).

Eliminating the need for fabric softeners is a big benefit.These will save money and will pay for themselves in a relatively short period of time. Further, you are not adding unnecessary chemicals to the environment. Plus you will be using less gas/electric, thus reducing the pollution you create.This product is highly recommended.Caution, the shipping charge on these plastic balls is very high. You can likely find the same product locally for much less. Try your local dollar store before ordering online.",Pet_care
2702,"I love everything about this lotion. It has a lovely, addictive smell, it's vegetarian and not tested animals (VERY important to me), it's paraben free (paraben being a cancer-causing chemical), and the alpha hydroxy acids work wonders for keratosis.I just purchased this lotion in the last month, and the bottle says ""New Improved Hydration"" in the upper left. I'm very happy with it.",Hair_products

Overall, good product which is effident buy this being his third identical dryer over probably 5+ years.",Pet_care
2708,"The product has a very bad description, so I though I need to write some details. It does not specify the size, but great that they say it's 100% natural.So, it smells bad and looks very small, but my dog loves it! Maybe it's just small for my 100 lbs Cane Corso... On the back of the pack it says to give 2-3 stix a day for dogs that size. Each stick is about 5 in long and 1/2 in diameter. They are very hard, but my dog does not have any problems chewing it. It goes away in about 1 min. When he fells that he is going to get it, he starts ""dancing"".I cannot say anything about its function, my dog only got stix few times. But he likes them even though they have a terrible smell. I would buy again.",Hair_products

It's not my dog's favorite toy but when I smear a teaspoon of peanut butter or cream cheese in it, he loves it to pieces.He is a very aggressive chewer and the Kongs hold up to his King Kong jaws but I don't think he's a big hard rubber fan.

I usually wear scents that are warm, spicy, and sexy. Light and floral is usually not something I find interesting.This perfume is completely different. According to one website, it is ""A distinctive blend of rare gingerlily with citrus, rich florals, sandalwood, musk and blackcurrant"".All I know is that I have never smelled someone else wearing it and it is an absolutely lovely scent. Every time I wear it someone asks me about the cologne I'm wearing. Hubby is also a fan.The scent is classic but not the type of classic that makes you smell like your grandmother's dressing table.",Perfumes
2720,"I got this game for my birthday, and i have to give it an over all score of 4 stars. You see, the title basically describes the game, you create your dream life. You design your girl and her best friend, and your room. Then you can explore the town. You have to go school every day and study for tests and do homework. The better you do in school, the cooler things your parents let you buy. There's the rec center were you can sign up for activies. And then there's the mall! There you can buy shoes, clothes, and things for your room.I'll tell you, this game defantly has it's ups and downs. It's good things are that it teaches you how to save money, for the more you have, the cooler things you can buy. It also teaches you responsiblity, for to earn money you have to work (all though work in this game is just pushing a button). You also need to manage time, so that you can fit in studying, talking and shopping.But, this game deffantly had some downs. You see, this game can get boring after a while, for you're always doing the same thing. Also, really, there isn't much to do. Really, the only thing you can do is shop. Sure that is really fun, but it's always the same clothes. You never get to see anything new.This game is great for the preteen in the family.",Kids_games

Great for dry skin due to hot showering! Highly recommend it! Absorbs within 15 minutes w/o greasy feel, just a nice satiny smooth skin.",Hair_products

2724,"I love this shampoo. I invested in some Nioxin after lots of people suggested it, and I couldn't tell much of a difference, but I always figure buying shampoos to make a huge difference on your hair was a bit of a crapshoot anyway, so I didn't hold it against Nioxin. But then on a whim I bought some of this at the grocery store last month, and I swear I can tell a difference. I lost a lot of hair due to poor diet and high stress (paired with significant weight loss) at the end of the summer, and for the first part of the fall I was so insecure and self conscious about my hair. I've tried to keep up with some vitamins and have been eating a lot better, so I'm sure that plays a part in the change in my hair, but I swear this shampoo has also made a difference when no other shampoo ever has before. My hair is babyfine and flat and losing ANY of it was frustrating. It really does feel thicker now.",Pet_care
2725,"This stuff is great. It smells nice (lavender scent) and it works really well. I usually put it on my hands before I go to bed, and I put it on my nails after I remove nail polish (since nail polish remover is drying). The one drawback is that it's a bit on the oily side (it doesn't sink in right away) and that's why I use it prior to going to bed. Probably one of the best products by Burt's Bees, and one tin lasts for a really long time.",Perfumes
2726,"This is a tale of one dog and two cats... The dog (a Corgi) was the devil essentially. We got her as a puppy a year ago, and thought that she would learn to play nice with our cats that are 14 and 3 years old. As time went by, things got progressively worse, to the point where the cats were always locked in the computer room for their own protection. It got to the point where something had to give; we were contemplating giving up our dog. As a last resort I brought this home on March 24, 2009. We put it one her that night and four zaps later, her and the 14 year old were sitting quietly together on the living room floor and the door hasn't been shut since! Today is April 5; it hasn't even been two weeks since we started her on this training.Definitely worth the money, but I suggest you by it here as you will pay approximately $60-70 more at PetCo or PetSmart (which is what I did).Only complaint is that the batteries run out pretty fast and you have to push down really hard on the shock button to have it transmit. Either way, it is still worth the money as my dog can now stay. And my cats can now be a part of the family again.",Pet_care

My son didn't throw it on the floor or anything so I couldn't figure out why the sounds stopped working (and really even if he did throw it on the floor--they should make toys made for 1-4 year olds more durable!). We changed the batteries but they still wouldn't work. My son still played with the farm but he was disappointed that the sounds wouldn't work. Well I contacted customer service thinking maybe I could get another part for the sounds but they sent us a BRAND NEW FARM!! Wow!!! Awesome customer service!

It seems that most are created as intellectual endeavors (not why I play games) or mindless pastimes (usually not why I play games). The most interesting kind of games, of which Bang! is a good example, is social games. The kind that you can use to make new friends or get more out of your old ones (until you trade them in for store credit).Yeah it's terribly educational.

2739,"If you like murder mystery games, this one goes far beyond Clue. Be the first to get the correct answers to score the most points. This is a great game for a group of people or for just three. It is similar to Clue in concept but without the board. It is also more involved because you try to discover more information (such as time of day, location, murderer, motive, etc.) Even when it is not your turn, you can pick up information from noticing not only other players questions and answers, but which players are asking and answering. As in Clue, one person announces when they decide they have figured everything out. But, in Alibi, everyone then makes their best guesses and everyone may earn some points. It can be an addictive game and I have yet to find someone who has played that did not like it. It is small enough to be easily carried and interesting enough for any group of people. Also, it can be adapted to different types of players. Use a simpler version with children and a more complicated version with more sophisticated players. If you like games, this would be an excellent addition to your collection.",Kids_games

The ""table"" part is heavy and if it hits my daughter, it wouldn't be pretty.Just look at the legs- they go straight down whereas the leap frog table's legs bulge out for more balance and stability.

Problem is, this one is made of hard plastic and using it feels like scraping my head with a comb. The little spikes could stand to be a bit more pliable and a little less abrasive on the scalp.

From the reviews of Skywarp or Thundercracker, Skywarps wings don't hug the body tightly, this is true, but who cares? If you do, sorry about that. One useless detail about G1 is that the characters on the show and the toy can be very different. But I guess you must make some sacrifices.Back to the wings, The wings look like right triangles with an edge cut off and O.75 in stub added. To be quite honest they make him look fat, but you can slide his wings back to make them LOOK thinner. Also, Skywie's head is a little small and with this 1.25 in cone sticking out of the back of his head. If that cone was orange, he'd be perfect for a protectobot, shooing the traffic away from a disaster. Anyway, Skywarp's arms are a little thin, but the fists and blasters make up for it.

I have a few phasers, a Klingon knife, a tricorder, and a couple of communicators, but this phaser/communicator combo from Art Asylum is really very nice. The sculpting is adequate on both items, but what makes these special is the use of light. The communicator is a simple device with a sound chip, but the lighted screen is a nice touch. The classic communicator with the recorder in it was nicely done, and is better than this communicator by far, but still, this is a nice rendition. The phaser has a light at the end when you pull the trigger, as expected, but it was a pleasant surprise to plug in the toy power cell and have it light up! That was really nice. I don't like the orange tip on the gun, but that can't be helped. I'm going to paint mine.

2775,"Before I purchased this item, I saw one in the store that had its wing broken off at the ball joint. I was a little concerned about how it would hold up for my 3-year-old, but thought it probably broke because some kid was a little over zealous at the store. Not so. My son didn't have this toy out of the package more than an hour, when I found it on the floor with one wing out of it's socket, and the other one broken at the ball joint. I'm going to exchange it, but if it happens again, he'll have a one-winged dragon, and he'll be making up creative stories about how it came to be so mamed.",Kids_games
2776,"Nice fountain, but... very strange though - their packing QA must be a little bad. For some reason my box included a partially filled package from the Drinkwell Aqua Garden kit. It had the seed basket clip and the instructions, but no seeds or basket. Other than that, it works as advertised. Highly recommended for cats and small dogs - it truly encourages them to drink more.",Pet_care
2777,"This is a nice Spiderman figure. Even though he looks too skinny and the webbing on his costume looks too close together when compared to other ToyBiz Spiderman figures, it has other redeeming qualities. This figure has decent--and more useful--articulation than most figures. Head, neck, shoulders, arms, elbows, mid forearms, waist, hips, knees, mid-shin, and ankles all bend and/or rotate. It has an interchangeable head so that you can pose him with a Peter Parker head so it seems as if he has taken off his mask for a little fresh air. He has two fists instead of the overused ""web shooting"" pose. Personally, I think this is wonderful. Spidey can finally trade punches with the bad guys instead of spin webs all the time. Also, the joint at the waist only turns far enough to the left or the right to allow the spring action inside to work and make it look like Spidey is throwing a punch. Again, I think this is great. All the other Spiderman action figures we have bought have this joint and it turns the figure all the way around 360 degrees. No one can do that in real life. Not to mention that it is also the first joint that gets loose and his body will twist and turn around even when you don't want him to. The accessory is OK. The Shocker can be ""trapped"" to the wall that he is permanently attached to by ""punching"" him. The webbing that traps him doesn't always wrap around the Shocker every time it is activated. Only the Shocker's head moves, unfortunately. It would have been real nice to have him as a separate action figure, though. Or, they could have made it a 2-in-1 action figure pack. A good product for kids.",Kids_games

2784,This product does what it says it will do. I think the product probably works best for people with min to mod hair loss. You can see the product on your scalp in the right lighting close up. The product will rub off in your hands so you should use hair spray to help hold it in place. I have balding in front and crown. I'm a 43 year old male. Matching the right hair color is essential. I use a combination of med brown and light brown. I found it helped even the color out best for me. I no it isn't that detectable because I work with very honest people and if they had detected it they would have commented. One person I work with noticed something different and commented my hair looked thicker but he couldn't detect the product. I can tell it's there I guess because I know it is and to me the product just covers your scalp. Thats why I think it works best for people with min to mod hair loss. This product would be very apparent if you have hardly no hair. It is fairly easy to use and you do have to clean up the bathroom counter top after application. I also have to wipe and shape up my forehead after application. I bought the spray applicator and it does help for the front of the hair line.,Pet_care

2794,"I had seen this cat litter at a kiosk at the Pet Expo in Del Mar, CA and had noticed how wonderful it smells. The litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. The sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the Florida company that produces Feline Pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the South.I tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. It is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. Any ""dust"" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.As the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. I suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. The sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily ""stirring"", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.The only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don't dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. The bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but I think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. The packaging also says ""CHEMICAL FREE..."" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. H2O (water) is a chemical. It should read ""HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL FREE"" or ""BIOTOXIN FREE"".Anyway, I'll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. Now that I've tried a premium litter, I'll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best.",Pet_care

2809,"My daughters, Scooby-Doo fans both (age 6,) wanted this for Christmas. I found it on sale so snapped it up, intrigued by the 3D design. It's very cute. A little tricky to figure out how to assemble at first. The pictures are tiny and the diagram letters don't match up with the piece numbers. But I'm usually good at that kind of thing so I figured it out. But then I couldn't get the cage to stay up, not realizing that it would once I pushed the ghost down to ""set"" the game. Make sure if you push the ghost down, you hear it click, or the traps won't work. I'd love to know how this thing works on the inside, because several, but not all at the same time, traps spring each time, and the fun is not knowing which pieces will be casualties. The girls thought it was hilarious. We played it over and over. They loved the suspense of who would get attacked by a trap, and they thought it was hilarious that my piece always fell off the stairs, and one of them got flung out the back window/door! That was a surprise.We had a lot of fun playing it. They even used it to play Scooby-Doo as a playhouse with the pieces (all characters from the show). However, the more characters played, the more of a logjam on the game. Especially when multiple characters had issues with the same trap. Characters can't occupy more than one to a space. This is important for certain traps to work. The round base of the pawns fit exactly on the round circle/spaces to properly position the pieces for the traps.The game also has to be partially disassembled in order to fit back in the box. This is a little tedious. Hopefully the back cardboard wall pieces hold up from repeated disassembly/reassembly.Overall, cute concept, fun when it works properly. Make sure the ghost clicks to spring the traps! It's very noisy when the game works. Almost sounds like the grinding roar of some of the creepy characters of the game.",Kids_games

Or should I say ""attempting"" to install it. As most of the reviews state, this product is deeply flawed. This design is sold under more than one company name, so watch out. Literally nothing fits the way it should. Yes I do mean ""literally"". The picture only instructions are ambiguous or just plain wrong and there are no written instructions. Oh, and if you make it to the end, where the instructions show a picture of a hacksaw shortening the screws to allow the end caps to fit, it won't work. The screws need to be slightly shorter than the opening, not flush with it the way the will be when you are done. It would have been nice to know that before I spent 20 sweaty minutes sawing through metal.Trying to install this thing was an exercise in frustration. I spent 2 hours trying to make this work and have given up. The stress this thing caused me probably took a year off my life. I haven't been this mad in a long time.

I don't know how warm the structure will be in deep winter since it is only wood and not insulated, but it is in the corner of my deck tucked in against the house with a partial roof overhang. I have stuffed the plastic strips that it was shipped with underneath the house and on two sides. The house was packaged fairly well. There was a tiny crack on one of the slats on the roof, but it will not hurt the functionality, so I kept it as is. It was easy to put together with an electric screw driver and I was alone.

They are faulty and Revlon does not care about customer service, either.",Pet_care
2895,"I purchased this product a few of years ago. Initially it seemed to be a good product. It lasted for several months, and then the problems set in.1) The dispensing bowl is attached to the reservoir bowl by two plastic nuts that thread onto two threaded plastic shafts extending from the dispensing bowl. There is also a small plastic tube that extends from the dispensing bowl, and fits into a receptacle in the reservoir bowl body. The tube is sealed to the receptacle by two small recessed O-rings. These O-rings are junk. During assembly the O-rings will twist and bind against each other preventing a good seal. Which in turn, will result in an empty waterer and a flooded floor? - My fix, use a food grade silicone to seal the tube to the receptacle. Problem solved; no big deal.2) The filters that are used with this unit are also complete junk. They are a multi-layered filter, with each layer of filtration ""supposedly"" providing a beneficial purpose. However, this filter frequently becomes clogged. The first layer of filtration is a particulate screen; good in concept - bad in implementation. The useable surface area of this screen is less than an inch in diameter, so any debris (usually food particles and hair) that falls into the reservoir bowl will clog this filter fairly quickly. It usually takes about a week to clog it up. Once it becomes clogged, the water no longer flows. Well, so much for filtered water.3) An easy way to unclog the filter is to back-flush it. Weekly back-flushing will extend the filter life for about a month before it has to be replaced. The filters originally came four to a pack, then three to a pack, now only two to a pack, but the price has never decreased. Ok, blame it on inflation. (Greed?)4) The pump actually seems to be quite hardy. It has never had a problem. However, the water flows into the pump before it passes through the filter. This arrangement causes debris to get caught around the impeller of the pump (mainly hair), and the water flow slows down to a crawl. - My fix, remove the pump from the reservoir bowl, dissemble the pump, remove and clean the impeller, and reassemble. Well, so much for unattended watering.5) The original reservoir bottle was made from a fairly durable plastic, and it lasted about two years; then once again my floor began to flood repeatedly. This time the problem was problem much harder to diagnose. The reservoir bottle developed a small crack underneath the screw-on lifting handle. The cracked reservoir bottle could no longer sustain a vacuum, and would empty its contents as fast as the air can flow in through the crack. I tried to seal the crack using the food grade silicone, but unfortunately the silicone would begin to leak as well. So, I ordered a replacement reservoir bottle.6) The replacement reservoir bottle was made from a thin flexible plastic. I initially assumed the thin flexible plastic was an upgrade to make the bottle more resistant to cracking. Wrong. About 2 months after I replaced the bottle, my floor began to flood once again. This time the flooding was very infrequent, and I thought perhaps my pets were just being messy. I didn't even suspect the new bottle was cracked until my floor was once again flooded regularly. Once I discovered the crack under the screw-on lifting handle I called Ergosys, and requested a warranty replacement for the bottle. I was told even though the product was clearly defective and that it shouldn't have cracked, I would have to purchase a new bottle because, the 1 year warranty had expired yesterday. (Yes, that was the final straw and impetus for this review)7) There is a removable centering device for the bottle. It resides in the reservoir bowl, and helps guide and support the bottle into place during bottle installation. This centering device is another piece of junk. It cracks more frequently than the bottle. The cracks seem to have little effect on the performance of the waterer, but why is it cracking in the first place?Despite the good rating from other reviewers, I would caution against relying on this unit to provide prolonged unattended watering for your pets (a week if your lucky). Furthermore, I definitely would NOT recommend using this unit near a wooden floor or carpeting; it is simply too prone to flooding the floor.I do not own the large pet waterer, but it stands to reason the large and medium pet waterers may also be prone to these same problems.Buyer beware!",Pet_care

2899,"I bought 2 of these when we adopted 2 young Maine Coon cats, at the recommendation of their foster mom. She noted that both cats loved the ones she had in her house and they were sturdy enough for Maine Coons (big cats). She was right, 4 months later I don't know what we would have done without them. They are excellent scratching posts (save my furniture) and the kitties will spend hours on them watching birds through the window (kitty tv). The cats leap on them, sleep on them, hang from them and chase each other over, around, and under them, and after 4 months of very heavy use, they still look like new. And they haven't even come close to toppling over yet. I even liked the price, and with Amazon Prime, no shipping fees, and it arrives in 2 days. I know I sound like an advertisement, but I can't think of a bad thing to say about these cots. The cats love them and so do I.

2908,"In general, my cat is pretty indifferent when it comes to store-bought toys. She tends to prefer balls of tinfoil, paper bags, cardboard, etc. The first few days, she was not really into these. Then she saw the way they bounced and rolled on the linoleum kitchen floor and is now completely hooked. She goes totally nuts; smacking into cupboards and rolling all over the floor playing with these. The plastic is stiff enough that they roll well but pliable enough that she can pick it up in her mouth, chew it (she's never broken off a piece to eat), stick her paw through the middle; it's hilarious to watch. They are pretty hardy so even when you inevitably step on them in the dark, they bounce back into shape pretty well. My only complaint is that they only come 3 per pack. If I could buy bulk, I would because there is an entire pack under my refrigerator right now! Every time my kitty gets one stuck under something, she goes nuts trying to get it out, so if I can't get it easily I break out another.

I spent hours debating between this, leap frog, leapster, etc. After I decided on InteracTV DVD, I started reading the reviews on Amazon and I became very concerned about how hard it was going to be to program into the DVD player. I almost took it back without even trying it... glad I didn't! It took all of 3 mintues to program... worked with the very first code! I was so happy!!

Ah man we had so much fun after i did that, that we kept using the idea, and made the game so much more fun. The last couple of nights we played before i had to leave, just 1 hand took us about a couple of hours to finish, it was like playing a game of Monopoly that you didn't know when it was going to finish as it was back and forth all night. I played with a strategy in mind whch was to prevent anyone but myself from winnning when they were low on cards and i had like 20 cards in my hand and all of them were draw twos and draw four cards and i combined them all in one play and kept the Wild Draw four as my ""Uno"" card to automatically win the game.

We use the mini treat bones that are oraganically made so they are still good for him. I don't put his food in it, the bones are shaped enough that they don't fall out easily so it takes a little work. He will work on it all day! He gets bored very easily and this has been a wonderful diversion for him. I am getting ready to purchase our second one as the first is starting to wear out. He has discovered he can position the hole above his mouth and tilt his head back. Then he will squeeze a little and sometimes bones will fall in his mouth. This has resulted in it cracking a little.

I was looking for a replacement of my Doskocil litter scooper and this seemed to look the same on the website... what a disappointment when I got it!My old Doskocil is the only litter scooper on the market that I know of that actually filters scoopable litter effectively because it has a 3/16 inch ridge at the lowest point of the pan, right where the smallest solid pieces of the sifted litter collect. Ideally this ridge would be even twice as wide. The scooper I received does have a narrow solid part but on a slope, not the lowest part of the pan... so, it is of no use whatsoever to sift out the small solid parts (the most difficult to get out).

I bought them the Jolly ball with the handle when they were puppies, and although they still play with it, the handle is long-gone. When I got this one with the rope, they eventually chewed through the rope. I went to the local odd lots-type store and bought a pack of similar size rope and cut a new piece, knotted it into the ball and they were ready to roll. I got the rope for about $4 and there is probably enough to replace it 5 or 6 times.This ball is the first thing Augie goes for when he goes outside, & he tries to bring it into the house every day. It is great because they can grab it by the rope. The two dogs run through the yard holding the rope at the same time. When they run the ball flies around, which I think adds to the fun. Augie also grabs the ball by the rope & swings it up for me grab so I can throw it. He will fetch this ball until I make him stop (Due to dragging tongue). Another plus is, when they drop it for you to throw, the rope keeps it from rolling away. I would recommend this to anyone.",Pet_care

Harsh, yes, and I did get chapped skin. I wanted to emulate my Gram, and she would smooth Ponds cold cream on her face then gently wipe it off. Then she would put Ponds dry skin cream on her face, and she had lovely skin until she died at age 98. I guess I inherited really wonderful skin from her.Since then, I have gone on to other moisturizers during the day, but at night I still stick with Ponds dry skin cream, especially after a good face wash. I do not wear any makeup so I do not have much to wash off, it is just a ritual. But the Ponds rich dry skin cream sinks right into my skin, it has kept it soft and supple and truly wrinkle free for many years, and you just can't beat the price for the amount you get.So I will continue my regimen, it works for me.

When I first rec'd it, I also noticed that it was made in China, so I checked all the pet recall lists to ensure it was safe. There was no mention of this bone being part of the wheat glutin problem, so I gave it to him.

When I went to get him out of the crib this morning he was holding the toy and had to get it out too...he's been carrying it around and playing with the remote too. I really wish I would have had this when my boys were babies....very neat little lullaby toy. The remote works great and you can adjust the volume (which many toys don't allow).

2998,"I have medium to light brown hair naturally, but have been dyeing it at home for several years. I usually use a dark ash blonde shade, and my hair usually ends up a golden blonde with lots of red/orange tones. I decided to try L'Oreal Preference 8 1/2A Champagne Blonde and use the Ardell. It turned the dye a dark purple/black like the other reviews mentioned, and I only used 5 drops, which is much less than they say to use. I could tell a difference as soon as my hair dried- my hair was lighter than I've ever been able to take it, but instead of seeing more orange or red, I saw much less- I look closer to a blonde instead of a strawberry blonde. I have also mixed some into my conditioner and used it that way. Next time, I'll be adding the recommended amount to the hair dye.

3002,"First of all, Amazon has this product listed as ""Well Water Action"" but the product that I received is ""Hard Water Wellness."" At the time, the product photo did not match the description, but I bought it anyway, and now I see that Amazon has changed the photo to match the description, so you might actually receive a different product. Or perhaps the manufacturer has simply changed the name of the shampoo.Anyway, I have had limited success with this shampoo mostly because my particular well water does not work well with detergents. It is very high in manganese but low in iron, making it very difficult for any existing filtration system to remove the manganese because most filters depend on bonding the manganese to the iron in order to remove it. On top of that, our water is very soft (water hardness is not an indicator of all mineral content, but of calcium content only) so any type of water softening does not help me. My hair suffered greatly before we discovered what the problem was -- our water, instead of the shampoo/curling iron/hair dryer, which I kept thinking it was -- but once I began rinsing my hair with vinegar in the rinse water it improved greatly, and even more so when I began the ""no 'poo"" baking soda plus vinegar regimen. I bought this shampoo because it is not always convenient for me to use the baking soda, and sometimes I just want to wash my hair like a ""normal"" person. I can't really use it more than a few days in a row because it does build up on my hair, but at least the build up is not nearly as bad as it is with a regular SLS shampoo. I also wash my 5 year old daughter's hair with it because it is tedious to use baking soda and vinegar on her hair, and it doesn't seem to build up and break her hair off as bad as traditional shampoo either, but we don't wash her hair every day (while I do wash mine every day). Bottom line, if you have well water with a high mineral content, I think it is worth the six bucks to try this stuff and see how it will do with your hair and your water. Plus, it smells really great. Especially compared to vinegar.",Pet_care

The prices on Amazon are fabulous, but I'd still recommend smelling it somewhere if you can.

So far, no takers.

Maybe there's just something about the catnip they use in their products that is turning my cats into catnip snobs.Anyway, if you're going to buy this to try out, get as small a container as possible to make sure your cats actually like it.

However, I did get the pretty cool Wolverine figure with motorcycle and finally after staring me down several times while I was in the store the Fantastic Four's Thing finally made it home with me.As a depiction of the Thing from the origin of the team it is pretty spot on. His rocky (Cap 'n Crunchy?) exterior looks good and the paint really makes it look like hard rock, which is good since that's all he's got as his uniform consists of his blue underwear. He does have a semi-constipated grimace on his face but its not really that bad. He has good articulation, elbows, knees, wrists, fingers, neck, ankles and so on.Now, the Wolverine has a cool motorcycle so is Thing's transportation just as cool? Ah, heh heh, nope. It's a Fantastiscooter or basically a hovering moped and to be honest he just looks silly sitting on it as he's so big and the scooter looks so effeminate.

3056,"Back in unicron.com, we thought that Leobreaker is awesome. Well, he is! He's very mighty since he was still Overhaul with the awesome claws and yet bad arms. He is still cool. The lion mode was a nice touch. Even he combines with Optimus Prime. Looks great to me. And you can buy him too, because the clerk will notice. Even though he is $20.00, you can still buy him! And his tail is used for a battle axe. SWEEEEEET!!!!!!!!!!! And the best part is he can be turned into a weapon so OP will hold both weapons. Now that's the Ultimate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah!! Well, if you were a smart hombre, then you'd know Leobreaker is the coolest!!!!! Besides Overhaul and the new Brushguard. I bet his toy is beautiful. Good thing I rated 5 stars. Yep. 5 out of 5. And none of his parts fall when you leave home. And you can never leave home without it. Ah, just when Mudflap was an Autobot and then he is a Decepticon. But he cares about Prime and hates Megs. And Evac, he doesn't look doctorey like Red Alert, but he transforms into a rescue helicopter. Wait, where's Red Alert?! There's an upgrade of him in the ultra class which was Galaxy Force FirstGunner. There are other upgrades like Hot Shot and Scattorshot. And Leobreaker is the upgrade of Overhaul. The reason why he did this is because he wanted to be in the Jungle Planet, but doesn't have a beast mode. And that's why he became GF Ligerjack. What a potassium. He's still awesome, no doubt. I hope you highly recommend this toy. And besides, upgrades don't make the figure that special, by the way.",Kids_games

Also, it smells a bit like raw pizza dough to me which is a bit odd, but I've gotten used to it and it doesn't bother me so much any more.

I have 2 children, a boy almost 5, and a girl almost 7. He has been biting for a few months, she for probably a year. They both had absolutely NO nails left and also were biting the skin around the nail. I would tell them to stop when watching tv, etc, but could not stop them while they were at school, etc.3. It WORKS! They actually have nails! I put it on Wednesday afternoon for the first time. I reapplied inconsistently (it does wear off) - you could reapply twice a day or every couple days, depending on how much you need. By Monday afternoon, I could see decent nail growth on both children. My son did try to bite (more than my daughter) - and would then go get a drink to wash the taste out. It does taste very bad - not enough to make you sick, but enough to make you stop biting and help remember not to bite next time.

I see where they are now giving you 18 trays for about the same price we were paying for twelve, but at over $1.00 each they are still too much.We recently bought a Scoop Free and are more than happy with it. It works as advertised and even though the replacement cartridges are expensive, they last a long time and actually cost us less than we were paying for litter alone. We have now bought a second Scoop Free and find we only use three cartridges a month, and have never had to clean it except for waste that has gotten on the sides that needs to be wiped off, but we would have that problem no matter what type of box we used.If you are thinking about buying an automatic litter box I would suggest you buy the Scoop Free instead of this one.

There's A LOT of feedback and at times I can barely hear what she's saying (and she can't hear me much either.) We have to stand within 5-10 feet of each other to get as optimal a sound as we can. There's one button that is like a call button (makes a beeping sound) but it really only comes through when the receiver has their walkie talkie open (I thought it would be fun for it to ""call"" the other walkie talkie when it's closed to warn the receiver that they have a call coming in....Nope...so I don't get the point of the ""call"" button when it's only used when someone has their walkie talkie already open and in listening mode.) My daughter has been a HUGE Strawberry Shortcake fan for 2 years (just starting to come out of it) so she doesn't mind them.

A smart tap on the base after you roll it, and any clumps that are stuck drop right off. No wasted litter, no litter kicked out of the box, no scoops to mess with.

I've had two pregnancies back to back and I never used anything on my stomach so I got really bad stretch marks and this product is working great. One thing about the product is that you really have to be dedicated to put the time and effort so it can work the way it's suppose to work. I read in other reviews that this product is old and that's why it comes in a tanish color. Well, ladies don't believe everything you read because unless you do research like I did you will know that, that's a lie. Today I went to Macy's and saw this exact same product come in a 2oz tube and I opened the tester to see the color since people want to say it's old and guess what, the one at Macy's was tanish too. Ladies don't know that every cream comes in different colors because every cream is used for different purposes.

3142,"After trying a number of collars for my two medium sized dogs (one basenji mix and one cattledog mix), I was about to give up walking them when I found the gentle leader's collar. Walking two dogs that weigh almost 40 - 50 lbs each was quite the ordeal when they decided (as they often did) to go in different directions. I've notice a few negative reviews around the fit, etc. I watched the dvd prior to trying it and didn't seem to have any difficulting finding a good fit for my dogs. Each were trained separately on the collars and the difference between walking them now is like night and day. We now take them regularly to parks and have even gone on several vacations. Walking with the collars on is easy, and the dogs can easily open their mouths and drink, bark, or take treats. Again, I'm only speaking from my own experience, but the dogs are very eager to put on the collars anytime we go out now... and what used to be an ordeal is now a pleasure. Just my two cents.

3145,"My first impression open opening the package (and smelling the products, naturally), was ""This smells like allergies!""Granted, that's not anyone's fault but mine, since I bought this having a pretty vague idea of what lavender, in particular, smelled like. I'm also allergic to a disturbing amount of flora, so to be fair, anything that smells vaguely earthy and plant-ish gives me a similar reaction. Given the titular ""lavender mint,"" I was expecting something of a cross between various Bath & Body Works Lotions and my toothpaste. Not so. I think I have a decent idea of what smells minty, and this didn't smell minty at all to me, so I can only assume it smells like lavender, in which case I apparently am not a particular fan of lavender. (Again, not anyone's fault but mine.) The scent isn't unpleasant, it's just not something I'd pick out.As to the scent being cloying, I found that I could really only smell it as my hair dried (which admittedly takes a while as my hair is waist-length and I very rarely blow dry it). After my hair was dry, however, I had to specifically grab a hunk of hair and place it under my nose and inhale to be able to smell much of anything, which is not something I'm in the habit of doing, but I guess if you sniff your own hair frequently, it could get annoying if you're not a fan of the scent. As far as I'm aware, no one else could smell it on me, either, which is good, because I'm not of the school of ""well, I like this scent, so naturally everyone within a ten foot radius will want to smell me.""Regarding the supposed tingly feeling some reviewers did/didn't get - the only tingly feeling I felt while using this product was in my arms trying to work this puppy into a lather. My previous shampoo lathered at the slightest provocation, so at first I was pretty determined to make this do the same. It didn't work. If you find copious amounts of suds necessary for a pleasant showering experience, you're going to be sorely disappointed with this product. It lathers, certainly, but relatively minimally.Once I got over the disappointment of not being able to create a bubble mountain atop my head and rinsed, I found that this shampoo left my hair feeling quite clean. I wash my hair every day (yes, yes, I know - hairdressers everywhere just died a little inside). It's not something I'm willing to stop, however, which allows me to find pretty quickly just how moisturizing (or un-moisturizing) a particular product is. I wouldn't say that this product dried out my hair, but it didn't leave it looking like a Pantene commercial, either (I'm not endorsing Pantene here - there's a reason I don't use their hair care products, but the models in their hair commercials always have gorgeous, shiny hair).I'd highly advise anyone using the conditioner to leave it in for as many minutes as you can. Even though the bottle doesn't say to, let it sit in your hair for a bit. The few times where I was in a bit of a rush and basically applied conditioner and immediately rinsed it out left my hair feeling very dry. However, leaving it in for multiple minutes while I carried on with my shower left my hair feeling deliciously smooth and silky when I rinsed it out (some of this silkiness was lost as soon as I my hair started to dry, unfortunately.) On the whole, my hair seems slightly less frizzy than it was before I started using this product. The main difference I've noticed is that it definitely is softer - particularly at the ends.On the whole, I like this product, but once I finish the (rather large) bottles, I'll probably try something else. It works, and more or less seems to do what it claims, but certainly doesn't do anything beyond that.",Pet_care

I used it on the ""4"" tension setting, which is supposed to be for thick hair, but the instructions suggested starting with that setting, so I did. I honestly can't tell a lot of difference in tension on the different settings, plus it's VERY difficult to see the numbers (they're at the base of the knob). I only used the low setting, so I'm anxious to see how well it holds today. I will try the high heat setting next time. It held my hair well without pulling, and is very easy to use. It really is just like brushing your hair! I held the ends of my hair with my left hand as suggested.

Of course, if they are in a candle holder (something with sides, again, so they don't roll) they lose some of their visual appeal. As such, these make for better decoration if left unburnt.

3171,"I bought this elite model because I adopted 2 cats from the shelter and do not want to be a slave to the litter box. It seemed alright at first, the first week. But, I have to scoop every day and empty the bin every day. If I miss one day it will over flow. I don't know how anyone could only empty this once a week, not even for just one cat.I am writing this review to save you some sleep. It has a loud motor. The rake gives up when raking and keeps trying to clean the box but the clumping litter sometime makes it stop. It keeps trying... all night... until I get up at 2 am to scoop poo. Really!! I don't think any other litter box will wake you up to scoop poo! It doesn't matter how high you fill the line, it doesn't really clean all the box, you need to scoop every day.The rake sometimes pushes the poop backwards after in goes between the rake and then hides it. Somehow, there is always litter leaking onto the tiles under the box.This was a large investment, so I need to make it work for a while, so here are the tricks to live with this box until you can get a better one.1- use a plastic grocery bag (without any holes) to line the waste receptacle. This way you can switch out the bag every day instead of switching out the receptacle.2- keep a hand vac right next to the box so you can vacuum up all the loose litter that somehow gets everywhere every day. It makes easier clean up, but you need to vacuum around the box and under the receptacle every day when you change it or it gets everywhere.3- make sure you use clumping litter. If it is loose, it doesn't clean, if it is really hard the motor isn't strong enough to push it. So, you loose no matter what. I have found that fresh step keeps the odor under control better than other litters.4- use two sided tape on the lid of the bin on the outside, because the cats like to scratch it open to try to get to the poo in the bin to try to cover it and will break it open with their claws. IF you have 2 sided tape there for a week, they give up ripping it open.5- Also line the receptacle lid with a plastic bag. Sometimes the poo that gets raked into the bin gets stuck to the lid and it is gross and makes you replace the bin lid. I have refused to buy more bins since the cost for the box was crazy high.Good luck. For now, cleaning the litter box is the part time job I have after working all day and going to school at night. I am a complete litter slave until they come up with something that actually works.",Pet_care

3189,"Thought I would review this product, as we've been using the collar for about 2 weeks now. Lucky is a 7 yr old yellow lab (my girlfriends). We've just moved into a house together and noticed the dog was extremely thirsty, especially when we arrived home. Doctor gave her a clean bill of health, so on a hunch we decided to video the dog while we were gone and it turns out she was barking nonstop while we were away (8 hours when left that long). Having spent the last 5 years in a large house with a lot of space between the houses, my girlfriend couldn't completely discount the notion that Lucky has been doing this for years. Lucky would be barking when she would arrive home each day, but she attributed it to the automatic garage door opening (the preferred way to enter that house).Well, the new place is a large row home in the city. Even though the neighbors haven't contacted us via note or face to face, I'm sure we are not held in high regards at this point. I know they can hear her. We tried crating her, which she is very familiar with, but that would only grant us about 1 hour of quiet before the bombardment of anxiety filled yelps and barks would commence relentlessly till we arrived back home. We decided to go with the Premier GentleSpray Citronella Anti-Bark Dog Collar because it wasn't a shock collar, and it would work while we were away. When we are home, Lucky only barks to alert us of someone at the door, or loud unusual noises.It was easy to set up, load, fit and we were in business in under 5 minutes. We decided to go out for dinner and thought we'd give the dog about 2 1/2 - 3 hours of time to get acquainted with our the system. While the laptop video ran, we had a great dinner up the street and drinks with friends. We arrived home to see what happened while we were gone via the laptop video. After we left, Lucky paced nervously back and forth, hit the collar box on a wooden chair arm and got sprayed for no reason. Although it was funny, it's not teaching her anything. So after a few minutes of confusion, she started barking for us to return only to receive a blast in front of her face of citronella spray. She looked around trying to figure out who just sprayed her. She changed locations in the room and tried barking again. Blast #2. Walked to another corner of the room, bark, blast #3. upstairs, bark, blast #4. How about a howl instead, blast #5. She then retired to her crate to avoid this unpleasant phenomenon and was quiet till our return. All of this took place in the first 20 minutes of our leaving the house.That was about 2 weeks ago. We've stopped setting up the webcam video while we are gone. Not only has Lucky stopped anxiety barking, but she seems much, much calmer now. The last couple of videos showed her wandering the house, sniffing around, goofing with the cats, and napping either in her crate (door open) or on her dog bed.It worked perfectly as advertised. She only wears it while we are away and we all are much happier.",Pet_care

3200,"FURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool with 4-Inch EdgeThis product works great on our yellow lab. She sheds a lot, and this works just like it says. Really cuts down on the hair in the house! The only thing you have to watch out for, is use the product just like the instructions say - don't go over and over the same area, or you can irritate their skin. Also be careful on sensitive areas.",Hair_products
3201,"Nice design and very well-made. Glad to find anything made in the USA these days. However, I wouldn't recommend this for a Pug, which is the breed for which I purchased it. The strap that runs from the chest to the belly is too long for a Pug, but would be fine for a larger dog. I had to get the 14""-24"" size as Pugs are very broad-chested, but having the larger girth means having a longer chest strap. The rear loop that goes around the dog should be just an inch or so behind the front legs; on this one it's much further back. The causes the chest strap to ""bunch up"" when the dog sits, so having all that extra room means the dog gets his front feet through the neck loop quite often. I would definitely recommend this for a big dog, but not for a stout dog like a Pug.",Pet_care
3202,"I love the adult version of this game, and the kids I work with love this version!It teaches some vocabulary and reasoning, and can be a phenomenal ice breaker in a daycare or school-aged care setting. This is the most valuable board game/card game our afterschool program had. If you own one board game for your kids, have this be the one.(the only downside is that it needs three or more players.)",Kids_games
3203,This item is a nice size( not to big or small) and is pretty durable. My pets love it and anyone who buys it won't be dispointed.,Pet_care

3209,"I have hair down to my waiste, so quality shampoos are very important for me. I was having problems with a dry, itchy/flakey scalp, so I tried several products (including one medicated shampoo), but nothing really seemed to help. Finally, I found the Jason Tea Tree Oil shampoo, and it has worked wonderfully!I think it is best if you actually follow the instructions on the bottle - it directs the user to do a quick, non-lathery ""pre-wash"" to clean the scalp and then follow up with a rich, lathery wash to remove excess dirt that didn't get washed the first time. I have actually found this method to work pretty well.Really, I recommend any product from the Jason line of hair care. Not only does it leave your hair looking and feeling great, but it's also environmentally friendly!",Hair_products

3212,"I've owned cats for decades now and also do cat rescue and fostering (so I'm talking a lot of cats with a lot of preferences) - these are my favorite covered litter boxes by far! If you need a covered litter box then this is a great choice. I have 3 Large size boxes now (for my 2 permanent kitties).If put together properly and used properly then it works great at removing clumps while allowing the clean litter to remain in the box. It lessens the need to ""touch"" the dirty litter via scooping as all you need to do is remove and dump out the 'drawer'. I will say that it can take a little finesse to roll the box over, back to the neutral position, and then a little past neutral with a little shake to even the litter back out. But everyone who has ever seen/tried my Omega Paw litter boxes have become believers.Both of my current cats are also litter throwers so the shape and design of the box keeps the litter well contained (the boxes are nice and deep). If you are wondering whether to buy the regular size or the large size box, I recommend opting for the larger size as it gives your cat more room to move around. My two cats are large and lean, 12 and 14lbs - big guys - and they have plenty of room in the box.One caveat to any litter box - it still needs to be properly maintained. Meaning frequent scrub downs in addition to the clump removal. I find these Omega Paw boxes to be easy to take apart, wash, and put back together.",Pet_care

3214,"I like the show very much, but the game had complicated directions for something so simple...it was made ""cheap"" and only one deck of cards so you go through the cards pretty fast...it is not very exciting to play. To play you place cardbboard pieces on other cardboard places that are marked how much money you are up to when you get a answer...whoopee :( No board involved...speaking ""bored"" that is how we were, so we just pulled from the deck asked each other questions.. That was fun and educational to a level. Too easy for most educated people. Too pricey for what you get, needs more cards and something else, Jeff maybe?! I will watch the show...I would not purchase this product for the money.",Kids_games
3215,"I'd been avoiding this because I thought I was getting too old for these tween celebrities releasing fragrances. I don't mean to sound snobbish, but queuing up to buy something by Hilary Duff? No, thank you. I just couldn't resist it in the end though. I'm very pleased to say I was wrong to pre-judge.At first spay there is a pleasantly sweet fruit/floral top note of mangosteen fruit, mangosteen blossom & vanilla. Don't be put of by this, admittedly these top notes doesn't help peoples first opinions that WITH LOVE is a `younger' scent.It's the middle notes of exotic spices, chai latte, balsam, incense and wonderfully `creamy' amber milk that make WITH LOVE stand out from the crowd. I'm not sure how to describe the effect other then `warm'. The spices & incense aren't too heavy, but lend a wonderful scene of sophistication. Not something I expected!!The base of cocobolo wood and amber musk blends nicely with the middle notes, so the transition is very subtle.What can I say? I was really surprised by the depth of WITH LOVE, and think it should be marketed for people out of their teens. It's perfect for any time of the year, and for everyday wear, and evening or special occasions.",Perfumes
3216,"I've been using this product for one week now. It has been working good on my underarms, but hasn't been working as well on my bikini area.

3219,"I think this fountain is certainly a nice way for my two dogs and cat to have fresh water available to them all day every day, with little maintenence from me. I will say, the only negatives I see are the look of it...it definitely looks cheap and really doesn't ""fit in"" with your typical home decor...also, if you have skiddish animals like my one dog, you have to be very patient...she wouldn't go near it the first 3 weeks! When all is said and done...great fountain for a lower price than buying it in the store...and as always, Amazon doesn't dissapoint!",Pet_care
3220,"First of all, in my opinion, the games for this system are great and my preschooler loves them. BUT I would not recommend this system for the following reasons:- The mouse is very awkward and doesn't work well in a child's hand. My son gets frustrated with it, which is a problem since most of the games require the mouse, not the keyboard.- I was highly disappointed to find that a power supply was not included with the system. You have to buy it separately, which was not disclosed on the box. It takes 4 C batteries, and it goes through them very quickly. For the price, a power supply should have been included.- I have a difficult time finding games for it. Target doesn't carry them at all. Walmart only has a few. And they're not cheap.Overall, I don't think this system is worth the cost. I wish I had done my research and purchased something different.",Kids_games

3223,"I have been using Adams Plus Flea & Tick mist for several years and I could nto be happier with the product. It is VERY effective and does what it says it does.I can't go any further without stating that the single star reviews shown here are unfair as the majority of them did not use the product correctly. If used correctly as stated on the label you will no better product on the market for flea & tick control.I use Frontline on my pets and I use Adams for the interior of my home in the springtime and in the fall when fleas seem to be more active. I spray along the base boards, corners, under the furniture, under tables, etc. and then where my pets sleep either in their beds or favorite spots. A couple of times I forgot to spray and I would notice a flea on one of my cats and the Adams came out and I sprayed and there was never a problem with fleas. Please remember that I DO NOT spray my pets with the Adams as they use Frontline and I just use it for the interior of my home.Also too, when I spray, there is an odor but it soon dissapates and does not linger. This is a great product but use it accorinding to the directions. As I stated above I have used it for years and it is very effective.",Pet_care
