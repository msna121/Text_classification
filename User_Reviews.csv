"I absolutly love this modle. It is soooooooo cool. I am a big Smarty Jones fan so this was a must have. It is not really made for playing with, more like on a display shelf. I half a special section for him."
"I love this parfum spray. I was very pleased at the price as well. This size bottle will last a very long time. This is an older cologne and it is difficult finding it in the store, if not impossible. Yet I found it with no problem on amazon.com. They are so reliable. I will definitely order again and again.Deborah of Tennessee"
"We love this collar! It's sturdy, convenient, and beautiful! We've gotten many compliments on it!"
"The game that made me the most competitive fool in the world.You can't start studying? Play a game of mastermind! If you win (like I always do), the empowering feeling will unblock the mental barriers and you'll be off. Smart kids grew up on this game. Ha."
Got this for my boyfriend after smelling it in Men's Fitness. Love the cologne on him and he loves it too! Not too overbearing but definitely smells great! I would definitely recommend this product.
It's not messy and seems to kill the fleas. I use it on furniture and on the carpet and it works well. The inverted feature is the best.
We bought our daughter the Leapster system for Christmas and purchased the charger to go with it to save money on batteries. It takes a few hours to charge it for 10 hours of play according to the directions...personally I think it lasts much longer than that. The only problem is you kind of have to wiggle the leapster on the charger to get the green light to come on. My 5 year old has figured out how to do this so it's not difficult. Other than that I think it's a great accessory.
"Not what we were looking for. We wanted a party game for older 20's and thirty somethings. I would say this game would be good for Jr. High. The ""hosts"" inside the box are super annoying and cheesy. The cards were really pretty easy compared to some of the other games we played. My sister got this game as a gift, we tried it once and she decided to return it. Like I said, I can see jr. high kids maybe getting into this, but otherwise, it was pretty lame."
"I have used many of the different shampoos for dandruff.NONE of the Head & Shoulder shampoos or Selsun Blues work. Tea Tree oil sort of helped. Sebulex sort of worked. And regular strength coal tar shampoos (.5%) sort of work.Prescription shampoos never worked for me.This stuff works. Really well. I have gone back to using other stuff and after a few days, the flakes are back.And if you follow it up with a H&S; conditioner, your hair won't stink like that weird smelling shampoo.It does smell weird, but with the conditioner, no problem.And I never flake anymore. Ever."
"This is a really great scent, but it could of been better. I think it misses that extra zing you get when you test it on animals. I mean seriously, animals want to smell nice too."
Gave as a gift and owner said her dog loves this....takes it everywhere and it is very sturdy!
"My only take about this cologne is that it is too strong.. I don't know how one of the reviewers before me reached the conclusion that it can be hardly detected. I would recommend spraying it only once and I guarantee you would still smell it at the end of the day. Being strong as it is, I think it is more suitable for winter unless you live in an air-conditioned environment. I own this cologne in addition to Hugo Boss, Aqua de Gio by Armani, Addias Adrenaline. This, in addition to the Hugo boss and the aqua de Gio are equally my favorites."
"Although this food does have good quality ingredients, my German Shepherd never really had any solid stools while on it. While switching him to this food, he had diarrhea even though I switched him over VERY slowly. I still stayed with the food thinking that the diarrhea had to do with switching the main meat component from lamb to chicken. After three months on it though, his stools are still mostly runny. I have since change to the Taste of the Wild which he actually love to eat (it smells pretty good too) and his stools are improving. This does not mean that Blue Buffalo is not a good choice for your dog. Rather I would try it out and see how your dog does on it. If you find that their stools are not improving then switch."
This works just as described. I had no trouble putting it together and my cats are already using it more than their old boxes. It's so easy. Honestly can't imagine why we ever did it any other way.
Not a believer at first but it surprised me I'm buying again that's all you need to know if you want to get rid of your dandruff. Get this!!
"I bought this curling iron simply because I wanted try a cermaic iron and because it's made from helen of Troy, which is a manafacturer of many professional styling tools. My normal curling iron is the Conair Instant Heat series. I gave this iron 3 star because I find that it doesn't heat up or get as hot as the Conair instant heat --and as far as less frizz and flyaway...well, it's about the same as the Conair Instant Heat (which is chrome barrel). I returned it and bought the Conair Ceramic curling iron, and yup the Conair one is certainly hotter (95W Conair vs 80W Revlon) which means it takes less time for me to get a curl :D"
"These clippers are very quiet. They did not stress out my dog. They did not pinch, pull or bind up. I am very glad I purchased them. The price is good for what you get. They are worth it."
"Seems to be working well, keeps my puppy safe--He wants to be up where he can see out and he is. He tried to get out the first few times but it does snap onto his harness so he couldn't get completely out of it. I just wish it would support more than 30 lbs. He's a lab and will outgrow quickly."
"Our puppy can become very excited on walks when meeting other dogs or people. It has kept her from pulling while training her to walk properly and if she does get excited, it restrains her without choking her and straining her neck. It's very easy to adjust and put on her and has held up well for us."
I purchased this container after I bought the larger one [80 pounds] for his food. This was bought to house all of his treats and keep them safe from any and all animal teeth. I stack it on top of his larger container instead of having the bags on the top shelf on my rack in the kitchen. I had a mouse who feasted on the treats daily. Now it's dead from starvation. The lid is perfect and so is the size. I recommend this to all animal lovers and pet owners the world over. Worth every penny. Thanks Amazon.Com!
"Our baby, Ruby, loves this toy. She loves to do a ""drive by"" which is running by and swatting at it . . . so cute!"
"Since I'm a woman, it seems like any time anyone doesn't know what to get me, they resort to body sprays and lotions because all women are supposed to like those, I think. As a result of that, I have years' worth of body sprays sitting around and going bad because I just don't like them. But this one is different.This smells more like the stem and leaves of the tomato plant, so it's an earthy yet refreshing scent. I always get questions and compliments about this spray. I love that it's not flowery or fruity. It's probably not something a super girly-girl would like, but for someone who doesn't like the usual scents, this is perfect."
"I have been using Stuff-a-Ball toys for years. They're durable, and can entertain dogs for hours if properly stuffed. We have a variety of small and/or breakable dog treats that can be crammed inside. The more it's stuffed, the longer it will last as your dog chews on the pliable rubber--it's good for their gums, too! Read the packaging to make sure you order the right size for your dog."
it's one of the best games my friends and me ever tried - after getting used how the rules work it was a lot of fun.please beware of the potentially confusing rulebook and directly refer to the manufacturers website...additionally consider that for players who are totally new to this kind of board-games you have to calculate at least 2-3 hours to get through the rules
"I love Biosilk. This product is great for any hair type. Just a tiny dab (about the size of a green pea) on damp hair keeps my hair soft and silky under the most adverse conditions- blow drying, swimming pools, you name it. This is also great rubbed into your skin. Leaves you soft and silky all over. I also appreciate the way it tames dry flyaway hair. Try it, you will love it, too!"
I think this could be a great bag if you are not traveling far or have a very relaxed pet. Our 11 pound dog managed to chew threw the mesh siding about 20 minutes into our 5 hour flight. I think if the mesh was more durable it would be a great bag. I just feel I cannot give it better then a 1 star rating because we paid alot of money for this carrier to last 20 minutes. We had to purchase a different carrier to fly home with.
"This is my pets second crate given that she broke her first one by trying to put a door mat into the crate when she was home alone. I love the option of the two doors, our first crate only had one and was not convient (I had failed to think about the door location during my first purchase). Bella fits perfectly in the crate and sleeps very comforably, not cramped at all. Bella has the 30Lx21Wx24H which is perfect for her, she is a medium sized dog (Lab and Beagle mix)."
One of my dogs is very picky. She liked this. I was shocked. I was able to find it at Winco for 10.68-2.00 coupon on bag.
"A friend brought Whoonu to my house one night, and we wound up playing many rounds in rapid succession. It was such a riot that I had to buy the game to play with my family--people get really emotional about their choices! I would seriously love to ask anyone I ever could to play Whoonu, because it's a game absolutely anyone can play, and it's the best way I can think of to learn about someone while letting them know things about yourself too.Whoonu is an awesome ""get-to-know-you"" game--I don't know what's better, using it to become better acquainted with people you barely know personally or using it to learn more about people you think you already know like a book. The beauty of it is, it works for any group of people! Whether you're extremely close yet or not, the game is super fun and invites silliness. I only wish there could be infinitely many cards! I've never seen a game like Whoonu before. It's all about getting to know each other's favorite things--and you'll probably be shocked at how the things get ranked sometimes!I also love a somewhat similar game, Imaginiff, which I say is similar because it also focuses on the particular players, and/or people they know. It asks you to basically make a judgment on the other person's personality or likes by selecting what they would be ""if they were a ____"" on each card. Only, in that one, the person in question has less power--their own choices for themselves matter less than the choice that was picked by the majority of other players. It's the opposite in Whoonu, and I like that you get to determine the winners by sharing your actual favorite things. Still, if you enjoy Whoonu and this type of game, I'd offer Imaginiff as an additional recommendation. I would say that Whoonu is better if you've got a lot of younger people in your crowd and for those with limited attention spans, however, as it's been my experience that just about anyone will grasp the Whoonu concept very quickly and eagerly play several rounds in a row, because they go fast. Imaginiff tends to go on much, much longer, an entire game probably equaling many rounds of Whoonu, and while this doesn't bother me, I have on occasion had a harder time keeping everyone put 'til the end.The fun never ends with Whoonu--my groups love to mix it up and play one round choosing the ""Whoozit""'s favorites, and the next round, picking their least favorites! In that case, you select what you believe the person hates, and the thing they like LEAST gets the most points. Often, you'll have an awful hand for the person you're doing at the moment, because you think they hate (or if you're playing backwards, love) everything you've got. Or maybe you expect them not to care about any of your choices one way or another, or--well, anything can happen. And believe it or not, times like those make it even MORE fun! Playing Whoonu can really tell you a lot about somebody, and always makes a wildly hilarious game for parties or small get-togethers or whatever, so long as you have 3-6 players at a time. With very little set-up, it's incredibly simple and therein lies its genius. Every player gets to be Whoozit, so every player guesses for every other player before the game ends. Plus, the numbered tokens are cool, resembling wavy vegetable chips. Again, I would gladly play this game with just about anyone, and I'm glad I found out about it--I strongly recommend it to anyone, too!"
"I am pretty happy with this purchase. It has worked exactly as expected. I have been using this to store my dog food for a couple of months now. I like that the wheels let me roll it around easily and the airtight seal keeps the dog food smell contained. I do wish it was a little taller though, as the big 35-40 pound bags of dog food are a bit difficult to squish down in this when they are new. They will fit, but it is difficult to fully close the container with a brand new bag and I sometimes wonder if I am going to put too much stress on the lid or the seal by forcing it down in order to latch it, although it has not appeared to do any damage yet. Even with this minor issue, I am actually planning to buy a second one now, since my two dogs now eat different foods for health reasons. I have not had any issues with this item so far and although I don't absolutely love it, it does what it says and gets the job done. I do think the price is a little high, but still lower than what I remember other similar products being when I bought this several months ago."
"This is not a terribly expensive product and for the price, it works ok. It easily fit my Jeep Cherokee--no need for the extensions which was nice. However, it required modifications for it to stay in place. The screws which are supposed to hold the cross pieces in place do not tighten enough and my dog was able to push between the cross pieces and slide them apart! My husband used clamps to secure the cross pieces and they now work fine. The device could use some spring tension to tighten it between floor and ceiling as well because it can get knocked out of place (without even loosening). All that being said, if you are handy with a few tools, this barrier works well and is rather streamlined and unobtrusive."
"There really isn't a negative thing I can say about this product. I love the ceramic iron, and once you've used ceramic, you really can't go back to regular metal. And having a straightener and a huge roller all in one is a great idea! Also, my hair is naturally wavy, so this iron tames it and give it a little body where I want it, and not where I don't!I actually ordered this as a replacement to my old one, which I had for at least 5 years. But my toddler threw it on the ground and broke it, so for the time I had to wait for it to be shipped to me, it was like losing an arm!"
"I have a black lab and mini eskimo spitz and they both love dingo munchy stix! These are great for a quick treat or snack, but if your dog needs more of a ""chewing workout"" try the mini bones or rawhides instead. These munchy stix come in 2 flavors"
"Bella, a fun-loving black lab pup that loves to bark at anyone who doesn't pay attention to her, only needed to get sprayed twice before stopping the barking. She still barks, but now it's only when she should be barking. And since it's not harmful, I was happy to try it. I would recommend this product!"
This is the correct replacement flap for the petsafe large dog door. Worked fine and the door is like new.
"This game is terrific and can be enjoyed by kids and adults too. It helps familiarize players with African geography, and is a lot of fun. The game does not require any prior knowledge about Africa. Check the cards when you open the game. The first one we purchased (at a store - not via Amazon) had some sort of manufacturing default and we had too many plane cards and almost no truck cards. Since then we've purchased this game for ourselves and as a gift with no problems. We've also played the 10 Days in Europe and 10 Days in USA versions which are good fun too."
"I was nervous when buying this because I wasnt sure if this was the whole set or just replacements- I was pleased when it arrived and was the whole set.My dog has a great time with this toy. The little squirrels inside the trunk are squeaky toys, which she LOVES. The box came with instructions on how to modivate and teach your pet to use it. We put a small treat in the bottom and she had a great time digging it out. The whole process for removing the squirrels takes her less than a minute now, so if there is not a human near by to restock the trunk, she moves on to something else. This is not something I would leave her with and expect it to keep her occupied for the day.I would say that if your pet enjoys this general type of play (stuffed things, digging, hide and seek) this is an EXCELLENT toy and alot of fun."
"We had tried the Shed-Ender which was terrible, an awful waste-of-money. A guy up the street had recommended the FURminator, and I found it cheap here on Amazon, but it certainlt would be worth twice the price!!! Works bloody well on my long-haired terrier mix. My short haired pit doesn't like it too much (he's a bit precious), but it takes off his undercoat like no brush ever seen! A true find!!!!"
"Just a Great Toy. Our Son loves making music and dancing along, and there is enough variety of sounds and songs that it doesn't drive you crazy as a parent. Seams real sturdy and durable. A great learning toy, like most leapfrog stuff we've come across so far."
"Ah, chutes and ladders. A classic.It takes just minutes to learn but a lifetime to master the strategy.And you never know from game to game exactly how the child you play with will attempt to cheat this time, so it is always exciting. By the way, remind me to tell you about my ingrown toenail. Actually, on second thought, I prefer that nobody know about it, it's a little embarrassing. So, never mind.[...]. You know, for being a game I played as a kid that kids still play. But other reviewers have pointed out that young kids constantly get turned around going up the ladders and down the chutes. That's true, I'll dock a star for that, it does make it a hard game to play with any kid young enough to be interested in playing it. They could put little arrows across the bottoms of the rows to help people along, or a little trail of footprints or something cute like that. Still, kids do gravitate towards this game, they seem to like the little subplots around each chute and ladder, little stories of rewards and consequences."
"My daughter loves playing this game with her dad, and is not bored with it after 6 months of play. Great value."
"This is, by far, my kittens favorite ball!! He never stops batting it around! It does make a lot of noise on a tile or linoleum floor, so we take it away at bedtime!!"
We love playing Michigan rummy on an old set that is kept at the beach house - been there for 30 years - but it was hard to find another new version of the game. Tripoley is a good substitute. Fun and easy to play for the whole family!
this is the cooliest thing ever! and it doesnt mader how old u r because i saw people who have it and the like 20! not kidding! and i saw on the computer that even jamie leen spears( brittney spearses sister!)and a lot of other stars have them! so if famouse people have them then its cool!so if u never got any of them before then get he 1st one first then get the 2ndV then get the 3rdV so u can get used to them! well have fun with them! i know u will!(...)
"I played this game as a kid, and agree with the other reviewer in that the spinner comes off all the time (my eight year old daughter had a hard time getting it to spin properly), and the thing is flimsy. The ""people"" fell out of the cars almost every move... Does Milton Bradley have a deluxe version out there we can get instead? I would gladly pay an extra chunk of my hard earned money to get a real board and not have to reassemble it each time.Good luck"
"Our grand daughter Sara is into stuffed animals, the bigger the better, so when she saw this it brought a big smile to her face and at night when it sleeps with her, he keeps the monster out."
"My 31 month old son likes to play Chutes & Ladders, but still needs some help counting the right number of squares to move forward. But when I gave him this game yesterday, he wanted to play it all day long, and first thing this morning when woke up, he said he wanted to play the ""cherry game"" again! Picking the bright red cherries is fun for him and makes counting very tangible and easy to do for a little guy his age. Two thumbs up!"
"I love this box! It is so easy to use, it makes life much easier. I have two cats, and using a scoop to clean their box was horrible. I had to scoop almost every day. The Omega box is so much easier, and I actually don't mind doing it."
"We've had this for over a year now, and it's still working just as amazing as the first day!"
"I have two cats and foster at least one more at any given time. It can get quite busy in the litter boxes after their breakfast and dinner, so I've been looking for a second, bigger litterbox than the smallest of the two I currently have. I decided to try the Booda Dome, and if they hated it, well, fifteen bucks was worth a try. To my surprise, all three of the cats immediately took to it. They were climbing in and out of it before I had it assembled or put the litter in. As soon as I put it together and poured the litter in they immediately started scratching and using it. In fact when I went to clean out the two litter boxes today, I scooped ten times more clumps out of the Booda Dome than my regular open litter box.Pros:-Cats took to it immediately-Comes with a liner and filter, and the replacements are cheap-Filter helps with odor a LOT (as does the wheat litter I use)-Small round size lets it fit almost anywhere-The cats seem to enjoy the extra privacyCons:-My large cat (a long slender 12.5 pound tabby) has to stick his head out when he does his business (its rather adorable to see his little face, though, especially when he has his ""concentrating"" face on), so it is a wee bit small. My other two cats, the 7lb and 8lb kittens do absolutely fine with it and seem to prefer it over the other litter box."
Product works very well for me. I have fine hair and it holds and gives volume without damage and stickiness. Love it.
"I was skeptical when a friend raved about this treat for our cats, but she was absolutely right!! They love all the flavors--we mostly use chicken, salmon & cod. Great enticement to crumble over their canned food when they think you're giving them inferior food not worthy of their little palates (even when you're feeding the good stuff!). If I could rate this stuff 10 Stars on behalf of my Abyssinians, I would do so!!! They think this stuff is manna from the heavens."
"This is the first collar we bought after extensive research. We are thorougly pleased. We watched the video that came with it, and our dog responded so well with the training as presented on the video. We also use it for too much barking, although the video recommends a different product for continual barking. It was so important that our dog be well-trained (she is a fierce-looking black german shepherd) because we wanted others to be comfortable approaching her. (She is really a big baby and wouldn't hurt anything.) She has ceased jumping up on people, running after dogs, barking at anything going by, pulling us on walks, etc. You do have to invest the time to train as the video suggests. Our dog responded quickly. Definately worth the money."
This is our favorite game to play together as a family. My daughter is 7 and my son is 5. We take it everywhere we go. It was a big hit on our beach vacation. It is a perfect birthday gift along with something else small.I would buy two packs though as the cards run out fast with 4 playing.Enjoy.We also play the game Spot It for more laughs - simpler but another one that we can all play together.
"My puppy (Rhodesian Ridgeback) was able to pull all the squirrels out within a few minutes. Furthermore, within 5 hours of playing, she had the stuffing torn out of 2 of the 3 squirrels."
We bought this toy in October O8 for my grandson for Christmas. I took it out to put batteries in it and it blue screened. It did not work at all. So I went through the trouble shooting and then called Vtech on December 9 08. They said they would send a call tag to pick up the game and when they get it back they will ship me a new one. Well today is the 16th and still no call tag. I called again today because there is no way a new one will be here by Christmas if I have to wait for them to get me a tag and wait for it to get to them before they ship UPS ground for Christmas. It's their policy they keep saying. Then I asked to talk with the supervisor and was told the Sup would call me at 5:30 central time today. No such call happened. I am fed up with this company and will no longer buy their products.
"This product is okay. I feel like my hair needs to be damp, not totally wet, to spray on and then continually scrunch and play with so it doesn't weigh down my hair."
"This toy has a very poorly designed rip cord. If you don't pull it fast enough, the doll just spins. If it is pulled too hard it won't do too much there either. It worked great for a few pulls as the doll went at least 10-15 feet into the air.After those few pulls however, the rip cord started to not work very well as it became more and more difficult to pull and even had difficulty retracting back into the base.We have a 5 and an 8 year old, and they both had a difficult time pulling the rip cord to begin with, but once the rip cord got hung up even I had difficulty getting it to operate as well. Sometimes the cord could only be pulled back a few inches and sometimes hardly at all.Overall, this toy had potential, but the poorly designed rip cord is a big disappointment."
"This teddy bear is adorable and has been the center of attention for both of my dogs. We bought it for our puppy since she is teething, but both dogs play tug of war with this stuffed toy and so far, it has not shredded one bit. We have a pomeranian puppy (about 6 pounds) and a pekingnese beagle (about 20 pounds). The older dog is an aggressive chewer and he did not break this yet (which was very surprising!). I even washed this in the machine and it still is in perfect shape. Next time, I will get this in a darker color because it looks dingy already and its brand new. I definitely recommend this for puppies and dogs alike."
"I've used this product a lot over the years, but every time I've use it for a while, I move back to gel. Basically, the forming creme does a good job of keeping your hair controlled, but there downside is that your forehead will become ultra-greasy as the work day plods on. By close of business, your whole face feels quite a bit oilier than it would without this product.I recommend the creme, but also recommend that on those days when you do use it, that you wash your hair and face at the end of the day; otherwise, your complexion will start to suffer and your scalp might become irritated.I recently switched over to TIGI Bed Head After-Party Smoothing Cream for Silky, Shiny, Healthy Looking Hair! 3.4 oz, which doesn't feel greasy at all and makes your hair feel softer. I'll probably stick with that, despite the higher cost."
"This is such a great game, especially for 20 and 30 year olds. A great way to start off the evening if you don't know some of the people - everyone gets a little silly! Don't forget to buy batteries!"
We have tried several heated buckets to water our animals in winter. This is the best one yet.API 9 Quart Heated Bucket 9HB
"This is a great representation of Admiral Ozzel, the Imperial officer who learnt that coming out of hyperspace too early isn't a good career move. Moreover, in my opinion, it's also perhaps the best representation of any Imperial officer ever put out by Hasbro. Rather than simply a smooth olive-green uniform, Ozzel's uniform actually has a texture that feels like cloth. He has a decent amount of articulation for a 2004 figure. My only complaint is that he can't ever fully straighten his arm, especially his left arm, which is positioned at an acute angle. It's not a significant problem, but would have been nice to have gotten a greater range of motion."
"CUTE COLOR, NICE SUEDE. KITTY ATE THRU THE CLIP AND IT WAS OFF WITHIN 3 DAYS. CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE!!"
"As someone having to wear a patch for months and months I was looking for something big enough that my eye woudn't rub on it but not so huge as most of the patches out there. I would say that this patch is good in the sense that you can control the tension on your head, and it does fit under glasses."
My order was received and delivered as ordered and expected. No problems! I'm satisfied.
"I received this cat condo quickly. After reading the reviews I knew that using four screws would make putting it together much easier. Putting it together was a breeze, as the screws tightened, the top attached neatly to the bottom. My cat loves her new home."
"OK normally I follow age guidelines very strictly, but my 7mo is intent on walking and hasn't been giving me, daddy, or the every patient kitty a break with using us as walkers. Almost as soon as I had this out of the box, she is standing with it. Before I even got the toe stickers on she is taking her first heditant steps behind it. Yes sometimes its a little fast for her and she goes boom on her bottom, but always with a giggle and a pull back up on her inteli-block than a few more steps with her hippo.Originally I got this since I had a coupon and was just going to put it in the closet until she was ready, but she LOVES it. HOwever I am keeping it on thick carpet to keep it as slow as possible. She is no where near ready to take this thing for a spin on the tile."
"My mom has been using ""Beautiful"" for years and loves it.I love being able to get her her favorite perfume as a gift and her not knowing about it."
"This game is go for little kids because it helps with numbers. I play this game when I can, and my family likes it."
"I was very excited for this item to arrive after hearing how much my son enjoyed it at daycare. Unfortunately, we don't use it very often as the sock does not fit over his hand very well. Seems too small. It would be great if they stretched more."
"I've tried a million foods on my dogs, including Castor & Pollux's other foods. This has been by far the best. They gobble it up, but more importantly, it seems to be really good for them. As another reviewer mentioned, their stool is perfect, small and easy to pick up. For one of my dogs it's the only thing that doesn't give her diarrhea (sorry, but these are the gross details you need to know about a dog food :-)). Recently I ran out of Organix so I gave them a corn-based food for a while and they started getting bad breath almost immediately. As soon as I switched back, it was gone. They're even calmer than they were on other foods, which I think may not have fully satisfied them.Note that while this food has a lot of organic ingredients, which is great, the chicken meal is not organic and probably takes up the most weight (the organic chicken is likely mostly water). I appreciate that Organix now specifies that ""only"" 70% of its ingredients are organic. This is much better than you'll get from most brands while still being affordable, and it's just a fantastic food. I won't feed my dogs anything else."
"What a cool toy. It is almost like having a amusement Park in your own room! The track I have found to be very relible,But the supports a kind of wobly when the three cars scream over them. This toy only took me six hours with a few breaks. When you are done you fell like you have created a masterpiece. This is just one step closer of having a Roller Coaster in your room. Indeed The Screaming Serpeant Roller Coaster Is one cool toy!"
"Herve Leger is one of my signature scents. It's not too floral, more of a citrus/spicy perfume, and it's just heavenly. It's also unusual enough that it gets noticed a lot- I get stopped and asked about my perfume when I wear this.It's nice and light, but I think it works great for evening as well as in the daytime. I tend to wear this mainly in the summer, it works really well for hot weather- distinctive and delicious, but not overpowering."
"This was nice but not what I was looking for, I was looking for one that would hold 6 decks on one side and the discards on the other."
"I bought these as a replacement. I bought the machine about a year ago and loved it. I had no idea they were no longer available in stores. I do hope Dove will rethink manufacturing them. The little puffs clean and clarify the skin. They have plenty of soap, could probably use them twice."
"I bought this straightener for an overseas trip (to a country where electricity is unreliable). In theory, it is a great concept"
"Great for storing things besides sports cards. Much better than vinyl pages, which can can leech color from the item being stored."
"Hi,I am on the 3rd one of these CD-players in 4 month. My son loves it, it's the first thing he turnes on in the morning and the last toy he turns off at night. That's the only reason why I keep trying. The first of these CD-players played 3 or 4 CD's once each, then it was no longer able to read them. I went back to the store and exchanged it a week after my son got it for his 2nd birthday. The next CD-player started the same problem 2 month after the exchange, first I thought it's the occational scratch on one or two CDs but by the 4th month it didn't read any CD's anymore. The seller told me that they will not exchange the item another time. I think that 4 month for a $69.99 item is a bit stiff. The CD-player comes with no manufacturer's warranty. Otherwise great item, looks great, my son learned to sing tons of songs and talkes about ""lissening to Mozart and Vivaldi"". The CD-player has has an anti shock system but that was never needed in our household. My toddler learned to operate the player in minutes. The other downside is that there is no locking mechanism for the CD compartment, so we had to teach the kid not to touch the CDs. I really hope that this 3rd CD-player holds up longer, it breaks my son's heart not to be able to turn on his music."
"This toy is totally wicked! This playset comes with a Dalmation puppy, a hamster, and a fish. This playset includes"
This mat is very helpful. Our two cats are very messy eaters. It holds the bowl in place so it doesn't slide around. Now if it would only clean itself.
This is a fun family game. I like how all pieces fit into the canister box.
"I bought this exersaucer for my 6 month old daughter who has down syndrome. The quality is good and the variety of toys attached are really nice. Kyley was uncertain at first, but after a few weeks started enjoying it more. Now at seven months she likes it a lot and it has helped strengthen her legs. I think this a product that will continue to be enjoyed by her as she gets older. Kyley is not small for her age and a few of the objects are hard for her to reach at this time. Overall a well made product."
I have a fat maltese. With all that silvery white hair this pink collar make the nicest contrast .It is also strong and does not unclasp easily like some others I have purchased before.A real good purchase.
"Wish I could give this ZERO stars!Avoid at all costs. It didn't make my dog sick, but IT DOESN'T WORK. Use a flea comb every day, that works better than this garbage. Save your money and get Frontline or Advantage."
"I started playing this as a game at a math class, once I got the hang of it I loved it.To make the story shorter BuyBuyBuy!!!!"
This is the best thing that I have ever used for my Golden. She has arthritus so bad that she cannot walk without this supplement. I give it 5 stars. It takes 30 days to start working!!! It is WONDERFUL for senior dogs. She is 12 years old and plays like a puppy!
A friend introduced me to the Wonder Cloth. It is great. I use Blinc mascara and this makes it a breeze to remove at the end of the day.
"I bought this product because i had severe acne. i had tried multiple products before but none made a difference.after taking this product, i noticed a difference. not only physcally but mentally. Now I didnt feel stressed about the medication because it is not complicated at all to take. Just take the pill and you dont have to worry about cleansers, toners, etc. I would really reccommend this product and the best part is that it is not as expensive as other products."
"LOVE, love these bags for cleaning the cat litter box! They are just the right size and I have had no problems with them at all....there was one bag out of the entire box that had a gap in the bottom seam but that's it. When Irecently ran out, I picked up a different brand at petco...never again...they were too small and lots more expensive. Will get the dogipot bags from now on!"
My husband has very dry skin. This Olivella Olive oil is great it is the first thing that is working for him.
"Sadly, Bill Blass (their fragrance line was bought out by another company) has discontinued this scent and so I am buying every bottle I can find. The scent they are replacing it with is not even close and I am incredibly alergic it. It is a sad, sad time"
"The object of the game is to build a cootie-- body, head, legs, eyes, etc. A person must first roll a one to get a body, then a two to get a head, then other numbers to get other parts. This afternoon it took FOREVER for my 5 year old to roll a one, then a two. (She wouldn't play any other way except by the rules, and those are the rules). My 3 year old couldn't concentrate long enough to get enough parts to build a cootie, although he did pretty well. We finally stopped and just built cooties. The parts don't fit well. Little kids need help putting in the parts, and the parts fall out too. Not fun."
The Jergens Cherry Almond Scent Lotion is one of the best products that I've ever used. It has a refreshing aroma. The lotion wasn't greasy and left my hands and feet feeling very soft after only a couple of applications. I highly recommend this product.
"Our house has an open floorplan, and we were needing something to block our new puppy from our bedroom. We read all the most helpful reviews first, and then decided on this gate that -- with extensions -- would barricade a 44"" wide space. Our installation would be at about a 20-degree angle in order to use both our fireplace and a doorframe as ""walls,"" and we were hopeful, but not very. Thanks to the many hints, it took only one person to get the installation *successfully* accomplished in less than 10 minutes. The rubber caps are large enough in diameter to grab both the brick and the painted wood surfaces, even at an angle. We didn't even need to use (but didn't toss!) the optional endcaps. This gate is quite rigid and immobile when installed, and seems rugged in construction. The bars are less than 3"" apart, which has stymied even our cat. We consider this a plus! The gate features a small pet door centered in the gate, which we won't be using now; but may, if we need this in another area for a different purpose. For all its permanent feeling, it is easily loosened to move wherever. This gate was an exceptional value, about $7 cheaper than WalMart (where it was out of stock), and shipped for free to my door, three days earlier than expected. Great product, great buying experience."
"We originally bought this game at the Chiricahua National Monument in Arizona for our kids (8 and 10 years old at the time) and they loved it. We love that it's Monopoly, but one that creates interest in visiting our national parks."
My husband and I were introduced to the game of Mexican Train while on a sailing trip with friends. It was a hit with everyone and we kept a running record of our scores for at least three days. We enjoyed playing it this summer at a family reunion with the ages of the family members varying from 8 to 72. The eight year old won the game!
"I was so excited to finally recieve it in the mail. It was easy to set up but you have to hold down the button the whole time. The tape was education, but the projection was horrible. It casts a bunch of blury shadows of stars on a nearby wall. Even in the pitch dark you couldn't read the names of the stars unless you put the globe within a foot from the wall. It was a huge disapointment."
Product description states it is suitable for cats. It is not. Anything larger than a ferret will need to be leashed and have its head sticking out the top. A cat will not accept this. The seller / manufacturer has misrepresented the product and therefore gets major thumbs down from me.
My shih tzu/maltese mix loves this toy. It gives her something to work for and it works well. You can make it easy or difficult by just twisting it. The only downfall is that it's hard to buy treats small enough that would fit and dispense easily so I took her favorite treat and broke it up in small pieces and it worked out great! Great durable toy for small type dogs.
"I just love this new hair tool. Wish I had purchased one a long time ago. The wide plates straighten my hair in half the time, and leave it shiny. My naturally frizzy, wavy hair even stays straight in humidity. Must be something about steam ironing that makes it look better and last longer. i do dry it about half way with a blow dryer before using the wet 2 straight, and also use a heat protectant product on the lower half of my shoulder length hair. This straightener doesn't catch and pull my hair the way some much more expensive straighteners do. It's a gem!Be sure to press the plates together where the finger marks are located to get the best tight close on your hair, and the smoothest effect."
"I Really Love This Product!!!!!, I wear locs and the Organix Hydrating Treatment softening them instantly & locks in moisture without the heavy build up. I've tried other products but this is the best! It's becoming hard to find locally, so I hope they are not planning to discontinue it!!!"
"I have used the gentle leader for at least a couple of years now. I have two little 20-25 lb. dogs that I walk twice a day with them on either side of me. When they were still puppies they would choke themselves with traditional collars trying to run ahead. When I used a harnass they would still pull. However, once I switched to the gentle leader they became much calmer. It's not perfect. They still try to pull when they see another dog or a cat, however, they are easily controlled and for most of the walk they trot along perfectly beside me. I've already worn out the first gentle leaders I bought and just purchased two more."
"My 7 pound dog would climb all over us while trying to drive because he wanted to see out the window, a friend had this car seat and it was the best $60 bucks I spent. I never write reviews but I had to because it's working so well for us. He hasn't climbed in my lap one time since we put it in the front seat, and I do not strap him in with the buckle that came with.I thought a car seat for a dog, you don't need it but yes you do!"
"I have four dogs so I thought this collar would be the perfect solution to the foul smelling collars they become after a few months!! I was right!! I have had this collar, in orange, for a few months now and it is still as good as new! No smell and it is so easy to clean! The orange looks great on my little black pug! The other 3 are waiting on their's now!! Great product!!"
"I don't know WHAT they put in here, but ever since the first time I smelled it, it makes me weak in the knees. I quite literally swoon. As a previous poster noted, I too, am drawn to the wearer as if by invisible string. I've walked up to complete strangers wearing it and said ""MMM, Fahrenheit. Nice."" This pleases them to no end.Take it from a woman, guys- you can't go wrong wearing this. The makers of Axe toiletries can imply whatever they like in their TV commercials, but this scent alone is the only one that's ever come close to eliciting a response like that (from me, anyway). My boyfriend, who is ordinarily indifferent to colognes, loves wearing this one, just for the response he gets from me. Maybe they've perfected pheremone synthesis over at Dior. Whatever the secret ingredient is, it works."
"Instead of just part of a TENS electrode sticking to your skin, these little wonders make the whole surface cling handily--which means you get more benefit from the TENS electrodes. It also keep thr surface stickier upon removal so that you may get additional usage from your electrodes.I have sensitive skin, allergies and psoriasis and these have never irritated my skin."
"my first time buying perfume, so i ordered 2 bottles. both did not smell good- probably sitting on a shelf or a warehouse for years & had gone bad."
"A good xylophone is hard to find, and unfortunately this isn't one of them. When making a musical instrument such as a xylophone, the very least one can do is create one with the correct pitch. This atonal mess is good for teaching kids how to play percussion only; might as well buy a drum. I disagree with other reviewers that incorrect pitch is harmless - kids learn at an amazing speed, even as babies, and as they get older they will want to play the songs they love! I would not buy this xylophone when there are so many others to choose from."
"This product is getting very hard to find in my area, so I was delighted to discover I coudl still buy this through Amazon. This is a great scent."
This is just the right size for my 5 month small breed pup and it's her favorite so I'm getting a backup. Her little paws can hang on to the loops while she attacks other loops like a raptor and it rolls in a wobbly way.
"I bought this to try after reading all of the reviews and decided to try it. I wasn't disappointed with the results. At first, I was skeptical because alot of these volumizing products leave a sticky residue and flakes in your hair and scalp. This product didn't leave me with stickiness or build-up. I would recommend this product."
other than the minor smell that takes a bit to get used to..this gelly worked wonders for smoothing out my face..everything from little heat rash..to zits...to just scars....its not oily its easy to use..you don't need much..and it works
I love this toy.My mom brought me TWO secret date bratz dools.I think that this is a wonderful toy for girls of all ages.SO you other parents get real cause we're NOT going to stop selling!
"I tried ordering from another company and got the shaft. Never received the product, only a rude e-mail. My credit card company thankfully refunded the money and I'll never order from anywhere else. Thank you for saving me money and time going to the vet to get this much needed product. It has gotten rid of a nasty flea problem my indoor cat somehow got. The shipping was quick and people courteous. Thank you very much!"
"This contraption latches at the dial, which unlatches at the desired time. On the far end, the latched door has about 1cm of play, and it is trivial for a finger or a cat paw to get between the door and the lip. It is then easy to force the thin food dish out through the latched lid, even without opposable thumbs or a homo sapiens intellect.I put food in this unit and set it for 12 hours. I placed the unit on the floor. My cat began attacking it, and was noshing within 10 minutes. Amazon.com is making it easy to return, so I guess I'll try another feeder."
"We recently adopted 3 wonderful, adorable pups - 2 of whom are still in their ""chewing stage"". Based on the recommendation of friends, we decided to give the ""Kong"" a try - and it's awesome!""Kongs"" are made to be extremely strong, so they don't fall apart when the little ones chew on them for hours (or even when our big guy decides to have a little chewing action on it himself). We've found that our dogs love them as is, but they REALLY get into it when we insert a treat or some of the ""Kong"" vitamin-enriched tasty paste into the open cavity. They'll spend lots of time and energy attempting to get the treat out (which is unlikely) &/or enjoying the ""tasty paste"".Overall, we found this to be a great toy for our ""little ones"" - it provides them with something that they're allowed to chew & that I as a ""puppy parent"" don't have to worry about falling apart due to long bouts of gnawing. Our dogs give the ""Kong"" a ""2 paws up""!!!"
"Great way to help children learn alphabetical order, sounds, letter recognition. Fun to play & has a great self-check component. Recommend for all parents with preschool children."
"I like the scent of Wish, but I love Casmir even more! The price cannot be beat for either bottle and the service was great."
"This is a great toy,when you push on the heads it go's and go's for a long ride.The faces look like the Wiggles and my toddler knew right away it wqas the wiggles,she loves it,and loves the Wiggles guitar,great toys,thank you Amazon for selling them on your site,Wiggles toys are hard to find."
"I first got these treats from my vet. My puppies loved them. The Lean treats are small and a great size for training. Being that they are lean makes them healthier for them.I have a tendency to ""over treat"" so by giving them the Lean treats I am at least treating them with a better treat.I order these all the time."
Figured it was worth a try to see if it kept the cat away from the Christmas tree. Not sure that it worked. Cat would run when I sprayed but seemingly came back nearly immediately. I could have sprayed water and had a similar effect.
"MY 7 YR OLD SON GOT THIS FOR CHRISTMAS AND REALLY ENJOYS PLAYING WITH IT. THOUGH THE SPEED WAS FAST, HE QUICKLY MASTERED THE SKILLS NEEDED TO PLAY WITH IT. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS IT HAS USED THREE SETS OF BATTERIES (ALKALINE) SO QUICKLY!!! NEVER HAD THIS TYPE OF PROBLEM WITH ANY OTHER TOY!! BUT HE LOVES IT SO WE JUST KEEP BUYING MORE BATTERIED."
"I have two cats. The female is 7 and the male is 5. For the past 4 months or so, the female has been peeing out side of the litter box. (Not all over the house, just on the mat outside the box.) The litter didn't work. Don't get me wrong - the male cat came over and started rubbing himself against the bag of litter. He loved it. It just attracted the wrong cat - - ha ha. I even bought the Cat Attract that you sprinkle in yourself, thinking maybe the original wasn't strong enough for my stubborn cat. No dice.BUT- I'm giving it 3 stars because I do believe SOME cats are indeed attracted to it. Too bad it wasn't my female cat!"
"I have purchased product after product for my hair. I have curls, but my hair needs help to really go the way it should. Otherwise, it's just a thick, frizzy mass.I put this stuff in my hair, finger curled the hair a bit as usual, and off I went. I started getting all kinds of compliments about how nice my hair looked. I don't normally-- usually my hair is a big mess, no matter what I put do to it. With this product, in the wind, my hair would blow around like normal hair, but it didn't frizz or lose its curl. I'd catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and wonder how my curls were behaving. It was Curls Rock! It does make your hair a little bit crunchy if you put too much in, but you can kind of play with it to make that go away.This week I ran out of this stuff. I couldn't find it in the store, so I bought something else. Mistake. My hair is back to its old, ugly self. And I'm back to ponytails until the shipment arrives!"
I have used this lotion for many years and would recommend it to others who have problems with dry skin. A little goes a long way and buying it in this size will make it last over a year using it at least 2 times a day. The cost is very reasonable when you will use it over a year.
"I bought this for a birthday gift for my husband. He likes it, and I love it. Expensive perhaps, but worth it. Now I just need to wait for him to finish the bottle of that old stuff he has."
"We have an older version of this toy (only three different shapes on ours) that we have had since my second child was a baby. Now baby number six is using it and they ALL have loved it! It's one of the few toys I've saved between kids and I'll most likely keep it for all my future kids and grandkids!I take issue with the complaints that children don't play with the toy ""properly"". Are we dictating how children should play, now, too, as well as learn?? Even babies have to follow the rules and do things according to someone else's pre-determined idea of ""proper development""? PLEASE!! Let's let babies be babies. True learning is self-directed, not teacher or parent directed.Yes, toddlers usually prefer to dump the blocks out and put them back in without the lid at first, maybe for quite a while. They also love putting other stuff in the bucket. What's wrong with that? When they're older they usually figure out the shape-sorting aspect on their own and become enthralled with that for a while. If they never use the toy as a shape-sorter so what? They'll still learn their shapes on their own without you ""teaching"" them and they'll learn whatever other ""skills"" this toy is supposed to teach as well. Can we not try to controll our kids' learning at such a young age - there's enough of that later for most kids.This toy is a useful learning tool, though not neccesarily in the way every parent will want. It's also fun and relatively cheap and more durable than a cardboard box or some homemade alternatives. If you can allow your child to use it as they desire I highly recommend it. If you feel your toy ""investment"" must pay off with a pre-determined ""learning objective"" on a pre-determind timetable then maybe you better skip it."
"My daughter loved this from the start. The play seemed very intuitive for her. I myself have 2 problems with this and they both have to do with the mirror/flip book section. My daughter is constantly pulling it off of the device. She is strong but by no means a Hercules. The back of the mirror piece has 2 sharp pointy prongs which are supposed to hold it in place, but obviously don't. She's so proud every time she tears it out but I'm afraid she's going to poke herself with the prongs. Maybe if the pages were not so awkward to turn she wouldn't pull it out - the awkwardness is the second problem. If this were taken care of I would give it the 5 stars my daughter thinks it deserves."
I ordered this game for my teenagers and we all enjoy it.We also get together with our neighbors for Sequence nights.
"While the toy is cute and cuddly, what actually provides the most entertainment is the webkinz web site. The toy provides access to the website where they can name their toy and play games."
"The Smart Splash Sail Away Shapes are a pretty good set of boats that teaches the concepts of colors and shapes. My son first started playing with this set when he was about a year old. Now, as a 2-year-old, he is able to quickly match the shapes without any problems. Each boat has a cutout of a shape (circle, square, triangle, etc.). The bottom of each sail has a corresponding shape that fits into the boats. When it was brand new, my son had some problems pulling out the sails and fitting them inside the cutouts of the boats because the fit was pretty tight. However, after many uses, it became a little easier to push the sails into the boats, and by that time, my son had developed a little more strength in his fingers to wedge the sails in.The boats are all very colorful and attractive. The boats themselves are made from a thick rubbery material that is kind of soft at the top and bottom of the boats; I was able to push down a little on them with my fingers. Each of the boat's sails are made from a hard plastic material. My son played with these boats so much, every time he took a bath, that one of the bottoms of the boat developed a crack in it. I had to eventually throw out that boat because of a little bit of mold that collected inside over time. Another downside to this set is that the boats don't link together very well when they are floating in the water. The motion of the water causes them to become separated quite easily, but this is not a very big deal for me. My son was happy to just float the boats individually in the water.Overall, these boats are a good set of toys for bath time. They are educational and, over time, they help young toddlers strengthen their cognitive and fine motor skills. Plus, they are fun to play with in the bath tub."
Great product. My baby love this toy. It keeps her entertained. Great music and songs. It plays ABC and 123. The only drawback is for baby who just started standing and holding onto objects. My baby would hold onto this and sometimes it tips over.
"Great toy. I saw my 14-month-old grandson was fascinated by this toy at a birthday party so I ordered one for him. He loves it. Also,the music it plays is very pleasant and doesn't drive you crazy."
Got the 30lb bag on Amazon at $9 less than the local petstore. How excellent is that??? - Better price and good to have it delivered to my door! My pup has been eating this premium dog food for years....it's got all the good stuff and none of the bad!
"A great game if your looking for some strategic game play in the LoTR universe. Huge map, great parts, nice looking cards and much replay value. Well worth the money for such a nice board game."
"When they say this ball is indestructible, they mean it! It has been through three dogs now, and going strong. I accidentally ran over it with a tractor and flattened it completely,but within three days it was back to it's original shape! I drilled several holes in it so she can carry it back when I throw it. I just purchased another just in case this one gets lost!"
"In 2004 my weekly hair cuts in NYC was approaching $20 + tips and to save money I bought this clipper for $25. My purchase was on a trial basis because if I couldn't learn to use it without butchering my hair it was getting returned. The Wahl HomePro Adjustable was very quick to learn and is very easy to use for regular folks cutting their own hair in their bathrooms.Every Friday morning I've used it to cut my naturally short and curly hair during the last 7 years without any issues. Even when I went to London and Paris in the summers I took it along with a travel adapter. In Paris it worked but in London the AC/DC current was different and the Wahl would vibrate super fast to use safely. So I bought a comparable European clipper at Boots Pharmacy that I keep at my Aunt's house in North London.During the previous few weeks my Wahl was not cutting sharp like it used to. I unscrewed the shear plates and cleaned it out with clipper oil. Still the shears were hardly cutting my hair because it had gotten dull from 7 years of continuous use. I un-boxed and starting using an Emerson clipper that my brother got me a few years ago for Christmas. It was then that I realized how good my HomePro Adjustable was. The Emerson felt like a plastic toy in comparison. I went out and bought another Wahl Homepro brand clipper but found it impossible to use because it lacked the adjustable lever. So I came back to amazon and bought the exact model I had before.After 7 years of use it has proven to be the best thing ever and I 100% recommend it.At $20 + 5 tip x 52 weeks x 7 years I saved $9,100 on account of spending $25 to buy the Wahl HomePro Adjustable.PROS:-Has a nice hefty weight to it which gives it a good balance and feel in your hands.-Super easy to use, blades are smooth and comfortable to the touch.-Comes with adequate attachments and instruction VHS.-Shear blades dismantle easily and quickly for cleaning and replacement.-Easy to travel with.-Proven Lifetime quality.-Great price and value for what you are paying for.-Adjustable Lever makes a HUGE difference for fine tuning your hair cuts.CONS:-I couldn't find replacement shear blades anywhere for this particular model and the ones I did see for other Wahl models cost as much as an entire new Wahl clipper.-Over the years I learned Clipper Oil is crucial to the performance of the blades but the kit comes with a one-time use miniscule tube of clipper oil. Some other clippers come with free big bottles of the stuff but you will have to buy your own here.-Did not work in the UK because of the AC/DC current differences.-I wished the power cord was longer but if you get an extension cord you can easily remedy this.-It is not a quiet clipper but it is not super loud either. I noticed some folks commented on newer model clippers being silent.This is not a con for me but still it will be for those that like to cut their hair in their local Library.-For those looking to cut the hair 'down below' keep in mind this is not a small clipper. It vibrates quickly and is louder than smaller clippers. Also the edges of the shear blades protrude out some and are pointy and sharp. So any soft and sensitive areas below your belly button and above your knees you may want to approach with caution."
"This is BY FAR the best thing to ever happen to my hair. I have VERY course, thick hair and this is the only thing that tames it. I am on my third one by they last at least 5 years."
I have a dog and 2 cats.This product seemed like a great idea
"cool ... I like everything .. the product is genuine ... perfect for me ... I love this perfume, I recommend it 100% percent ... thanks for the good care .."
This is a great 2-4 player game! I found this game because my husband is interested in adventure computer games. This is something we can enjoy together. My husband and I learned how to play during a rainy Saturday afternoon. Great online tutorial.
"My girlfriends dog had a sever break out and we were given this product by her vet. It was half the size and 2.5 times more in price. I google the product and found it here on amazon, the bottle was twice the size and only a fraction of the price. I was upset with our vet because of the price lol. But Im very pleased with this product and the price."
"I started using this product approximately 7 years ago after reading an article promoting Desert Essence products. I have found it the best to handle any type skin. It does it all. Cleanses, conditions, and controls blemishes. It is concentrated and a little bit goes a long way. Your skin feels clean and healthy, not stripped and irritated as some other cleansers.I have always purchased it at the health food store in the smaller pump style at a fairly high price. Until I found it here on Amazon, I didn't realize it came it the large economy size. Price was great, shipping cost was more than reasonable, and I received the product quickly. At this price I can afford to use it for bathing as well. Great product at a fantastic price, need I say more?"
"I couldn't wait to get this for my daughter. I bought it for her last Christmas when she had just turned 2. She was already able to recoginize letters and numbers at that point, so I thought this would be great. She loves it!!! The only problem is that we are on our third one in less than a year and this one is giving us problems. The first one was exchanged at Toys-R-Us, no problem. The next two by Leap Pad themselves. I wouldn't mind the problems if my daughter abused the leap pad. She doesn't!!! It stays in a basket with all of the cassets and books when not in use.(This way they are all in one place!) It is frustrating to her when the machine suts down on it's own; says ""This is not a my first leap pad cartridge"" and it is; and the pen doesn't always work. Call me crazy, but I'm about to purchase the regular leap pad because I think it has more to offer her now. Great for learning, but not great if your kids don't keep their toys well or even if they do!"
my mom bouught me an iquest for my birthday and i love it! its a fun and easy way to study for test. i recommend this item for any kid who is having trouble in any subject.
"I grew up playing this game, then introduced it to a bunch of freinds who are now hooked! I still use the version I have from the 80's & honestly didn't even know it was still being produced until just now, so I'm buying a new set!!!"
"This game was bought for my son for his birthday to accompany his brand new leapster 2. It plays through the intro and freezes up upon starting actual game play. To rate this on its educational value is pointless unless it is providing a lesson in aggravation. We returned our first copy to the store. With the second copy, and third copy, same thing happened. All the while other games my son received work perfectly. We contacted Leapster. They sent us a new copy of the same game. Same thing all over again. I have had it. I contacted them and requested a different game. The flaw is in the programming. No other game does this in my son's leapster console. Avoid it if your are getting your child a Leapster 2."
"I am in love with Aphogee Keratin and Green Tea Restructurizer. It has made all the difference in strengthening my hair and stopping breakage. I am of African American descent and a alot of the times I felt nervous about doing my own hair and would only make trips to the salon. With this product I don't see hairs coming out in the comb, they actually stay on my head now. My hair needed the protein that this product offers and gives me the confidence to blow dry and style without any worries. Try it, you might make it a staple of yours like I did."
"1. Included batteries were dead on arrival.2. With replacement batteries installed, collars were used as directed. They had no noticeable effect on the incessant yapping of either dog."
"Like some of the other reviewers, I did a lot of research before deciding on this food. (Want your eyes opened? Read ""7 Scary Things You Didn't Know about Your Pet's Food."" But if you're reading about this product, you probably are already aware of the low quality of grocery store cat foods.) My cat is a dry food addict and though I've tried every (healthy) suggestion out there, I cannot convince him that wet food is anything other than a snack. So I decided to at least feed him the healthiest dry food that I can afford rather than Meow Mix.There are some better dry cat foods, but they are only a little bit better and they're a lot more expensive. Some of them cost $10 a pound. At that price, I'd be better off feeding my cat from the meat department at the grocery store. Free range, organic chicken doesn't even cost $10 a pound. (Amusingly I just spotted where Amazon.com claims a list price for the 6 pound bag of the Chicken Soup Cat Senior as $149.49. That's $24.92 a pound!! You could feed your cat steak for less than that.)This is a high quality cat food with an ingredient list to put a smile on your face. For what you're getting, the price is reasonable though it's still more than the Meow Mix. The product is not carried locally. So I was happy when I found it on Amazon.com, as since this item qualifies for free shipping, that is what makes it affordable to me. (If I had to pay the over $14 shipping on it, I'd be better off going to the pet store and buying Blue Buffalo at $2.29 a pound. With the free shipping the Chicken Soup is $1.57 a pound. Without the free shipping it's $2.36 a pound.)Those were my reasons for choosing Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul from Amazon.com.Now how did my Meow Mix loving cat feel about it? When I opened the door and carried in the first box, my cat immediately started rubbing up against it and acting all excited. I had had this plan to slowly transition the cat by mixing it with the Meow Mix. But he was so enthusiastic just at the smell that I immediately opened the box, cut open the bag and offered him a handful. He dove right in. He absolutely loved it! (Now I was bit taken aback. I was so used to multi-shape, multi-color cat food. This food has no dyes. All the kibbles are the same X-shape and they're all brown.)I never did finish that last bag of Meow Mix. I just started putting 100% Chicken Soup in the bowl. I just ordered his third bag and he still loves it every single day.The cat used to throw-up the Meow Mix every so often. But I haven't seen him vomit up the Chicken Soup at all. So apparently it agrees with him better. I haven't noticed any kind of stool problem. (But to be fair, the cat didn't have diarrhea on the Meow Mix either.)I feed him the same amount as I did the Meow Mix"
"Let's just say I was skeptical. My friends used to marvel at my collection of used cosmetics and cleansers. After 20 years of trying every cleanser I possibly could on the market, from upmarket to cheap cleansers, I still hadn't found the perfect one and thought I never would. Every cleanser I use either dried my skin out, or made me break out. Anyway, I was getting desperate and began looking at reviews of face cleansers and stumbled across this one. I frankly had never heard of it (it's always on the bottom shelves at the drug stores) and probably would never have tried it because of it's boring packaging. Anyway, after reading tons of good reviews on various sites, I bought some and have been using it for about 3 months now. I can't believe the difference! This cleanser is honestly the best cleanser I've ever used. It doesn't have any unnecessary fragrances or other ingredients, it keeps my skin soft and smooth, I don't break out, I save money on moisturizer because I don't have to slather it on anymore, it removes my makeup easily and I LOVE IT!!! I wish I would have found this 20 years ago before I wasted all my money on those bottles of cleansers. My skin actually glows now. I highly recommend this product to everyone. You won't regret trying this."
"Just a warning,,as someone else stated this will not stop an agressive attack nor will it stop a pitbull. I have a greyhound that was attacked by a pitbull and I actually had to jump on the pitbull and wrestle it off as the direct stop was no more effective then spraying the pit with Chanel number 5. Once we were ""attacked"" but some little yappy mutt type dog and it did make the dog hesitate for a few moments which was long enough for us to get away ( generally greyhounds won't fight) but if you are looking for something to stop a real all out attack, this won't do it. I am pretty sure the directions even state it will stop mild to moderately agressive attacks ( it also says it won't work on bears,,,well duh) so you know what you are getting. I carry pepper spray rather then this product,,however one more thing. Pepper spray can blow back on the user, if Direct Stop does you'll never know it."
"I read each Amazon review on this product before I made my purchase and so I had full confidence in using this product the night before Valentine's. BIG MISTAKE! I left it on for only 50 seconds and the next day I'm left with a line through my upper lip....I was embarrassed to walk outside with a red looking mustache!I put pure aloe vera on it in hopes for it to soothe the burning, but that was a challenge in itself as well. My face felt so tight, it hurt to open my mouth wide enough to eat anything.Today is day two and I see light peeling and my red mustache is now a dark brownish color. I hope this chemical didn't burn my skin and left a scar! :("
"The 12"" Lara Croft figure is beautifully sculpted, and despite the paint application issues that have plagued NECA's factories, Lara has come out well done. She is the exact duplicate of the 7"" Player Select Lara Croft action figure, with some major improvements (as expected). The 7"" Lara had too many paint application problems which made her look more like a tra..... less of a woman, but I digress.12"" Lara comes with all accessories like her previous 7"" counterpart"
"Wow, what a total dissapointment. If this were a Power Rangers Megazord I would have to give him 5 stars. But as a Transformer, he isn't. Yes, he's got good articulation, but thats it. His normal mode is very ugly, his cab mode does a poorjob of hiding his head and arms. His mini-vechiles don't transform at all, they only make up his arms and legs in super form (Megazord) and they can be swapped around, otherwise they are useless. Energon and Armada Optimus Primes are the worst Primes to ever come out. Like i said before if he were a Power Rangers Megazord i'd say nice homage to Optimus Prime and give it 5 stars, but sadly he's the real thing, and doesn't come close to being a ""transformer"" and only gets 1 star...yuck."
"I bought this at Sally's but wanted to write a review here.This is such a great deal and I had GREAT results! I've been a licensed cosmetologist for 11 years and I do my hair at home.I used this like a Thermal Reconstructor and these were my steps.1. Wash hair with clarifying shampoo. Dry and flat iron hair.2. Apply step 1 from box to hair in small sections staying off scalp and keeping hair as straight as possible. Box says 15 min max time and I left mine on for 20 until my curls were relaxed.3. Rinse hair for 6-8 mins (make sure you take your time and rinse everything or your hair will PERMANENTLY smell like a perm) Gently blow dry hair, use a small amount of heat protectant and flat iron again.4. Apply neutralizer and leave it on 10 mins while making sure hair is lying smooth and flat.5. Rinse for 6 mins and apply deep conditioner for 10 mins then rinse.6. Apply heat protectant and leave in conditioner, dry and flat iron.7. You're DONE! Enjoy your beautiful smooth hair and wait 2 days (at least 48 hours) to wash it.I didn't put enough on 1 spot in the nape area and it's wavy instead of curly now but I can wake up, wash and go with straight hair. No more curls and no more flat iron EVERY day!"
"Lost Cities has captivated my wife and me-- we play almost every other day. The game certainly deserves its accolades, including ""Best Game for Couples,"" by Real Simple (which is how we discovered it). The gameplay is extremely straightforward (imagine two player competitive solitaire)-- it only took about 10 minutes for us to get going, and we haven't stopped since. As you become more experienced, the game will become very strategic, with elements of deception and sabotage. It's great as an after-dinner game, and it'll feed your appetite for puzzles, competition, and entertainment."
"My medium size dog has a tendency to have accidents if left out when I'm gone. This is the perfect solution. It's extra large with plenty of room for him to move around. the top comes off, so it is easy to clean and take the bedding in and out for washing. It was difficult to find a bed that was 24"" x 36"", so it would nice if the manufacture sold beds that fit their products. I added water and food bowls that attach to the sides, so it would be a nice addition too. Also a cover for nighttime would be good. The wood trim looks great in any room and gives it an upgraded appearance."
"I live in a dorm and don't have a lot of time or room to get my hair looking great. My hair is brittle from ironing it everyday and people tell me to chop all of my hair off , but i refuse. I've tried a lot of things like sunsilk TLC, night serum by freida, ect.... I figured a dollar something wouldn't hurt so i bought this at my local walgreens. I put it on after shampooing and blow dried my hair all over the place. I was expecting it to get frizzy and puffy but it was straight and shiny. I'm never buying conditioner again."
"The girth of this clipper makes it too clumsy for a feminine hand and impossible to use to clip the faces, toes, muzzle areas on a small dog. If you are a large man with a giant schnauzer, you might like this clipper. Otherwise, fuhgettahbowdit."
"I used this all the time and my hair becomes soft and smooth. My hair is black but I use this rinse to give myself a rich healthy look when I need it. I love the fact that it colors the hair and makes it really soft and it also smells clean. It lasts for about three washes, but I don't mind reapplying it."
Our 3 dogs love this. We have had one for a long time and it takes the 8 year old lab mix about 3-5 minutes to open and dig out the treats!! We bought this new one and let's just say it has been taking him quite some time. Busy buddy makes great stuff and it is durable. Our puppy and older dog also enjoy pushing the saucer around with their nose.Great BuyDefinitely recommend
"Flavor-doh is the most amazing product I have ever used! I learned about it through my vet. I was having a terrible time getting my pomeranian to take his meds. This is simply amazing! I use the handle of a spoon, scoop out a small portion and simply roll it in my hands with the meds. The meds end up rolled in a neat little ball! He absolutely loves taking his meds now! I was thrilled to find I could order this online,which is much less of a hassle and less expensive too! He loves the chicken. My vet ran out of it and I tried beef, no go. I have used this for several years. I used to dread pill time, now he looks forward to it! He actually sits by the kitchen island every morning waiting for his ""treat""!!!!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!"
"I bought this product feeling confident that it would, if nothing else, smell nice and perhaps make the faded bits of my hair color a little more even. I bought it to *try* to cover or lessen my very white roots. I understand that this product is not meant to cover gray, but based on some of the reviews it seemed like it was worth a shot. I wasn't worried about the mess since I am used to dying my hair with permanent dye.When I first put this product on my hair I was struck by the unpleasant aroma. It is herbal, but in a very medicine-y way. It reminds me of some of those tinctures that chinese herbalists prescribe - they can be very pungent and unpleasant. It kind of grossed me out, but I applied the product liberally to my roots and worked it through the rest of my hair as best I could. (I have long, thick hair that is dyed dark brown.) I left the product on for about 30 minutes since many reviewers said to leave it on longer for darker coverage - it also says this on the bottle. The whole time the smell was nauseating me, but I tried to ignore it. I am shocked that so many people say that it has a pleasant smell.After I rinsed it out, the smell lingered in my hair. I was hoping it would not... shortly after rinsing it out, I actually vomited from the smell. I'm not kidding. Not only that, after it was dry, there was NO DIFFERENCE in my hair color. It did not affect my white roots at all and the rest of my hair looked exactly the same as it had before.Needless to say, I do not recommend this product at all. I am used to dying my hair so I can deal with strong smells, but this stuff was horrible and it did nothing. It doesn't even really condition your hair!!!"
"I noticed that my two cats tend to get into bad habits when they're bored during the day. If I have a particularly busy day and don't get a chance to throw around their favorite toys or play with the mouse-on-a-string, they'll chew things and bother me in the middle of the night - standard bad cat stuff. Enter the springs. They're great because my cats enjoy chasing them down the hallway (they make a lovely sound on hardwood floors) and when my cats attempt to pick them up or stop them they'll often spring away, leading the cats on another chase. They're one of only a couple toys that my cats will pick up and return to me so less spring chasing for me and more for my cats."
The plane was a Christmas gift. We had just got back from a flying vacation. It did not take very long to assemble and was sturdy enough for a 2 1/2 year old to play with.
"LOADS OF FUN!!! For all ages. Adults and kids of all ages enjoyed this game. My 3 year old niece LAUGHED her head off when she got her first bee, and screamed with delight when ever a bee fell into someone's tray.She learned to share and take turns. Eye-hand coordination skills were improved.A great toy!"
Awesome hairsetter. I've owned three of these over many years and really love it. The rollers stay in your hair unlike the clip kind which I dislike because they always fall out of your hair. I received this for a gift and will continue to be a dedicated Caruso customer.
"While the rattle structure is as pictured, the one I received is only black and white and not full of different colors as pictured - a bit disappointing and not as fun for a baby."
"All the reviews are right, this stuff really works. My dog's appetite has greatly improved, as has his energy and kidney values. Highly recommended."
"I wrote this review because I did not think this game should be rated so low. My son picks Cars to play everytime we get Vsmile out. I like it because he is able to drive a car on the road with out the difficulty of bigger systems or arcade games. He is learning while he is playing, too."
I really like this figure. I havn't seen another Emperor Palpatine figure like this! It is really awesome!
i like it i love to collect star wars items i have a hole wall shelf full and this has just added the true fun you dont hAVE TO BE A KID TO INJOY AN GOOD TOY SUCH AS THIS I JUS T WOOD LOVE TO SAY THANK YOU
"I bought this recently for my daughter's birthday. All the kids at the party went wild when she opened it. I think kids are all reacting to the hype they hear about this toy. None of the little girls who were at the party actually have one yet. They may be dissappointed like my daughter was. The internet play with the animal is less then impressive. It's very similar to playing on Neopets.com, except that your pet isn't gogni to die if left unattended for too long. My daughter actually played on Neopets, but I'm the only one who has shown any interest in goign to the Webkins site to see what is was all about. It's cute, but not much fun. You have to earn a lot of points to buy things for your pet, including food. You bascially have to spend more time earning points than playign with your pet. I can see where kids would lose interest very quickly with this. I suggest just setting up a free account at Neopets.com before buying this item, to see if your child would hold any interest in the online part of this toy."
"A wonderful item to develop interest & coordination for children.It's simple, washable, safe and fun.I highly recommend it."
"Most of the reviews here mention problems with the joystick on this. I've only played for an hour or so and haven't noticed a problem yet -- though (as many have mentioned) it does seem particularly quirky on Ms. PacMan.It's too bad, because the software and gameplay seem EXACTLY like I remember them (though I haven't found the Xevious Easter eggs I recall). I hope the joystick holds out because I'm looking forward to blowing lots of evenings blasting down memory lane.I hate when good ideas are ruined by cheap/shoddy implementation. As of this moment, I can neither confirm nor deny, but anyone considering buying this should mentally prepare themselves for that rather strong likelihood."
"I got this for my daughter for Christmas, and she loves it. She just turned two and is already playing make-believe with this set! She loves putting the mom, dad and baby in the different rooms, and when I ask her if she wants to go potty, she'll put the baby on the potty too! Its a perfect first dollhouse for the price and value!"
"Years ago I had a saxophone neck strap with that exact kind of clasp on it. After about the third time I caught my 1960 Selmer Mark VI tenor by the thumb hook, I scrapped the strap. The problem with that kind of hook is if you attach it to a small ring, the proximal side of the ring can push on the opening mechanism while giving the distal side leverage to push through the opening."
My hair grows nicely but I cut it recently and wanted it to grow back quickly. These pills didnt work at all I followed directly as it said. Complete waste of time and money all it did was mess with my bladder every day I took the pills I pee'd like 15X's a day seriously!!!! Soon as I stopped my bladder went back to normal.
My son is 2 years old and loves dinosaurs. I bought this for his Leap Pad and he has not put it down for a week now. I would not recommend this for every 2 year old but he is very careful with the books and takes good care of this toy. Lots of dinosaurs and information about them. We are learning a lot!
"I read this book along with my son who was required to read The Westing Game for his 7th grade Language Arts class. I enjoy books very much and I like all kinds of different books- as long as it is a good story. The Westing Game was here, there and everywhere. It was difficult to follow and not interesting enough to really care. I hung in there and completed reading the book because I thought it had to have a great ending if it was a requiured read at school. Boy was I wrong. What a waste of my time and interest. I would not recommend for anyone to read this book."
Energon Megatron is large and in charge. its bulky and isn't well articulated but it over comes that with its shear awesomeness factor.vehicle mode
"The comb is not as pictured. The ""wide"" side is pictured with 23 teeth, it actually has 30. I bought it because I have thick hair and I need wider teeth to comb through my hair after I wash it. This comb cannot comb through my hair, wet or dry."
"My 3 year old stepson received this for Christmas and he loves playing with it! That is when his dad and I aren't playing with it! Simply press him forward and he flips backwards, viola! I must say that we were surprised when he landed on his feet not only once, but over and over! The 3 year old wasn't to worried about trying to knock down the wall, but he loves making it flip backwards to hit the cats!"
I bought this item for my Cairn Terrier. He weighs 20lbs and I purchased the medium size. He loves it!Quick ship. Easy to put together.
"Our puppy loves his Tuggy, and his cousins love to play with it too!Our first Hartz Tuff Stuff Retriever (one of the names on the label is ""Tugger"", which of course became Tuggy in no time flat), lasted quite a while, though when he began teething his molars, pretty much nothing lasts for too long. It works as a ""tug of war"" toy and a plush toy, is good sized, and even when he succeeds in getting through the cover, forcing us to remove the copious stuffing and squeeker, the rope core remains, giving the carcass lots of entertainment value.Since our puppy is a heavy chewer, we buy a few at a time to qualify for free shipping, so its a great value. So far, we've recieved a variety of colors in each shipment, so if you buy several for multiple dogs, each can get their ""own"""
This is a wonderful little harness for our little boy chihuahua dog. The fit is true to what the size chart says. And it is so cute on him. It is lined and we like the quality.
"I have a 2 year old Yellow Labrador that has been battling an allergy for the past few months. We were told to try this food as a way of eliminating unnecessary ingredients to see if the allergy was indeed food based. First off, contrary to her breed characteristics, my lab is a picky eater. She usually leaves the dry food sitting until we mix in some wet food, or until she's really hungry. That all changed with this bag, she sits as we pour it and eats the dry food almost immediately. Score one for the brand. Her allergy seems to have gone away, now that could very well mean she has a seasonal allergy, but could indeed also suggest it was food based. Either way, I'm very happy with the quality of the food and my lab's readiness to eat it. I'll be sticking to Natural Balance LID bags for the forseeable future."
my cat loves this she sits and stares at me then the mouse to see if I am going to pick it up. she will chase the beem for ever if I would let her. shipping though hugh!
This was a great find. Video Nows are not sold anymore and. The child i work with simply loves them. It shipped quickly and was a good price. We are pleased with the product.
This is a great game for two or ten people. It is very durable and easy to play and a very very fun game. I bought it on Amazon.com
This is a great game for people who love Phase 10 but would like a bit more variety. The other great thing about this game is the ability to be able to choose your phase and save cards to use later in the game.
"I successfully transported my cat across the country in this carrier. She's a fairly large cat, but she fit comfortably into this, it met the airline guidelines, and it was easy to carry. The dual-entry points are a nice addition"
Great product for large dogs with serious undercoat and shedding issues. Very happy with the product and the quick turnaround time in getting it.
"I was shopping at the toy store for some figure type toys since our daughter who is 2 1/2 started to play with some knight/horse figures she has. I saw this toy and it came with extra puppies and cats (which is good as initial set only has a couple). She absolutely loves it and can't stop playing with it. She's always asking either me or my wife to sit and play with her. The hamster tube kept her entertained for quite some time as she enjoyed moving it through the tube and down the other side. We have waited before going to by more for the set (saw the playground and that looked real entertaining) to see how long this interest would last. She hasn't lost interest, so we are off to get some more."
"I bought this drum for my neice when she was 6 months old. She was in that banging stage where she hit everything that made noise. She LOVES this drum. She pounds on it and responds to the lights and music. She's a little young to appreciate the alphabet and counting sequences, but the exposure is good for her. As far as durability, she has likes to chew on it and turn it upside down and hit the bottom. She drags it around on the floor and it's held up well so far."
"I bought this for my son that's 2! I've never had trouble putting him to bed , EVER! But I needed something to distract him from being rocked every night, to just being put to bed with a hug and kiss. This works MAGIC! I turn this on every night and for naps and haven't had a problem. He loves to watch his own little ""aquarium""!! Would highly recommend for any age. One question, can I HAVE ONE??!! lol"
"I ordered this for my 5lb chihuahua to help him get up and down from my tall couch. He learned to use it quickly and now uses it regularly. I like that these were easy to set up; unfolding it and sticking on the stair fabric is all that's required. I also like that it can be folded up and tucked away as needed. The one thing I don't like is that it came with grips to stick on the bottom to keep the stairs from sliding, but they don't stay on. This is a minor flaw, however, and I recommend these to other small dog owners."
"it has been more than 20 years that i use chantilly and i will keep on using it because it is all i want in a cologne. sweet, femenine, delicate. i just love it. it is difficult to find but i search all around until i get it and mostly buy at least 2 bottles at a time."
basics is a great product I loved because I have found is that from now on I will have more beautiful skin than I had and I have a few days using it and the change is remarkable zero fat and pimples
"A few weeks after I started using this product, a few of the words on the handle started melting off, what remained read ""Instant Con"". Funny Right? But it got me thnking, I started to wonder if this was healthy for my hair. I dont think the plates are ceramic, so the heating my burn my hair, and secondly, ladies please, if you know for sure ur hair is thin and flat, don't even try this! My hair is SUPER thin, even though it looks thicker than it actually is, and when I used this to brush my hair it just scrapes my scalp. I swear, I have got headaches after everytime I use it!!Maybe if I did some extra work on my hair it wouldnt hurt so bad, but I'd need to have extra time.But hey, my hair was super shiny after I used it, if it didnt hurt so bad it might have acutally felt good!"
We use this product on all 5 of our dogs...they go to daycare and play in wooded areas outdoors. Frontline has kept them free of ticks and fleas.
"Like others who bought this box set, I wanted the Haldir figure, but Legolas, Gimli and King Theoden look like the actors and are finely detailed. The joints are strong plus all the accessories look nice. Aragorn, in my opinion, has never really been done exactly, but this is one of the better attempts. The Gimli is the same mold as the single TWO TOWERS figure, but with orc blood on his armour. Sometimes with box sets that include an 'exclusive' figure, the additional one is somewhat crummy, but the Haldir matches Craig Parker's likeness very well. The only flaw is the paint work. It's well done, but the color is too red compared to reference shots and in the film. Regardless, its a good one to have, and another quality set from Toy Biz."
works great helps calm the itch my miniature dachshundhas. Tip given my our dog groomer. Spray on and rubaround and she loves it!!!
"My nine month old daughter loves this toy. I bought the kitchen because she plays with a larger play kitchen at her sitters all the time. We did not have room for a larger version in our small apartment. Overall it was a good investment as she plays with it frequently. Although she has not discovered the fun of the blocks or the stove yet she does enjoy opening and closing the doors. I wish that Little Tikes would find a way to keep it from turning over so easily though or possibly a way to brace the kitchen to the wall. She has already turn it over on herself several times trying to pull herself up. Other than that we have had none of the issues some of the other reviewers stated. The sound is fine, just loud enough for someone playing with the kitchen to hear, but not so loud that I have to hear it when standing on the other side of the room. We did not have trouble with the phone. Although I have had to go looking for it several times as my daughter tends to crawl off with it.Overall, I would say it was a good investment as she has already spent several hours playing with the kitchen. I hope as she gets older she will learn to enjoy the other activities."
"....though I am sorry to say that it has not cured my MinPin's cataracts (diabetes induced).I can say that these OcluVet drops have helped my dog see better because he rarely runs smack into things like he used to---and I don't mean things that are in front of him that he is used to (i.e. knows where they usually are, like chairs or laundry hampers) but things that someone has recently put in his way. (like a new bag of dog food just brought into the house or a bag of garbage that I've taken out of the can but not taken outside yet)Things that are very close to him he still doesn't see well but his distance/peripheral vision is definitely better than it was before I started the drops. (as if the stops have shrunk the diameter of the cataracts and thinned the thickness of them somewhat)Also, the OcluVet drops may have kept the cataracts from getting worse (bigger and thicker), and thereby leaving him totally blind, as I have been very regimented in applying the drops 3x per day ever since I started using them (and this is my 2nd bottle purchased).They are very expensive for the amount you receive, but they do last a good while--over 2 months for a small dog that only needs 1 drop per eye, 3x a day (any more than one drop just squeezes right out, his eyes are so small)I have had no problems with a leaky bottle, as some people have reported---I just make sure the cap is on tightly and shake the bottle side to side rather than up and down. Also, no problems with too many drops coming out when I squeeze the bottle---I first position the dog, holding his eye open, then turn the bottle upside down over his eye, then very slowly and gently squeeze out one drop.I plan to continue using these drops either as long as I can afford them (and with their price and this economy, who knows how long that will be??) or until they don't seem to be working well enough any more to be worth their price.MEDI-VET ANIMAL HEALTH please take note"
"The best part is this toy is fun even when you turn off the switch. My little one smacks it, rolls and crawls with it all the things she'd normally do with it when its all lit up and playing the music. So if you want quiet time, less music, this toy work great. It is light enough so even if she lifts and somehow bummps her head to it, doesn't get much hurt. btw, the music is soft too, not very loud and noisy!"
I used this for my puppy in training with newspaper instead of puppy pads. Well my pup didn't necessarily make it on the tray all the time. And it was kind of messy to clean up.
"This game is so much fun and it has so many different set ups. I really gets your thinking spatially and with sequences. I would not recommend it for younger kids (under 12) as it can be a thought intensive game. It is not complicated because there are not many rules, one just has to have the ability to think spatially and remember long sequences. I would definitely recommend it to a friend."
I want to say thank you for having them at a good price. 4 other dogs that are the same breeding as mine have die from kidney failure and i hope this will help my 3 small guys. did blood work as of right now they are fineThank you
"I have used this product for several years. The Vet says the enzyme content is key for tartar control. My dogs would eat the whole beef flavored tube if I let them. The toothpaste doesn't make it any easier to brush the dogs teeth but when I call them to brush their teeth they come running. Yum, Yum beef!"
"no compaints in regards to this product, it is comfortable for my pet, and it keeps the bugs away. what more can i say :)"
"Both the Snipers and the Vipers add cool special powers and new tactics to the game. The Vipers are fast (move 7, don't stop for water) but have a defense of 0. Their other power, the ""Frenzy"" is even better than the Vikings - they can move, attack, and roll for another turn. Nothings better than some frenzied vipers dicing up your friends Mimring in one turn.The Snipers are also fun with a neat ability. When they attack, every successful hit counts double. They only have 1 attack die though, so it's good to get them on high ground (+1 die) and then start shooting. They're also helped a lot if you can get them near some of the Heroes of Bleakwood who can add another die."
18 month old loves loves loves his horse! He feeds and waters it. He saddles and unsaddles. So so so cute.
"Until we bought this tool, we never had an effective comb that would remove our dogs undercoat. It has helped to reduce the amount of dog hair we clean up, especially in the spring when out dog begins to shed."
this doggie water bowl is perfect. I took it to work with me at the hotel I work valet at [where we are very pet friendley at] It is now the talk of tow n at hotel zaza in dallas tx
"This product actually works for more than 5 days! I used to use Advantage, but decided to try Frontline instead. Advantage will kill the fleas that are on your dog or cat now. But it doesn't keep them flea free for 30 days like it claims it does. I tried it three times on my cats. After about 5 days, they were back to their usual biting and scratching, and I was back to picking fleas off of them. I finally tried Frontline for the first time, and it's been about 3 weeks and I have't seen a single flea on any of them (I have 7 cats). I haven't been bitten once since I put the Frontline on them. Dont' waste your money on Advantage, buy Frontline."
"I got to say im pretty impressed with these, they are really easy to use and it saves some of the mess. they send a rubber band and I put the liners in and then rubber band them around the litter pan. My cats dont tear them up, and it really dose save time and effort."
"I am a marketing professional so I think I'm ""above"" much of the marketing companies do to differentiate their products/introduce new products. I purchased this b/c I needed a 2nd blowdryer for our vacation home - it was rated well and reasonably priced but I wasn't convinced by this newly boasted ""ion"" technology this and other blowdryers position themselves. But it really made a difference in my long, thick and sometimes frizzy hair! It shortened the time of blowdrying (from 15min with my old dryer to 5) AND the hair was much smoother/more managable. The unit isn't small but the weight some reviewers commented on wasn't an issue for me at all. I highly recommend this!"
"I love pink sugar Aqualina so I ordered it at a good price from Amazon. I noticed by the third day the spray pump was mal-functioning and it does not spray properly. Well, that was a waste of money.Again - the product if working properly is awesome. This was my first and only issue with buying something through Amazon."
Great for kids to learn their letters and sounds (phonics). Kids can use on their own. Durable too
"My two Himalayans are really finicky-very hard to find a really healthy food they like.The LOVE Spa Select, both the dry and canned. They have had health problems, but have no digestive or potty problems. His bladder infection has not reoccurred. This is wonderful. Thanks for making it."
Dog Costume - Hot Diggity Dog Halloween Costume (Hot Dog w/Mustard) - MediumWhat a lovely design!!We absolutely love this costume!
"When I purchased the Gentle Leader headcollar, it completed my collection of every type of collar available to train loose leash dog walking. I have a 13 month old Standard Poodle who has attended training classes as well as 3 weeks of private board and train - it's important to know I have worked diligently with all assignments but to no avail. In my situation, the Gentle Leader works!!! I watched the dvd noting the importance of proper fitting as well as treat enticements. With an uneventful adjustment period, by day 2 we walked 2 miles at the park with complete leash slack. My dog was able to drink water as usual from the dog fountain. We both arrived home happy and tension free!"
I am a K9 trainer and needed a Giant size for a Mastiff. Vari Kennel is the only crate I will use for shipping dogs via air. This particular seller shipped the crate the day payment was received. I highly recommend not only Vari Kennel but the seller as well.
"The unit that hangs around the neck is very heavy. So heavy, in fact, that I have not used it so far. Also, I did not expect to have to shave the neck to create a contact for the two prongs that are supposed to make contact. This is not at all what I expected."
"Terrible! thats all I can say about this product, and a waste of money. Let me give you and idea of how much you will spend on this product how long you will wait and then I will tell you the end result. After shipping and everything came out to about 23$ then they have to ""process"" your order through the company so after 3-4 days latey they finally ship your order. I spent an extra lil dough to ship this fast and still didnt get it until about two weeks later, and this is what I got a lil ity bity jar and a certficate for a discount next time I order from them. Gee thanks! After that you have to go online just to get the proper instructions on how to use it then go out to buy latex gloves, vasline for your hairline so it wont stain your face and a ""tinting brush"". After all this grief I thought finally I will have a lil blue hair tint, because thats all I wanted I didnt want my hair to be as blue as a marker so I opted not to be the bleaching agent and I have medium-brown hair and it did say it would work on that, in the end after all that madness it turned my hair black and my scalp is the only thing that turned blue! Anytime any water would hit my hair here would come pouring out this blue water from my scalp and it got everywhere immean what a mess. Dont waste your time and money on this if you want blue hair or a blue-ish tint to your hair id advise going somewhere else, thats what im going to do. Oh and dont let that picture of the girl with blue hair fool ya she had to bleach all of her hair to get it to that color."
"This is my favorite cleanser for my face. It is VERY good at removing eye makeup and waterproof mascara, yet it is very gentle on the eyes and skin.I like to mix it with mychelle fruit enzyme scrub for the perfect face cleanser."
"Don't do what I did folks. I read the lousy reviews, decided I needed to find out for myself, bought the game that night, and guess what I found out? That I just wasted money! This is NOT your fun, yet challenging trip down memory lane for 20 to 30 year olds like I thought it would be. The questions were impossible to get answers to, took the fun right out of it. The commercial that advertises the game is very misleading; instead of showing pictures of Michael Jordan and Clara Peller, they should be showing the Wall Street Journal and Newsweek Magazine. In fact, this game is ideal for those of you 30somethings that did NOT spend any time watching TV or listening to music when you were growing up. Instead, you were glued to CNN."
"We ordered several of these bowls to use for food and water for our 2 dogs, and were surprised to see how huge they are. They are about an inch larger than described, and our dogs' food seemed lost in them. We will keep them and use them for water, but I don't think they'd work well for dog food except for very large dogs that eat a lot (ours are 50 and 60 lbs. so they're not exactly small dogs). Also the bases of a couple of the bowls are slightly uneven, more like handmade pottery, which gives them some character but might make them a little wobbly."
"This takes a bit of practice to learn, but after a few hands, it's a great card game for playing and visiting at the same time and works wonderfully over the generations - young to wise."
"I bought this toy for my youngest daughter's 2nd birthday and she just loved it. I put it on the fridge with her high chair next to it so when she eats she can play with it. She knew all the letters within a month's time, what they are and what sound they make, also the ""ABC"" song is played over and over and sung over and over. Now after a year she's still playing with it during breakfast and lunch). This toy is definately worth the $18 (eventhough I thought it was expensive at first). I wish there would be something like this with numbers (because she still doesn't recognize all those and there are only 10!)"
"This is a great rc. I'm the mom and I think I play with it more than my son. It's awesome - indoors anyway. We haven't had a chance to take it outside and give it a shot. This rc is tons of fun, and the light show is great! Definite thumbs up!"
I bought this after reading all the positive feedback. When I got it and put a little on I almost threw up it stunk so bad. I don't know what was in my bottle but whatever it was I sure do not want anymore of it. Whatever it was stunk me up my shirt up my hand up and I tried to wash it off over and over again but the funk would not leave me alone. Have you ever been to the zoo and stood close to the monkey cage and you start to smell that funky musty pissy smell. Well it kind of smelled like that but worse. I think someone sold me monkey piss with a hint of monkey ass cheese. Sorry Pi By Givenchy For Men but I want to attract the laidies not a female orangutan. Bye bye monkey piss. Nothing against Pi Givenchy For Men I'm sure it is a good product but I feel I was ripped off and sold a fake product.
"My son really, really wanted this toy. To date, I have been very happy with Hot Wheels products. Unfortunately, this one is a huge disappointment. Like previous reviews, the cars fly off the track, but I think it's should do that, but not before they make it all the way around. Not once, has one car made it all the way around the loop. My son got spider slam though and he loves it. I think I'll return it."
"This is the most awsome educational toy! My 5 year old received it from his grandma for Christmas. I have since purchased the Mr. Pencil Draw and Write program. This is helping him with his writing so much. At first it didn't seem to work well, but then I recalibrated it and it works great. There are so many wonderful games in the base unit. I can't wait to get more cartridges, but at $25 a pop we'll have to add to our collection slowly. The only problem I have with the toy is that my 3 year old wants to play with it too when his big brother is playing. I might have to invest in another unit, but I think it will be well worth it."
"I really wanted this to be my ""signature scent."" But, it's gone in under an hour.... oh well, the smell is very unique though!"
"Hullo friends. WOW is all ah can say. This ship is HUGE! It is almost unbreakable, 'cept for the landing platform, it falls out a little too easily. I have gathered from a previous review that the roomy compartment in front is not a cockpit, it is a ""cokpit"". The ""cokpit"" stores 2 figures easily. the landing platform can also carry a lot of figures. This is a must buy."
"I bought this last Christmas for my kids (ages 9 and 11) from the J.C Penny's catalog. I got the whole family to chip in on one big gift.When the kids opened it Christmas morning there were no mikes in the box (the company shipped them to me after 3 phone calls) , 4 weeks later.My kids both play musical instruments and know how to care for electronics.This machine did not work after 6 weeks of use I would never buy anything else from this company or JS Penny's."
"This is one of the great toys i have i like it so much, well the arms might start to weeken allitle in the future but it is great and i like to stand the doc ock with his tentacles! this toy is awsome"
"Wow! This is a great game. Finally, while the kids are off playing pictionary, us adults have something fun that will show off what we know. As a few reviewers have indicated, steer clear of this game if you enjoy watching Ricky Lake, Oprah, Soap Operas, Temptation Island, Average Joe, or Joe Millionaire. There aren't many questions about these shows and watching them sucks the smarts right outta ya. So, enjoy this game with your family and don't get sucked into the junk on TV."
"AV is the best. I love the fragrance and get compliments all the time. For a while I was giving it as gifts, but it has gotten too expensive. I hope they continue to make it."
"This is a great little mat for my dog. We don't use it as her actual bed - I wish it were more padded on the bottom so we could - but we have this on our rug next to the couch so she has a comfortable place to lie down. She loves it. It is easy to clean and seems to be holding up well. If it were thicker or had more padding, it would definitely get 5 stars (and would have me buying a second for her crate!)."
"I like this conditioner. No issues. I think it is cheaper at local stores, but it was convenient to order online."
"I bought this for our constantly shedding and quite smelly lab as an alternative to a ""traditional"" dog bed that required washing once a week and replacing every couple months. We LOVE it...and so does our pooch. It was simple to put together and is giant (we got the large and it is LARGE!) Our dog likes it because she thinks it is a doggie couch, off the ground, keeps her cool and we throw a towel on it so she has some padding and snuggle material. I also love the value for such a large bed."
"Amazon keeps telling me my package was delivered, but I've been on the phone with the delivery service ""Lasership"" for two days. I ordered one day delivery on Monday and it's now Friday. I'm sitting here with a bleached head waiting to use my dye but woops, it's still not here!If I had realized that ordering one day service off of an amazon prime seller meant wasting my time waiting around for some piece of crap delivery service (instead of the USPS or UPS, why?) I never would have ordered from here.Here's hoping I finally get my hair dye before I have to go to work all weekend looking like a complete idiot."
"I was pleasantly surprised to find that the box was never opened, still plastic wrapped, and it was even packed with bubble wrapped. I would feel more than comfortable buying from this person again. :)Thank you."
"BB Lamb and Rice keeps my two greyhounds in top shape. My male is a very picky eater, and even turns up his nose at homemade chicken and rice, but he bolts this kibble down. I add a couple of tablespoons of BB canned food with warm water to make a gravy on my greyhounds' kibbles, and they love it. Greyhounds require very high protein feed in measured amounts or they don't thrive. I've found this product to be excellent for them."
"This is the best straightener I have ever used. Whenever I don't have much time in the morning, I just wash and dry my hair really quick, and use the straightener. It only takes about 5 or 10 minutes to use on my long hair. It does get really hot, so be careful with it."
"What an excellent hair clipper, works beautifully and can do it in the house as hair is collected not thrown to the floor. We love it!"
"I bought this automatic feeder because my cat requires medicine every 12hrs, which makes vacations and special events difficult. I decided to test my cat's strength and resolve andplaced wet food (without meds) in the feeder. My cat tore the lid off in under 5 minutes!!! As it is, its totally useless, it is held together by plastic snap notches!HOWEVER, when I took it apart I figured out a way to MAKE IT totally cat proof-I removed from the bottom piece the screws that hold the plastic notches in place. This leaves 4 holes that correspond to 4 holes at the bottom of the motor (where it used to snap into place. If you run screws/washers through these holes, and use bolts on the bottom---NO CAT WILL BE ABLE TO OPEN IT!!!! Well, unless he is able to rip thick plastic apart itself. But my cat hasn't been able to do that yet. After about 10 minutes of pawing biting, and growling at the feeder he gets bored and just waits for the feeding time!Good luck!!!"
"I ordered this fountain because my male cat had a urinary blockage and the vet mentioned that water fountains can encourage some cats to consume more water. I ordered the ""Big-Dog"" because I have a total of 2 small dogs and 2 cats. The dogs were a bit scared of it at first but they warmed up quickly. The cats enjoyed drinking from the stream of water. However, the unit is not constructed well. It is made from cheap plastic and has many parts/angles/crevices, which makes cleaning a pain. The water pump is underneath the unit and after a few days I noticed there was water leaking under the unit (I initially thought it was from the animals drinking or playing with the water). There was a crack where the pump attaches to the unit so water was leaking out. I think having a hole in the bottom of the unit to insert a pump is a major design flaw. Even if it isn't cracked you could risk water leakage if the seal is damaged or has any debris on it when inserted. I think a unit with a solid base and submersible pump would be a safer option. Something dishwasher safe would be even better!On a positive note, aside from the sound of the running water, which can be easily adjusted, the unit runs very quietly. Also, it holds a good amount of water so I did not have to refill it often and because it has a filter I did not need to clean out floating debris (pet hair, etc) daily."
"I used Neutrogena for many years when I was in China. I like it. My skin is sensitive. After trying many other creams, only the Neutrogena fits me. The most important is that the price is cheaper than in China."
"one of the best men's cologne ever made.hard to find, amazon always seems to have inventory at a great price."
item arrived quickly and it is what I ordered...the price was cheaper here then anywhere I could find as well...
"We like these Planet Dog Cozy Hemp collars that we purchased for our two yellow labs. They're soft and comfortable for the dogs to wear, and are safe for dogs who wrestle and play with each other a lot, as ours do. Plus, the colors are muted and attractive. However, if you have dogs that pull when on a leash, these collars WILL loosen up and allow the dog to slip out of it, which could be dangerous if you're in an area where there's traffic. For safety, we add a Gentle Lead or a pinch collar if we're going out for a walk, then remove it when we get home and leave these collars on for daily wear and for attaching their ID tags."
"My 3-year-old daughter loves fishing games, so I purchased this for her. It's a cute toy, but the round part of the handle broke off the first night she played with it."
"My 10 months old labradoodle pup loves these. She is normally carefree when someone approaches while she's eating her treats, but she'd growl when she's got these in her paws.The price is right, as the same size bag will cost at least 50% more at a local pet store.The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review is because of the odor. I saw some other reviewers wrote about this, but the odor (especially while your dog is gnawing at it) is VERY strong. The solution I came up with this is to give them to my dog when we leave her in her crate.Over all, this is a good product."
"I have been dying my hair at salons for years when I decided that I should venture out on my own. Actually, my friend mentioned at a dinner party that she uses Loreal. So I actually cancelled my appointment for today and purchased clairol semi permanent color - for the obvious reason - to ensure that I liked the color.Well, the clove color (24) is significantly darker that how it looks on the box. My hair was light brown to start out - now it looks like a fake black/brown color. So, I ran out to the store and bought the light golden brown color (11) - and tried that - same night. But now I have dark dark brown with red highlights. So I washed my hair 4 times and the color is starting to look like dark brown.I still have 7 hours left to sleep, shower again and get ready for work, but I think I am stuck with this color for a few weeks. I really wished I had not tried this color and just gone straight to Loreal."
"I have used all types of dog collars on my 4 legged children, buckle, gentle leader, prong, chain. This is by far the best dog collar. My Akita Bandit loves it. He is so strong I had to use a gentle leader (which he was always trying to get off on our walks). He does not give me a problem walking with this collar. Wish I had known about it years ago for my other dogs."
"So I switched to Organix after feeding my dog Wellness since she was a pup. Her stools had been inconsistent, one day runny and the next day firm. She also had farts that were like WOAH (especially when on the Wellness fish formula). Once I switched to Organix, her stools firmed up and were consistent (and less frequent). She still farts occasionally (who doesn't), but not nearly as often and not nearly as bad. Since this is a premium concentrated dog food without all those nasty fillers such as corn, I don't have to feed my dog as much as I would with, say, Purina. She loves the kibble and gobbles it up every time.She is a 12 pound very active doggie, and the 15 lb bag usually lasts me 3 months.I have found Organix at Whole Foods and Petco as well, but Amazon is the cheapest."
"I bought this for the kids to play at my son's 3rd birthday party. I put the fish in a bucket of water for the kids to catch, as I assumed they would float, but they just sit at the bottom. I guess I thought it would work like a real fishing game, but I suppose it's just intended to play on the floor. It's still cute, but if you are looking for fish that float like I was, this isn't it."
"I just bought a dog this summer, and a friend recommanded K9 Advantix for flea control. My dog did not have fleas problem, I just wanted for prevention. So far after using K9 Advantix for four months, my dog is still flea free. I do take my dog to the park once a week, and around the neighborhood other times."
"well i can't complain about the balls ,brought 1 package seems the shipping and handling was more then the cost of the balls,well that with the fact that petsmart is denoouncing pit bulls rottwieler and other BULLIE dogs fromn thier dog daycare /hotelsi shall join thier boycott of not ever purchasing anything from petsmartshame on them for over charging people like i said the shipping and handling was way higher then the price of the balls"
"If you like Spawn toys then you must get this one. He is the ""most powerful"" version of Spawn, so even if another Spawn is made in the future, that other model still won't be as powerful as this one.Not huying this figure is like buying a David Banner toy, but not a Hulk toy."
"These are the replacement sponges for the Dermanew system. Each sponge includes a foam top section that comes in contact with your skin and a plastic bottom section that snaps securely on to your Dermanew applicator.The sponges are very effective at applying the Dermanew dermabrasion creams. Very gentle on the skin with just the right amount of pressure. Each one also lasts a long time if you clean it after each use. But because of wear and tear and bacterial growth they should be replaced periodically.The Dermanew system is great!(See my review on it) The sponges are excellent. However, I deducted one star because I feel $4.00 is pricey for the item."
purchased the mebro pocket brush and have been very happy with comb.combs hair easily without pulling. it was a good purchase.
"I'm sorry the other reviewer had a bad experience, but I've been buying La Bouquetiere laundry powder for years, and have never had problems with my orders. Occasionally they'll sell out of something and have to back-order, but they've been good about telling me how long the orders usually take to ship. (Shipping is never especially quick, but they don't promise otherwise.)For best service, I'd suggest going to their web site and calling the store in San Francisco."
My favorite fragrance! It lasts all day and fits all my moods. My only dissatisfaction is that a little bit of the liquid leaks during transport.
"I absolutely love this product. I've tried every makeup remover (almost!) out there, and this works the best and is 100% organic and natural. Plus, it smells incredible. I'm telling everyone to buy it. Check out [...]"
"The product smells great and I followed the instructions. It didn't remove the stains off of the floor or the odor. It did mask the odor, but it was only temporary. I wouldn't recommend this product for floors that have old odors/stains."
"I love this dryer! My hair is so thick that it takes forever to dry and having to sit in one spot under a hooded dryer was painful! But not with this one! I love being able to move around. And it dried my hair perfectly. It was so easy to put together and take apart. Best of all, It's so compact that I don't even notice it when stored in the back of the closet, unlike the old hooded style."
"Looks good and works well, but the first one only lasted a year. I took the first one apart and found that the on/off-heat selector switch is very cheap and simply wore out. I only bought the 2nd one because I already have the mounting plate on the wall and thought I might take another chance (hoping that they have improved the switch)). Guess we will see how long the new one will last."
A little pricy but a fun game. The large rollup size is very durable. Great for adults and kids alike.
only reason it got knocked down a start on quality is during high speed tax test one of the weeks cought on edge of road way and ripped the gear block out of fuse. it was repairable but still frustrating. if you are going to land on rough ground often might want to swap out the 4-40 bolts that hold on the landing gear for nylon ones. they should give before the block breaks.
"Just got married and had two cats move in. On day 2, one cat races across the leather sofa and his hind claws dig in. Ouch. How long before the sofa is destroyed?The cats have no front claws but we didn't want to take the rear claws out so this seemed like our last hope. The work fabulously and our cats adjusted to them pretty quickly. My wife is great with them so it wasn't a big deal to apply them though it took a few times to dial in the amount of glue to use. Too little and they fall off in a day, too much and you get hair and crud in them that make the cats uncomfortable.They fall off over the next month but as long as you have two on each paw they keep the cats from digging into the sofa or anything else. Trim their nails before you put them on to make sure that they don't grow into the end of the little boots before they fall off."
"I own a large bulky Remington hot curler set (which I liked accept for the ""clip-on"" marks left in my hair). I purchased the Conair curler set specifically for travel purposes and I have to say, the Remington set went back into its box and up in the closet. I use the Conair set for everyday use now and I love them. The Remington set left my hair kind of ""fly awayish"" from static or something. The Conair set, while giving great volume and curl, eliminates the static, giving a much healthier look and shine to my hair. And the final advantage, there are no clip marks left from use. I am really pleased with this product."
Bear in The Big Blue House has always been a favorite in our house. This was the first Leappad book we bought for my son's Leap Frog and he has spent many happy play hours with it. He already knows the story by memory and enjoys playing the very simple games with Tutter the Mouse over and over again. Recommended for any Bear fan!
"Versace ""the Dreamer"" -- what can you say? I had moderately high expectations for this fragrance after reading some reviews, and they were not only met but exceeded. Some colognes are classy, fresh, professional, sensual... but seriously, the one word that comes to mind with this smell is SEXY! I mean, I would sleep with myself after smelling this. It is so simple when you look at the notes, yet so well done. Refined, semi-sweet, amazing longevity but does not exaggerate just to draw attention to yourself. I'm trying to come up with a situation where somebody could not wear this -- to no avail. These last few weeks with the temperature being around 90 it will disappear a little too quickly and project a little too much. This is a great fragrance to start your fall collection, or to make a great impression on that first date.It does have some pretty good projection and longevity so I would say to start off with three sprays maximum, and maybe build up from there. The tobacco and floral mixes very well at the beginning, and can actually be quite confusing, which gives the scent a perfect name! With the ""Goddess of Sleep"" as a signature, is hypnotic, but also wait for the dry down after about three hours returns very romantic. Definitely a must try, even a blind buy, but trust your nose and the compliments that you receive."
"We've had this attached to our son's crib since birth. He loves the music, but it is a bit loud (I attached foam stickers to the speaker to muffle it to a good level). We apparently had it attached slightly wrong to begin with (slightly angled, not quite vertical) so the mobile didn't move at all (no grinding or indication that it wanted to move, just a stationary mobile), then I accidently knocked it and straightened it (3 months later) and the mobile actually moves to my son's delight! He can listen to the music and watch the mobile for a few pushes of the button (now to teach him where the button to push is..). The moving beads are somewhat loud as well, but they don't seem to bother the little guy and he loves to watch the moving parts."
"I tried this on the recomendation of my vet and so far I really love it. I had been giving oral pills before and the granuals are Sooo much easier. Also, now she is getting much more. The loading dose was a bit to much for her but she is doing great on it now."
My 2 years old already knows what to do and there are different ways to play so you can add more difficulties and challenges as he grows up.Excellent educational game.
"We have a 20lb italian greyhound (she's most likely part whippet) who can be a bit finicky about her toys. She mostly loves furry toys with squeakers, but those usually get destroyed within 24-48 hours. The Nylabones are among her favorites, and she's still working on her first one two weeks later. She's even taken it to bed on a few occasions! Definitely a good way to keep your dog occupied for lengthy periods of time. If your dog is much bigger, I'd avoid these smaller sizes, but for dogs under 20lbs, these should be fine."
"but thought I'd give it a try. I've been using it for about 3 weeks and I can't believe the difference in the appearance of my inherited dark circles. I didn't even buy it for that reason so it's an amazing perk! The texture of my eye skin has improved greatly. I bought it for the crepey appearance starting to set in and while it's not gone completely, it is improved. The size of the lotion bottle kind of scared me given the cost but you learn to become very careful with the amount. I use about 1/2 a pump per eye. I'm sure it has varied results given everyone's skin is different but I will definitely buy this again."
the furminator is amazing using it once a week has helped with the shedding all over the house.
"I can't complain too much cause it lasted 2 years but a hard crate lasts for years and years and is the same cost. You can hose it off, its nice and shady. It has 2 doors, one big and one small. I would like to get another but it just doesn't go the distance."
"THIS TOY IS SO DUMB!!! IM 11 &amp; I LUV DOGS!!!! WHEN I SAW THE COMMERCIAL FOR THIS TOY, I FELL IN LUV WITH IT.I GOT IT FROM MY PARENTS FOR CHRISTMAS! AND I LIKED IT FOR ABOUT 1 WEEK!! IT IS AN ENORMOUS WASTE OF MONEY!! ITS LEGS FALL OF EASILY,AND IF I WERE YOU AND WERE ABOUT TO A ROBOTIC DOG, ID GO WITH I-CYBIE!!"
"This is the second replacement we've gotten and it seems all of them just go off randomly. Not good when you are trying to train the dogs, but at least it only seems to happen when we're inside. So just make sure that you remove the collars when you let the dogs into the house because they will get zapped for no reason."
"I found this in the pet store when I was desperately looking for something to clean my mattress... my otherwise good dog decided to pee right smack dab in the middle of my mattress. I was horrified knowing it had seeped deep into the mattress as she was a large dog. I imagined it would smell like dog urine forever and I'd have to replace the mattress. Well - I poured about 2-3 cups of Natures Miracle over the spot on the mattress, letting it seep in just as the urine initially did. I left it to dry a couple of days and to my amazement I could bury my nose in the now dry area and not smell a thing!!! There was no left over stain, nothing. I think there is something to the weather conditions when you use it though. I tried it another time on the rug when it was a humid rainy time and it didn't seem to work as well. Maybe it took too long to dry, I'm not sure. Regardless, I always have some on hand now. It works for feces as well - same dog had intestinal upset with diarrhea on a cream colored carpet. After cleaning up all the removable material, I saturated the area with Nature's Miracle and voila, no one would ever know what happened, especially my nose!"
"I bought this after being tired of spending 100+ at the salon...and I love it! My hair was a pretty bright blonde and after having this on my hair for 30 minutes, it's now a deep chocolate, everyone is raving about it!"
"I don't know who loves this thing more, my 5 month old, or my husband and I. It never gets boring and its fun to practice your timing, by having certain instruments come in at a different time... my baby goes nuts day after day for this toy. Buy it for every baby shower! I just wish it wasn't so darn expensive or I'd get it for everyone on my baby list."
"This toy was a hit for my friend's son who was two when he received this toy. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the fact that he could swing it around and hit things with it, including their grandfather clock. Otherwise, she (and I with my son) love this toy!"
"This toy's music is a lot of fun. The balls are fun to chase around if your child likes to chase things. You will be in for much exercise after you buy this because the balls more than ""occasionally"" pop out of the funnel. It gets kind of annoying. The product is worth buying though."
"I purchased this hairdryer because I needed one for the type of craft work I do. What is there to say about a hairdryer.....it works just fine, blows out a lot of heat and does exactly what I wanted it to do."
"I really like Bumble and Bumble Thickening Shampoo. I've been using it for about a week now (along with their thickening conditioner and tonic lotion) and I can see a definite improvement in my hair. Beyond thickening my hair, I have noticed more ""oomph"" and volume in my hair and its also smoother at the ends where my hair is even thinner due to breakage. I do agree that this product is expensive, but its worth it. A little DOES go a long way. I would say I use about half as much of this than I would another shampoo (I can't say that about their conditioner though). If you're lucky enough to have a Bumble & Bumble salon in your area, I'm sure you can find this product for less in store. It smells kind of minty in the bottle, but I think it smells kind of like Pantene Pro V Shampoo once I'm done styling. I would also recommend (and use!) B&B Thickening Spray for even more volume and the B&B color support line - I've had great results with the 'cool blonde' formula."
"I was delighted to find these! I have always been concerned about something happening to my home when I was gone, and what would become of my babies! They would be stuck helplessly inside, and just the thought of that so tears at my heart! And I don't believe in letting them outside, because that is so incredibly dangerous too, much more than keeping them indoors, no matter where you live. At least this way, by putting these bright red stickers on a door and/or window where rescue personnel are likely to see them, telling them you have animal friends inside, what kind and how many, they can at least attempt to save their lives. It at least gives your pets a better chance for survival. And I don't know about you, but that gives me much more peace of mind. Thank you to whoever invented these!"
I am shopping on Amazon for another Petmate Walkabout leash after mine has finally died after seven years. The leash retracts easily and the trigger action and locking mechanism work perfectly.
"I love this game! Very addicting! My one beef is that the instructions seems a little vague. I wish it contained more examples of sets and non-sets. My cousin is a pro at this game, so I had to get him to teach me, because I wasn't sure I was doing it right. I like how you can play a solitaire version.This game really pushes you to think and to see set relationships in ways you probably haven't thought of before. Nice ""think outside the box"" game. It's great brain exercise!"
"All three of my children love this toy - especially the fact that it plays music. My youngest is a Diego fan, so this was right up his alley. The only thing I can't figure out, is why there is just one shoe included in the backpack. Oh, well :)I wouldn't say this toy is extremely educational - except for that fact that they are using their imagination. But, it is a great toy!"
"I bought this baby grand for my great niece for her first birthday. Once this present was opened and put together, which took about 1 minute, she did not stop playing with it, no matter what other present was opened. Word from my niece is that it has continued to be a hit at home. I highly recommend this toy."
It was worth ordering and waiting for. It's the best hair product for the unruly hair i have. It also reached me during the time alotted. I was pleased.
This item is the INFINITY DRYER / STRAIGHTENER BC173 Conair for hair.I have not had one disappointing issue with Amazon products. Unfortunately I ordered this item only three weeks before the second one. The first one burned up very quickly. I expect the second one to be better.
This is not a toy. It feels and weighs like a small white brick with thorns. If i had not thrown away the packaging I would have returned for a refund. Don't waste your money!
"My border collie will no longer eat a snack unless it is one of the Blue Dog Bakery snacks. Offered a regular snack, he sniffs and walks away. This is a very smart dog and he knows what he likes.Honestly, once you open the package, you will understand. It smells good. Have you ever opened a dog snack and thought it smelled like freshly baked cookies? These do. I never, ever, imagined that dog snacks could smell so good.Lucky they don't make cat snacks.The only flaw with this product is that they do go stale. I ordered a lot of a bunch of flavors on a Friday sale, I think, and the last box of six smelled a little stale to me. The dog did not mind at all!"
"2 cats; one just uses it, one chases it around all over the house grubbing like a little pig! What a hoot! Make sure to adjust the opening size to your kibble so it doesn't dump all over the floor."
"I bought this pack off of card rush, to try my luck and see if i could get older cards which are still pretty good.The package of cards i received came with almost the 100 cards.I only got 1 ultra rare and 1 super rare....Over all the cards are in pretty good condition,and i did not get a lot of repeats, only a few here and there.I only gonna end up adding anywhere from 5 - 15 cards to my deck,the other ones are pretty much useless for me, but the ones I did get,are well worth the money i paid for the full pack.If i ever want new cards, and have some spare money, I would definitely buy another pack to try my luck again....."
"Mickey loved this bed. But the reason for the low review is that the legs got ""tweaked"" and we could never get it to sit on all four legs once that happened. It's hard to describe but it ended up unstable so our dog stopped using it. It was like a wonky table that shifts every time you put weight on it."
"I've been using MD Forte products for 18 months, and have seen a noticeable difference in my skin. I've progressed from Level I to Level III. My dermatologist suggested I use these products containing glycolic acid--not for sun damaged skin--but for congested, combination skin. It works! I often times layer different MD Forte products"
This is a tiny Nylabone; but my 80 lbs. puppy likes it. He is over two feet tall; yet he still likes to play with this little Nylabone. He does not chew on it; but holds it in his mouth and moves it around. I'll probably get him a larger sized bone. This was a nylabone he found.
"I got this as a replacement for another bath tub toy holder. I LOVE this! Its perfct in size (we have a standard sandup shower). The opening is a perfect size (it gets smaller when its hanging so maybe thats what others a referring to when they say its too small). the suction cups are sturdy and strong, I have not had it fall down yet. I am purchasing another one for our other bathroom."
"loaded with lots of GD facts, but it's hard to play unless you are a real fan"
"I thought the coat would resemble a cheap poncho, but it ended up being quite solid and well-constructed. The material is surprisingly thick and heavy. It looks like it will be a great, long-lasting investment. Plus, it's cute, to boot."
The 8 and 9 month old that I nanny for really enjoy this toy and have for a few months. It is durable enough that my son has stood on it and it hasn't been damaged (don't recommend that though). The kids really like to squish it and squeeze it and are attracted to the bright colors.
"This product is available from many sources, that is several distributors sell it. These guys are top notch as to being timely. Arrived much sooner than expected."
"I am very fond of the scent of flowers, and roses especially. Quelques Rose smells just like a perfect rose! The scent is not overbearing, and lasts a long time. This has nothing to do with the quality of the fragrance, but the bottle is also very pretty, and fits nicely in me hand."
I love the whole PCA skin line! This is just another great product. I started with the Apres moisturizer and this and now converting to a whole PCA skin care regimen.
"I can't say enough about these toys! They are so nicely made and feel great in your hands. Small enough to carry around and big enough for little hands. Great quality, sturdy and superior look. Collectors are buying these up like hot cakes and ebay is living proof that people are willing to shell out the cash for these. Especially for the ones that are harder to find.People have written reviews on these that no stores carry them. They have been sold out because there has been a rush on these toys even before the movie release. Hopefully as time goes on and if they keep producing them they will be easier to come by. That's what I am hoping for. I don't have all the characters yet and would like at least one of each for my son, maybe even more for collecting.Good luck on your search!"
"When we adopted a pair of 5-6 lb cats, the first thing I was concerned with was how my fiance would deal with things if he could smell the litter box. He hates cat messes of ANY kind. The first few days we had them I used plastic bags, we all know how those go. Smelly, messy, and if you miss the whole in the bottom of one.....I purchased this at a national pet store chain because I needed to do something fast, and if there were issues I wanted to return it easily and try something else.I have had it for a month now, I am still on the first cartridge that came with it, once a week (or when the wheel gets hard to turn) I open the lid tie off the tube bag, carry it to the trash I am about to take out and seperate the handles. Done. No smell, no litter leaks, and no single plastic bags. I then just pull off enough bag to tie a knot and turn the wheel enough to make sure it's secure.I am using Tidy Cat litter, mainly because it seems to clump on urine the best, and they like to use the same area of the litter box to urinate. With this litter the way it clumps tends to take a lot of litter out at once, (I am ok with this, it allows a nice rate of litter turn over), I turn the wheel enough to seal off the litter clumps, which when it's almost empty is half a turn, and when it's almost full is less than a quarter turn. I don't smell the used litter, and no one else can either.All in all I am very happy with it, and would continue to purchase refills from Amazon.com as they are the cheapest ones available."
"I've had this 5-day feeder product for over 3 yrs and it has met my expectations. I've only had to change the batteries once (in May, 2010). The interface and directions were easy to follow in order to set the feeding times. I've set the timer to feed once in the morning while I would get ready for the day, and both morning and night if I'm going to be away from the house. The timer does allow you to pre-set a desired time for feeding your pet, such as more than twice a day. My cat took to it very quickly. The motor of the feeder is loud when it turns, but my cat doesn't mind it. It signals that food is ready! It's made out of durable plastic. He has tried to pry it open, but only left scratch marks near the clasp of the lid. The tray comes out easily for cleaning. I noticed there are no ""indicator"" or ""mark"" to show that the last slot of food would be empty in the next rotation, so I placed a sticker inside a slot to help me remember to fill the tray up with food again. IMHO, I didn't like the overall size of the feeder, but it's not that big of a deal. It's been reliable and I would recommend this to someone who is looking for an automated feeder.As of 06/07/2010, the feeder stopped working. I hope it's not because of the new brand name batteries. In any case, I would purchase this again."
"I have a liger zero, and its cute and all. But I think it is really a pain. Everything falls off al over the place (including its head...). But my friends liger walks, parts stay on....Just BUY IT! See for yourself! Go to media play, they usually have zoids at 75% off! Its only 8 dollars! If you dont have a Media play buy it here"
Optimus Prime rules the the transformer worls. His his trailer can transform automatically. It transforms into a base station when you transform his right arm on the truck. The trailer transforms into the legs when you transform him into the torso. Also if you have an RCA tv he might turn it off because of the infrared that makes the trailer transform

"A friend recommended this hand lotion to me a little over a year ago and I've never experienced such a difference in the texture and overall feel of my hands until I used Gardener's Hand Therapy. Its not just for gardeners either, my hands tend to get chapped and dry during the winter and i work in an office. this non-greasy lotion, makes your hands feel like silk. It makes a great gift too. With little convincing, my friends all use this lotion now."
"...it does the trick. Overall I think it's a decent product and value. I like that the entire 16 ft. of the leash is made of the nylon webbing. I was tricked on my last leash that only had abou 18 in. of nylon and which only lasted a couple of months. It's true that when fully extended the leash doesn't retract faster than my dog moves which on occasion leads to a tangle. I can see where this could pose a safety risk for your dog in certain situations (traffic, other dogs, etc.) but so far I've got no complaints. I've found that if you tilt the handle down, w/the opening toward the ground it seems to retract more quickly."
I never recieved my shipment from them. I tried contacting them several times and each time got a generic voice mail. I left messages requesting a call back and have not gotten one.
We registered for this product because it we thought it was so sweet. Once we actually put it in our new daughters crib and turned it on we found it to be adorable. Even our six year old loves the ceiling projected images and sweet nature sounds. Perfect crib toy!
"I think the Litllest Pet shop animals are the best toy because you can take them in the car and stuff like that with you.But when you are in th ecar after dark they don't have a light up screen Also they have this sticker diary where you can get different stickers for doing different things with your pets. You can also hook them up to other animals and then your animal and the other animal dance. It looks so cool. Trust me. And you can also feed, groom and play games with your pet. I love them."
I bought this for my 9 year old daughter and she loves it and it's easy to use and she also likes the bright colors.
I bought this product for my grandson and he loves it. He is just one year old and it is quite appropriate for his age level. He likes to match the animals and put them in the ark. It is a great tool to teach bible lessons too. I highly recommend this toy for young children
This is a great price on a great product. I give my Great Dane 1 tsp. daily and she looks great. It's a great size for the price! Love it.
"I searched and searched to find the perfect Battleship game to play with my 8-year old daughter. This version is not the cheapest, but it's far from the most expensive. It is the perfect version! Each player has their own board that they can hold in their lap. The boards are not connected like other versions. This is a great set to play for many years."
"This is the best moustache wax that I have ever used. I have a modified 3 musketeer type mustache, which is extremely long, needing a lot of hold under hot conditions. This is the wax that I recommend, and will someday bring to international competition."
Lots to do with this set and the dinosaurs are well built. It's a great alternative to the more expensive playsets and I feel it has comparable playability.
"I have very dry and flyaway hair without using an intense conditioner. Wella Kolestral has been around a long time and it has stood the test of time. I used it years ago and sort of forgot about it. I started using it again recently and it is such a great hair and scalp conditioner. A friend gave me a sample of Kerastase, a really expensive conditioner. Honestly, although it was good, it wasn't any better than Kolestral at a fraction of the price. Kolestral works best when you work it and warm it up with your hands and then massage it all over your scalp and then put some extra on the ends. Let it sit a few minutes (maybe while you shave your legs) and then rinse thoroughly. I use Kolestral very regularly along with a regular light conditioner. You can't beat it!"
I bought it for my friends dog he loves it. He sees the can and he starts running he cant wait for you to give him some! Even for picky eaters I recommend it. It works great with the kong.
My 9-month old loves to play with this. He can't put the shapes into the box yet but he is trying. Good quality construction.
My dog loves this toy! I used to use the Cube Dice toy that was similar but it was so hard and loud when my dog rolled it around. This toy is much nicer to the walls and the floors in my house. I put his daily kibble in here and he loves rolling the ball around to eat.
"THE SERVICE AND THE LOTION IN THE SAME LEVEL, THE BEST, I STRONGLY RECOMEND THIS PLACE TO BUY QUALITY ITEMSTHANK YOU"
"This is the 3rd one we have bought and it's a high quality useful folding dog pen. We buy the 24"" x 30"" for our 2 westies. I like the size of 1 pen closed for 1 dog.. very large area actually. We use 2 pens seperately 1 for each dog. When we go camping we connect the 2 pens together and use the large area for 2 dogs and 2 folding lawn chairs. Yes we sit inside with the dogs. We have it also surrounding the door to our camper so it's very easy to go inside. This time I have also purchased 2 of the quart stainless bowls that clip on to the pen. Our dogs tip over their water sometimes and grass isn't always level in campgrounds. The reason we bought the 1st pen was because one of the dogs had knee surgery and was required to be way less active, no running, no jumping up etc so it was easier being able to use the folding portable pen in the kitchen during the times I was preparing meals.. we used it in the evening to keep him in active in the living room... and used a regular crate at bedtime. When we go away for a few hours we put each dog in a pen in the kitchen. The pen can be made smaller very easily. I highly recommend them for home and travel. Another use is if I wish to sit out in the yard, I put 2 pens together and sit inside the pen with the dogs and read or knit. I have seen many campers use the pens and even leave their pets unattended, the pens do have stakes, but most camp grounds do not allow unattended pets outside. The pen is sturdy. I have also used the pens to go across an opening like the entry to the dining area in a single line zig zag fashion to keep the dogs in the kitchen dining area away from the grandkids running about the rest of the house. We have left one outdoors on our deck numerous times, even getting rained on, and the coating is really good as we've seen no rust, mind you I do try to remember to bring it in.. yes it got snow on it once, but has no ill effects. We don't really Leave them out, just forget to bring them in sometimes. I highly recommend the pen, be sure to buy one tall enough for your pet."
It is not as durable as I had hoped. My Great Dane had the ends torn up and firehose material punctured within 5 minutes.
"This is good quality and has the potential to be a fun toy for the right developmental stage. For my 3 year old daughter however, she seems to be kind of between what this toy is good for. She is well past number recognition (she can count to 20 frontwards and backward) but isn't quite ready for the addition/subtraction skills this toy can teach. So for her, she was bored with it pretty quickly. I will hold on to it though and take it out again in a few months to see if it gets better response then. The only quality issue with this toy is it has to be played on a hard surface - carpeted floor or foam pad will not work."
"In desperation I grabbed the promising-sounding hair ""spiking glue"" also from got2b to control my hair and hold it's style. That goop is astonishing in it's own way, but I haven't mastered how to effectively style with it. The spiking glue (yellow tube) starts pliable but rapidly dries and stiffens.This stuff (styling gel) starts watery and styles watery but once it's dry your hair is fixed in place. I retreated to this which is the weaker of the two products but ""weaker"" is misleading. The clumps and shapes you make at 9am are still bonded and firm at 9pm. I never had any hair product work this well. Every product promises extreme control, but unfortunately I have a bucket of barely-used products that didn't live up to their marketing description. Hair gels should have a ten point ""hold"" scale. This is a seven or an eight. (With a ten being"
"I got this toy for my daughter and myself, it is loud and the barking is alittle to much for me. plus the dog has trouble walking he keep falling over. but as for a toy like most my daughter got tried of it quickly."
"This is one of the best body lotions I've ever used. I've used many organic lotions, and many non-organic lotions. This one out classes them all. My boyfriend has extremely sensitve skin, which is itchy all day long; he can't even wear deodarant. I bought him Jojoba oil, which is excellent for so very many things. However, this did nothing to curb his itching either. I then gave him this lotion, and he's been itch free ever since. I love the scent, and love the moisturizing ability. I will use this as long as they make it; it's my favorite."
I am a Monopoly and toy collector plus I grew up with Big Bird and the gang. I own many monopoly editions but when I saw this version I was taken away with awe. This edition is plain and simply GOURGEOUS! I could go on and on forever telling you how beautiful and wonderful this Sesame Street Monopoly is but I will just go directly to the description. ENJOY!!!BOARD
"Update after 1-1/2 years of use. See added comments at the end.We almost bought the Littermaid Mega Elite at a local pet supply store, but decided to check out the Amazon.com reviews first. A good decision, as usual. Clearly, that model was to be avoided. But, based on most other reviews, the LM900 represented an improvement over previous versions and was worth a try.We have had the LM900 for two weeks now and it is working out quite well, so far. The unit seems well designed and solidly built. As mentioned in other reviews, the rake/motor mechanism appears to be strong. The larger of our two cats is a champion mound builder and during his first use he confirmed his credentials by creating a litter filler pile that was higher than the rake mechanism and scattered considerable material into the rake guide rails. Even before the unit went into action, our initial thought was that the device just wasn't intended for the likes of this cat. But, surprise, the rake plowed through the kitty Matterhorn with no balking at all. It properly scooped up all waste in its path and deposited it neatly into the waste receptacle before returning to its resting position to await the next challenge.Both cats have acclimated well to the unit. The older/larger one never hesitated. The smaller/younger one needed to wait a while to see whether it would devour the older cat. When it became clear that there would be no such luck, even the smaller cat complied with our intentions and everything has been going well since.It may be too early to provide a definitive review regarding longer-term performance and reliability but so far, so good. The LM900 is convenient, saves time and does reduce odors. The only negative comment (as noted by others) is that the waste receptacle/cover is tricky to remove and seal without some minor spillage.Added comments:It's been over 1-1/2 years since placing this item into operation. It's still working very well with 3 cats using it. A real testament as to its sturdy and reliable construction. The litter receptacle bin issue still exists. There is no way you're going to remove it without some spillage, so don't agonize over the effort. It is quite heavy when full. And, as long as you have it out, why not just dump its contents into a plastic bag for disposal and return the empty receptacle back to the unit? The bin doesn't wear out or degrade. This saves having to purchase replacement receptacle bins.Therck"
"I started wearing Drakkar Noir again after not wearing it for a long time. Now I remember why I started wearing Drakkar Noir in the first place. It is a great all around scent. When you look at your collection of fragrances, this is the one you can wear to work or when you go out. As you pick up the scent from yourself, you may not feel that it smells good but you do get compliments and smiles when you wear Drakkar Noir. Drakkar Noir is a sensual fragrance and works for any occasion. Although this is a spicy fragrance, it is not overpowering and will last throughout the day. You will not be disappointed with Drakkar Noir."
"My dogs absolutely love the ORKA puck, which is similar to this, so I wanted to try out a different shape. Maybe they don't chew on it as much as the puck, which must be more appealing in thickness or shape for their jaws and teeth. But they still enjoy chewing it and definitely enjoy tugging on the rope. The rubber material of the stick lasts a really long time. I have a couple of very determined chewers and they make this one last longer than just about any toy I've found. I recommend it, but try out the other shapes as well."
"I have used a lot of dog shedding brushes--teflon combs, shedding blades, and a cheaper version of this--and, as good as some of them are on my dog's coat, none of them work anything like the Furminator. The owner of the self-service dog wash let me borrow his one day, and I was hooked. I can brush my corgi once a week or so and pull out more hair than I thought possible. His coat looks much better, as does my house. It's very expensive (my only reason for the 4-star rating rather than 5), but for me, it was definitely worth it."
"Love Avalon products,felt clean and not itchy after use like many other products,very refreshing feeling."
"Our puppy gets excited and dribbles. These diapers work, however, our dog doesnt like them and it bothes her so much that she takes them off. The sizing on these are also a little small. We took measurements and ordered medium and they were too tight and then ordered the next size."
How to review something you never got????? No help from customer service and will not order again from them. Out the money and the toy. Bad business.
This is one of my all time favorites and I was not disappointed until I found there was no opening leg holster for the gun! I will not send him back....you can't make me. Thanks for a great product.
"*****This has been my daily moisturizer for several years. It makes my skin very soft, very healthy looking, and glowing. It makes me look radiant. I have given it as a gift to my sister and to other women, and they have all liked it as much as I have. No one has had any adverse reactions. You can notice a difference after just one use. When I've run out and used something else temporarily, I always can see the difference again once I start back up. It is as close as it gets to a miracle cream.I do not wear makeup, so Hope In A Jar is it. I am 49 years old and I think my skin looks incredible. The friends I have given it to also like to keep a natural look and prefer their skin without heavy creams, thick moisturizers and sunscreens, or makeup.The women I know who are fans of Hope In A Jar are like me. We're kind of lazy no-fuss ""one cream that does it all"" people; instead of one jar of something for one thing, and another for something else---eye creams, night time moisturizers, daytime moisturizers, etc.---we're the type that wants just one that can do the job and then be done with it. In other words, we don't have the patience to fuss with our looks a lot, or to spend money buying bunches of different creams to keep track of and remember to use.Unlike other reviewers, I love the smell, which is not perfumey, but definitely pleasantly distinctive. I use it around my eyes also, and have not had an allergic reaction. It seems, though, that these are the two biggest problems with Hope---the distinctive odor and allergic reactions among some people. I would suggest buying it the first time from somewhere you could return it if you don't care for it; although in my opinion, this would be unlikely, apparently it is possible. Philosophy now makes another version of Hope In A Jar for sensitive skin; if you know that your skin in tempermental, perhaps it would be better to also try this version. I have stuck with Hope In A Jar because it works so well for me.It seems expensive, but it is not because it lasts a long, long time. The two-ounce jar lasts me about six months. I use a toner and then Hope In A Jar and that's it. I'm done with my face in 30 seconds. Plus, it gives me a look that most women use makeup to get, so I think it's a bargain.****"
"Sobar Zinc Sun Protection is not just another sunscreen. It is a sun block. It blocks out harmful UV rays! It does not wash off. It lasts for hours. After skin cancer, I know how important it is to protect my delicate skin. I have tried numerous sun protectors and Sobar Zinc Protection Cream is the best on the market!"
"Unit arrived with the cord cut in half. Disappointed, but didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it, so spliced the cord back together. Kitties love it. One of my kitties loved to tip her water bowl over, so this way she can play all she wants but can't knock it over.I break it down and wash it every week, it gets slimy otherwise. It is nice that it can be washed thoroughly. Have put the base and tower in the top of the dishwasher and they clean up fine. Definitely worth the money."
I bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts and was very disappointed. When you play the game you feel like you should be quiet for the 30 seconds the other players use to study the card. It's like taking a test in front of your friends and family. It's excrutiatingly BORING.
"Seriously - Stop wasting your time on BS products. If you've landed on this page, you are fortunate. This product outperforms every single product and DOCTOR I have talked to about my skin. I didn't develop acne until the ripe age of 26. YES, 26!!!! WTH, right?? At least I only had to deal with one awkward phase of life at a time, not all at the age of 16 -- so anyways, I tried everything until I noticed my sister's skin had cleared entirely after using this product. She doesn't even need to wear face make up anymore. Yes, it cleared up that much. I decided to give it a whirl ... I mean why not, I had already spent so much money on other products, what's another 25 bucks right? Hands down, the best $25 dollars I ever spent. I got my glow back, my self esteem, my energy... all for less than an hour's work. I couldn't be more happy with my skin, it's even better now than it was before I started breaking out. I barely wear any face make up, just some powder and blush and it looks so smooth.The only qualm I have is the process. You have to be dedicated and go in with the mindset that this is a 3 stop process and it does take time. It's not just washing your face and slick on some moisturizer. It is really CLEANING your face with the face wash, using the toner. Letting that dry entirely and then either putting on the moisturizer in the morning, or the overnight cream at night. This should be put on very generously. I've noticed the more I put on, the clearer my skin is in the morning. This also has to dry before hitting the pillow to avoid a mess.Also, as another reviewer wrote, this is not for you if you have the rare breakout. The medicines are potent and it will dry out your skin the first week you use it. Keep lip balm handy as it dries out your lips too. This only lasts about the first week or two though and after that you'll be glad you stuck to it. Also, keep out of your eyes -- don't even get close because it will irritate your undereyes as well. I speak from experience :/"
"I choseSmart Snacks Gingerbread House Sorterinstead because it's more versatile. It has a Christmas motif, it's prettier and may still be of some interest to an older child when they are playing cooking."
I loved and enjoyed the monopoly game as a kid but it pigues my imagination how I lost the track of the game.I just bought a new one but I can not play it and I miss the game terriblly. Is there a way out? I need an urgent help so that I can start enjoying my lovely game.I wouldn't mind if it could be played on line.Stellamaris
"We bought this for my son who is 4 and never had a remote truck before. We weren't sure if he would be too old for this one, but we were wrong. Its perfect for his age! Easy to control and very durable. Even my 1 year likes to push buttons and drag it around. It seems to hold up to the banging around. Batteries die quickly it only uses 'AA"" but works out in the dirt too."
"I've been giving this product to my dog for about 1 month now along with the recommended other supplement Arthisoothe. I have to say, I really don't see any improvement in him. He is a 3 year old Collie that had an injury at 15 months that has caused him some early problems with arthritis. I was hoping he would do better on this stuff, but so far, he is not. Since I bought a big bottle of it, I will continue with it until they are gone just to see if there is improvement after some more time has gone by."
"I never write reviews, but holy cow did this product work on my cat. So the product is really just some wire wound around some cardboard ends. But the wire is just the right thickness and the cardboard draws just enough attention that my normally lazy adult cat (who never plays with toys) was completely entranced by it - even more so than with a laser pointer because this toy she could occasionally grab and swipe at. Again, this isn't anything fancy. But the wire makes the end move erratically so just a little bit of movement with your hand can cause very random movements at the end (think moth fluttering crazily about). Very minimal effort on your part, and a very happy kitty. Excellent product."
The product is helping my cat with her anemia. Fast and efficient service from the vendor. I recommend for anyone who needs a supplement for their pet.
"My sister got Trivia for Dummies as a gift while she lived with me and when she moved out, we kept it. When she finally asked for the game back I went to Amazon to find my own copy of the game. We have had so much fun playing it. The last foursome was age 19, 29, 40, and 66, and we had a ball. It's great fun for everyone. And although we've played it many times, we still haven't used all the cards. Thank you Amazon for helping us find our game."
"I wish hasbro would them as original as possible, and the price is a little high too."
"Great power, heat & good direction with the 3 different attachments...Great for all types of hair especially harder to manage & you need a good blow dryer to get it straight. Don't have to flat iron hair as much with this!"
"FABULOUS scent! with all my year round allergies i have a VERY hard time handling any kind of perfume/scented body lotions, but this soft feminine scent is just right all year round. i do have other perfumes i like but i always go back to ""tracy"". thanks =3"
"I purchased the 2oz one and have to say that I am very pleased with the it. I received it a couple of days after I ordered it, and it was wrapped with the plastic wrap. I would say it is authentic, haven't opened it though, because it was for a gift. Thank you for the fast delivery."
"My daycare children love this. It is easy enough thatthe very smart almost 5 year old I watch can playthis on her own. The 2 and 3 year olds have playedthis and with just a little help understand it andlove to play it. If you are looking for somethingyounger kids can play this is a winner.The only issues with little ones playing, is they don'tunderstand that you have to shout out ""bunny"" or ""tree""before someone else. So we just help them along withthis rule...giving each child a chance to win a tile...Also I would recommend that an adult or older responsibleperson help with this game...the tiles are a bit hardto put back and if little ones are trying by themselvesthey won't have success with this part of the game andif they are rough on things they could break it...SOHAVE AN OLDER RESPONSIBLE PERSON HELP.Overall, I think it is great and I am glad I purchased this forthem!"
"This volumizer is even better than the Big Sexy Hair Root Pump. I live in the Southeast, one of the most humid areas in the US, you literally feel like there's a film over you when you step outside! This hair spray holds up quite well against the humidity, and smells really good too. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a lift."
"I love this shampoo, it leaves my hair feeling clean and soft. There are no harsh chemicals, so I feel comfortable using it on my highlighted hair."
I have naturally curly hair that is extremely dry. I have used all types of shampoo.This is the first shampoo that doesn't dry my hair or scalp.Love this shampoo
"My son has had this toy since he was 1 and he is now 3. He used to play with it constantly until I got tired of cleaning out the misc items stuffed in it. The balls have disappeared but that didn't stop him from stuffing little people or cars in it to go down the ""slide"". Great music as well!"
"I purchase this product for a little girl's birthday. She has a 9 year old Golden Retriever, named Phoebe. This little girl LOVED her Webkinz Golden Retriever. Nice product and FASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSST ship!"
"I have afro kinky African-American hair. I assure you that this is THE single best oil I've ever tried. I don't know what it is about it but it is completely different than any other oil out there. I have regular problems with dry frazzled hair. Most times I wind up with dry crispy hair with fruity smelling oil dripping down coating my neck and forhead. Yick. Somebody told me about Botanic oil so I went to check it out. Due to the pricey tag, I cheated and sampled some in the store while no one was looking. Right away my hair was softer on contact with just a little drop. I bought it immediately. NO oil can do what this one does. With my worst hair I mix it in with my favorite conditioner, heat the mixture in the microwave for a few seconds and then apply to my hair under a plastic cap. My hair is as soft as a whisper after.Best about this oil, you can use it all over. Good for skin and nails too and it has no fragrance at all. It won't clash with any other product/fragrance you love and it is completly safe for sensitive skin and noses. It might be tricky trying to find this product soon. They are going to change the label and begin selling Botanic Oil under their AloXXi line, and you will only be able to buy it in bulk 33.8 fl. oz. sizes. Because everything I ever loved has gotten discontinued I'm going to buy two of these but unless you plan on drinking it, it should last you a long time.I hear ApHogee makes an Essential Fatty Acids oil that gives this one a run for it's money at a much friendlier price but I've never tried it personally. Good luck finding either of them though. They are hard to track down."
My 5 years old nephew love this game. 2D games difficulty level is appropriate for him. Advanced 3D games are quite challenging and even I find them interesting.
"Spent $80 on this expensive strong cologne, girlfriend hated it. Now its just a decoration. Make sure your women like it first otherwise you are burning your money."
I bought this perfume for my mother for her birthday. It is her favorite perfume. What I loved most was the price for such a nice size bottle! She is very pleased and so am I! The shipping was fast too!!! :)
"Works beautifully! Gets hot enough to really control course or stubborn hair on the first try. No going over and over the same piece of hair! Hair doesn't get damaged, easy tool to hold, and contrary to some of the other reviewer, I have no trouble with hair getting caught in the plates. My first one was still working beautifully after a year, so I gave it to my daughter (who was constantly borrowing it) and bought another one for myself."
"This cologne is one of my favorites. I brought this cologne after reading other reviews. I took a chance. I must say, this cologne has a unique smell. I get compliments from people all the time. I really enjoy wearing this cologne. It is especially good for casual evening wear when your going out for a night out. Women will definitely notice you."
"We have another toy by this company (Multipet) that our girl dog loves and is the only plush toy they haven't destroyed within 15 minutes. So I wanted another one for the boy dog. I ordered this one because of its large size and because it has very few ""pieces"" that could be ripped off. The dog loves it and it's lasted over a month, even though it's pretty disgusting from the slobber. He's finally ripped a hole in it, but I just removed the stuffing and he still plays with it. I've tried toys by other brands, but our dogs only seem to enjoy the ones from Multipet and they tend to last the longest."
"I bought my husband, an avid chess player, Excaliber for Christmas. Overall it has been more than challenging for him on even the lowest settings. There are a few glitches off and on probably because of the sensitivity of the machine, and he has had to restart it more than once. It sometimes reads error although the space it is called on has not been in play or has no chess piece for awhile. My husband does not have good eyesight and we find the digital display quite small for older folks. There are several ways according to the enclosed pamphlet to reset, takeback moves, etc but once it says error it usually pretty much sticks to it until you restart the game. We would much prefer lit LED squares to show the moves rather than the grid method, but he still enjoys his Excaliber because of the challenge and regulation size."
"Pros:* Very, very cheap* May be healthier than clay-based* Not a bad odorCons:* Clumps are VERY difficult to remove from the sides and bottom of box* I found white dust everywhere within 5 feet of the box, including on top of the refrigerator, and on pots and pans above the refrigeratorI started using this to get away from the possibly harmful clay dust. I was pleased with how cheap it is. That helped me overlook the fact that it was a workout to get the clumps out. But after a year of use, I could no longer overlook the extremely fine white dust that was accumulating on my peanut butter jars on top of the refrigerator. I am now using World's Best, which is more expensive, but worrth it. Buy it from Amazon or PetfoodDirect."
The were fun to watch when they first arrived. After a while they became boring. I think they are better as an adult toy or desk top decor
"The product is one that does what it says it will do. Make sure to wait till two or three days after a bath and before a bath. Fleas will get on the dog, but they will be killed when they bite and not prduce eggs."
"At first I thought this litter box was great, but then I realized it wasn't all that great when I had to take it apart and clean the whole thing. My cat sprays on the inside of the box and the rolling action of the self cleaning feature created a coat of clumping litter on the inside of the box as well as odor. So while I thought I was getting off easy with the cleaning- I actually was creating a HUGE cleaning headache for myself...the grill inside was a nightmare to clean! (Even if your cat does not spray remember not to roll the box until after the clumping litter has hardened otherwise you will get sticky litter stuck to the grill.) I went back to a regular litterbox,litter made from wheat and daily litterbox patrol. I'd say I don't do anymore work now than I did when I used this self cleaning litter box. When looking at reviews for this product make sure it is from someone who has used it for at least a month- because I know the first few weeks you'll think you found a gold mine and then you realize cleaning a litterbox still requires work!"
"I ordered this along with some other toys for my eight 5 week old puppies I am raising. I thought that they would tug on the handles the way they play tug'o'war with everything else. However, so far I have not seen them do much more than chew on it or carry it around. Maybe in a few weeks they will use it but so far it is just sitting in their puppy den collecting dust."
"i was trying to experiment with different brands and love honeysuckle. but when i got this product , it smells like shampoo or soap. i was very disappointed. i asked a few other people and they said the same thing. nothing flowery about this scent at all. do not waste your money"
"Remember watching Concentration on tv, you sit there trying to guess what the puzzle would be. You watch as the contestants win great prizes and wished you had the chance to play - well now you do!Endless Games has given you the home version of the television game we all loved. Played just like on tv, you try to match the prizes and reveal the board, once you have enough clues you try to solve the puzzle.You are given 60 rebus cards to play with. Their needs to be an two players or two teams, the odd player out becomes the Emcee for that game and he sets up the game board for play.Hopefully, Endless Games will create additional prize set and rebus cards. The game is fun for young and old and at a price everyone will love. For this holiday season, make this game one for Santa's list."
THIS ITEM IS VERY HANDY FOR PLAYING DOMINOES! MY FATHER USES THEM ALL THE TIME!
My three year old got this for his birthday and he just loves it and it is amazing how well he uses it. The only problem I had was that setup took a few minutes. My suggestion is to set up the toy before the child receives it.
"I usually go into these reviews with at least a partial sense that I am subject to committing user error. In this case, I can't lay fault completely to the product, but I will say that the biggest problems were not caused by me.First, the product does not anywhere say that someone with light skin couldn't not use it. As it is the medium and not the dark, I thought I was safe. Wrong.Next, it doesn't have any suggestions for HOW to apply the color. That would be helpful. I read around that I should use circular motions, and when I got to it, I forgot and didn't at all. That was definitely my fault. Straight up and down motions cause streaks. And boy did I get streaks.The worst part is that I am seriously orange. And the box says you will see results within ""less than an hour."" No way. When I went to bed (read"
"I have hardwood floors thru out my house. When the cat pees I wipe it up and then use clorox wipes on the floot. The directions say not to disinfect the spot, but I'm afraid it will smell if I don't. After I spray the hardwood floor I blot the product a little. When it dries you can see where I sprayed the product. It has helped me, but we haven't eliminated the problem.Fay"
"The situation is that I have a parrot who has been diagnosed with terminal metastized cancer. He was losing weight - At one point as much as 20 grams a day, despite being given a standard diet with a bunch of treats, all he could eat. His digestive system had been affected by the cancer - and he needed something that could be digested more easily.Get a lot of 2-3 ounce semi-disposable containers. You will use one of these per serving. Try to get the microwavable ones.Mix the folllowing"

"After trying veterinary shampoos and K-9 Revolution, my dog was still itching and whining in misery from Cheyletiella mange. Granted, this is not a burrowing mange mite like the sarcopic mange the bottle targets, but it was still not reacting to anything else I tried. I was at a point where I would try anything to make him feel better.This stuff smells horrible (your dog and probably your house will smell like turpentine after use) but after dousing my Corgi with it and leaving it in a couple days before bathing him, he is itch-free!. Also be wary of where your dog sleeps etc. while the treatment is on him/her. I have a nice oily yellowish spot on my comforter. The treatment is an nasty orange color, but since my dog is orange, I can't really say if it would stain a light colored dog. I don't know.Anyhow - If any of my pets come in contact with mange in the future, I'll spend the money on this stuff before I fork out left and right for more expensive stuff from the veterinarian."
My son loves his bed. He plays off & on all day in it. Very easy to put together. It was definitely worth the money!
I love the fragrance called Eau D Eden by Cacharel. I bought it in Paris when travelling there. So I thought I would try the internet to buy some more.(It is not available in Australia). I was sent a fragrance called Eden even though I ordered Eau D Eden and that was on the order form. When I tried to get the correct item all the company would do was to refund the difference in price. So I am left with a product that I do not like and will never use.
"We use a lot of Nature's Gate products and have for years so when I saw they had an acne treatment system I was really looking forward to trying it.Two of my sons have had some acne problems for the past few years and I still get the occasional pimple myself so we were all looking forward to trying this out.The kit comes with three products, a corrective cleanser, a calming toner and a controlling lotion.The cleanser contains both Salicylic Acid (a commonly used acne treatment) and Tea Tree Oil. Both are good for clearing your acne, and they contain certified organic botanicals.The calming toner, as well as some of the other products, have a new product called Oligopeptide-10. Nature's Gate is the first company to include it. It's a fusion of 15 naturally occurring amino acids combine with Salicylic Acid. It's works synergistically to eliminate bacteria and fight your acne.The kit comes with a 4oz bottle of the corrective cleanser, a 4 oz bottle of the calming toner and a 2oz bottle of the controlling lotion.One thing I really liked was how nice it smelled. Each products had a different but pleasant smell.It works, we're seeing an improvement in our skin already. I'd recommend this, it's natural and the price is right too."
This is fun for the whole family and a great way to get kids to concentrate!
I have a 15 year old mini schnauzer with Cushings that caused wetting accidents and less bladder control. We tried Proin...scary drug...she ended up in the animal emergency clinic with hives from Proin...then I did research on Proin...it was taken off the market for humans due to how dangerous it is. Bladder Strength has helped but has not totally arrested the problem but has made it bearable to live with. Proin totally stopped the problem but could have killed my dog.
"One of the worst designs imaginable. Won't scoop even a clean litter box, much less any clumps from cat waste. If you want a self-cleaning litter box that isn't self-cleaning, go ahead and buy this one. It's also very noisy. After the forth try before it gives up on scooping the litter box, I grow very angry because the noise goes on forever and you know you will also have to manually scoop the automatic litter box. I hate being taken in by false advertising. The FTC should go after this company!"
"I don't know why you would buy anything else unless you have a concrete patio or a putting green your dog poops on you need this to get poop off your lawn after 9 years my old one broke so I purchased a new one, it looks the same as the old so I am now happy to walk in my back yard it works well on any size from 14 lb dog to 125 lb"
I have been using this product for a while. It is not greasy and my skin feels smooth. I'm not sure about the wrinkle reducing effect but it moisturizes and leaves skin feeling silky. It's too bad that the cream does not have the SPF 15 and the ingredient is somewhat different??? I have used the Nivea cleansing products as well and they are all pretty good so far. I recommend these skin proudcts since they are nice and inexpensive.
I really like the furminator for the cat. I wish it had the button to eject the fur though. You can still pull it off it just would have been easier with the button. I didn't realize this one didn't have it. Cat doesn't seem to mind being combed. It just pulls out the loose hair. It doesn't pull out the ones that are still attached. So now I have a lot less fur on the furniture and on me. It really helps.Amazon was very quick with the delivery. It arrived earlier than they predicted. Nice.
"My son uses and likes this product, but we could not find it locally anymore."
This is a great family game. My kids ages 4 and 7 years can easily play it together. This game gets 2 thumbs up!
My Shih Tzu has a severe flea allergy. This shampoo soothes her and lets her rest from all of the scratching and itching. I am pleased with this shampoo.
My dogs love Peanut Butter so I thought this would be fun. There is no hint of peanut butter at all....just a regular tennis ball that is a bit heavier.
"because my cat goes crazy for them, in all their flavors! It's gotten to the point where he will jump high and low to get to the bag and paw at them to try and open it himself! He truly loves them and there are no down sides that we have with many other treats!"
love this fragrance for my boyfriend. it's his favorite too. this is a great price for this huge bottle!!!!
"Purchased Leapster and case for Christmas 2005. Zipper broke last night (not even 3 months later). We have always been careful with the Leapster and case so it's not being tossed around. I saw one review that indicated it's a problem if you have a cartridge inserted when placing in the case. Maybe that's the problem but it didn't seem like that would matter. Case needs to be a tad bit bigger so there is not so much stress on the case. I'm going to give another one a try hoping it will be better. I really can't imagine not having a case to keep all the games, etc. together."
Do you need to use your phone but can't pry it from your little ones hands...try getting this great Fisher Price phone. It is very durable and will bring smiles to your childrens faces. It makes minimual noise. They pretend for hours to call all their friends and relatives..even some I have never heard of...The little ones will love the moving eyes and as they get older they will use it when they play house. It is one of those ageless toys...(except your teenager might think otherwise) Your child can also pull this toy with the string that is provided. It may not have the NEW up-to-date look but it teaches kids to use their imagination and it saves you on buying Batteries..Yeah! Add this one to your list to buy~you will never regret it!
"My girlfriend loves the stuff. I think it's pretty okay. Since you can't find it in stores anymore, this is the best place to get it. It's the real stuff."
"This is the best smelling men's cologne, but unfortunately it has become hard to find unless you go to a Tommy Bahama store. I'm so glad Amazon carries it!"
"This is the only toy that i have found besides the KONG that stands up to my heavy chewers!! I have a Pit, a Lab/Pit mix, and a Coonhound/Ridgeback mix. This toy is fabulous! I bought two!they chew it alone.they chew it together.they tugawar w/eachother and w/my boys.they fetch (it bounces!)This toy passes the test!!Thanks!"
"I purchased this product for my husband who has had dandruff for as long as I've known him. I noticed more often that he had been sracthing his head, and when he did, the dandruff was really bad. So I started reseaching dandruff shampoos. He is pretty picky, and only wanted to use Nexxus, so when I found this product, I bought it. I was hesitant at first to spend $20 on shampoo, but I bought it anyway. When we got it, he used it once and I saw a dramatic diffrence. It wasn't all gone, but instead of the huge flakes, there were only little flakes. Then, when he shampoo'd a few days later for the 2nd time with this product, it was totally gone! I was so happy! I never thought a product could work as well as this one did!"
Great price on this Cologne my husband loves. Amazon it the only way to shop for the best price and convenience.
"This really seems like a magical cure, something Bones from Star Trek would use. One of my cats seems particularly susceptible to fleas, and after he gets healed he always runs into problems again a few months later. He may be allergic. The scabs on his neck from his scratching get really out of control.But give him frontline and within 4 hours he isn't scratching anymore and within a week he doesn't have a scab anywhere on his body. It's expensive but more than worth it."
These are really easy to use and not messy. Just be careful to cover the area fully because you do get a nice dark at home tan with this product and if you miss a spot it will be noticeable!
"The only scent I wear. This product is long lasting, a little goes a long way and the scent lasts and lasts. I love it."
"This is the best, I am trying to let my bangs grow out and I have had the hardest time keeping them out of my face. I am wearing glasses so I thought a headband would not be for me since the space behind my ears is already taken - so this product is perfect for women wearing glasses. All the headbands I have owned have been worthless, not these, they are so comfortable, you forget that they are even there. Having lots of curly hair a lot of headbands were not strong enough to stay put, these do not move at all, my hair looks great all day long - I love this product."
"I've always wanted to learn how to play chess and teach my kids how to play. My kids were fascinated by the size of the pieces. My only criticism is that it should have come with a case. Once you open the box, you then have to figure out storage options. But, it's a great twist on a classic game! Well worth the money!"
This is the 3rd or 4th of this toy that we have purchased for our 120 lb. chocolate lab. He loves it even though he's determined to extract the squeaker out of every one he gets. We've performed cosmetic surgery to make each one last as long as possible. It's always his favorite toy. The only way to make them last longer would be to make them out of chain maille!JUMBO Grunting Hedgehog (Brown)
"This product is totally effective. I use it when I'm out of the house to prevent my dogs from eating our leather sofas. So far, so good."
Hands down the best diaper rash cream in existence.Better than that stupid 'Boudreauxs Butt Paste' or whatever.
"I received a used and dirty brush. I emailed the company who advised they would send me a package for returning that item, and I have not received that yet either!"
"So to start, you CAN play this like the orignal Risk so it is like the orignal in this way. As far as playing it the new way it was very complicated and me and my 11 year old spent 1hr just looking over the directions. It will be fun once you figure out the directions (which we have not done yet :( )."
"I bought this product for my English Bulldog puppy -4 months- and I think this feeder is an excellent idea when you have to go out and your puppy need to be feeded several times during the day. Now my puppy recognized inmediately the sound when it is... eat time.The feeder is very easy to set, so easy to clean and the plastic seems to be durable, mostly when my dog stands over it.I do really recommended this product for a small or medium dog, because the dishes - 1 cup and a half - probably would be smaller for a big dog.."
"It is a good butter for the skin. For the hair, it's best to mix it with other oils. I have tried using it after wetting my hair and using a moisturizer. My hair doesn't like heavy butters and oils. I had to learn the hard way. I had a hard time washing it out of my hair. It's great for the skin though."
My dogs play constabtly with plastic and rubber type treat toys. I have never has one break before. This bottle on a rope smashed in two places the first day I gave it to my dogs leaving jagged edges at the neck of the bottle and the bottom screw on lid. It was not made to withstand shaking and banging the toy on the ground which dogs generally do with toys on ropes.
"My wife and I have owned the Cat Genie for about 4 weeks now and love it. When I first read about it, I thought it was a joke and couldn't stop laughing at the cat toilet that someone had 'invented', but the thing really works well. We have 2 cats (sisters, 9 months old) and they seem to do very well with it. One of the cats started using it immediately and preferred it over the old litter box. The other took about a week to train (suggested time frame from the company). In the training process there were a couple of accidents, but they were all in our laundry room. Ironically, one of the accidents was on the instruction manual for the Cat Genie! After this initial phase-in of 1-1.5 weeks, we haven't had any problems. We set the device to clean itself 2 times per day when our cats are inactive (4am and 4pm) and that works well. We have it hooked up to our laundry drain pipe for waste disposal and that works well (no clogs so far, although I have heard that others have problems if the waste isn't removed often enough, i.e. less than once per day)We both love the device and think that it is worth the price that is being charged and the fact that we don't have to scoop and dispose of normal cat litter. We had been thinking about getting one of the other 'automatic' litter boxes, but you still have to empty these devices on a weekly basis and I've heard that they don't work well.As with any consumer product there are faults, but I feel the gains much out way the faults.Pros:-The first fully automatic litter box!-only $ 330 (not much for what it does)-relatively reliable (could take vacation without too much worry for litter box, although I would want someone to check-in once or twice)-The box is always clean for the cats (they seem to prefer this now that they are used to it)-The plastic litter pellets are clean and are easy to sweep upCons:-somewhat loud (not as loud as a washing machine though)-litter pieces tend to scatter out (we are buying a special hood that just came out)-smell of cleaning solution is strong (it is a pleasant smell, but it smells like cleaning solution in a large part of the house for an hour after a cleaning cycle)-$330. Thats a lot of money for anything, but especially on a litter box-somewhat large (the bowl is larger than a standard toilet bowl, but is about the same size as our previous litter box, so it makes sense I guess)Also, some people complain about the cost of the consumables (litter pellets, and cleaning solution), but I think I agree with the company in that the consumables cost about the same price as the normal litter, if not a bit cheaper.Improvements I would like to see for V2.0:-more flexible cleaning times (for 2 times per day it cleans 12 hrs apart, 3 cycles is 8 hrs apart, and so on). I would like it to clean at 4am and at 1pm but this isn't possible now.-It would be nice if it came with a hood, but that is an add-on now-deeper litter depth (right now it can only allow for 3-4cm of litter depth and its seems like our cats would like to bury their waste a little deeper-quieter cleaning cycles (but a more flexible cleaning time cycle would make this point moot if we were gone for the day or asleep)-smaller total size, although the litter bowl size is about perfectSo, if you have the initial $330 for a litter box and want it to be automatic, then this thin is awesome and I highly recommend it. However, if your mission is to save money, then it doesn't make sense as a purchase.Hope this was helpful!"
I read the reviews before I bought this game for my 2 year old. Keeps my two year old totally engaged and it is fun to play with her. The only downside is that the cards are regular game cards so a child could crumple them easily if you are not careful (which is too much to expect from 2 year olds). Wish it was a wee bit more durable. I got this game on sale so I think it is money well spent!
"One of my favorite colognes, but for my wife, it's her absolute favorite. Drives her crazy. It's a fragrance that isn't overpowering, yet can stand out within a crowd. Amazon's price is a little more than half off of what Macy will charge her."
"My dog, Shiloh, has been diagnosed with Addison's diease. We had to constantly encourage her and bribe her to drink more water. Since the first time I set the unit on the floor she has increased her drinking to at least a gallon a day (she's a big dog).The unit is easy to clean although because of arthritis I have to have help removing the motor for cleaning it is still easier than her old water bowls and the fight to get her to drink."
"Good keyboard and mouse, works very much like a real laptop. Most of the games I've reviewed with my daugher are good, fun and educational. A few are a bit confusing. The only complaint I have is that the screen is very small."
"This prodcut is fabulous. Even my big old cranky cat enjoys being brushed with the Zoom Groom. I liked it so well, I bought another for a different part of our house and two for another family member, It does an excellent job on all hair lengths."
"I own this product and have used it 3 times so far. I hate coloring my hair but refuse to pay to have my hair colored at the salon. This Colorjoi is the only product on the market (AFAIK) that helps with home hair coloring.This product is not complicated to use. Just load the chamber with your mixed hair color then press the button to advance the hair color out of the prongs. Brush your hair with the device (like using a bulky hair brush) while holding the button down and the hair color is distributed to the root and along the length of your hair.The Colorjoi works quite well and is much easier than sectioning hair into tiny lines and squeezing hair color along each part then combing through. I would recommend doing the back of the head separately first (the instructions only say to do that for long hair, but I think it would work best for all lengths), to make sure that the hair underneath is completely covered with hair color. I have shoulder-length hair and section the back into two sections (top of back and bottom of back) then section the front/top into right and left sides. When using the Colorjoi, I am careful to cover all areas of my head and I use a comb after putting on the color to better distribute to the ends of my hair.The Colorjoi comes with two types of color diffusers, one for overall coloring and one for root coloring. I have only used the overall coloring one.It holds one standard size box of haircolor and needs to be re-loaded if you use additional hair color (i usually use 1 1/2 boxes). It is not difficult to re-load, though - just unscrew the color diffuser, press down on the bottom and add more hair color.It is somewhat difficult to clean, although the hair color chamber does easily remove from the base/handle. Even though it says to throw out the color diffuser (what the previous review was complaining about), I just wash it and reuse. It is made of heavy plastic, too heavy to seem ""disposable"". I put the diffuser directly under the faucet to wash out the prongs and tap it on the bottom of the sink to get the haircolor out. Just hold up to a light to see if the prongs are clean.I did not find the written instructions long or confusing. It also comes with DVD instructions to watch a video on how it is used.I do like this appliance. It makes haircoloring so much easier for me. I used to have a very hard time coloring my hair by myself, especially the back of my head. The Colorjoi makes it much easier and I would recommend it. It is not a holy grail product, but it is a good value when compared to salon coloring and also saves time."
"I ordered this because at 40 I started to get dark circles under my eyes. They are not puffy, but rather more gaunt looking. Looked like I was closer to 50, especially when tired.I ordered this and RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream at the same time. I got the Neutrogena because it had positive reviews and was inexpensive; I got the RoC because it was a brand that I heard a lot of people recommend for dark circles under the eye.I put the Neutrogena on at night and the next morning when I woke up I had forgotten about getting these products - first time I've bought anything other than Irish Spring and toothpaste. When I looked in the mirror I immediately noticed a difference - I checked to see how long I had slept because I figured it was due to a good nights sleep. Nope, 1 hour less than normal.That doesn't mean they were completely gone, just noticeably lighter. I used the Neutrogena for 2 more days until I read the directions. There's a warning that it makes you more sensitive to sunlight. I live in TX and burn walking across a parking lot so I decided to put this away for when it's cloudy & switched to the RoC. I put it on at night and in the morning and it seems to keep making improvements...enough that I don't regret the purchase."
"We purchased this red fire engine for our 2 1/2 year old son who loves vehicles. It's the fourth Playmobil vehicle we have purchased for him. At first he wouldn't touch the candy in his Easter basket (""I driving fire truck!"")The firefighter is one piece, hinged in the middle so he can either sit or stand. His head rotates 180*. He is the same size as the mature Playmobil figures, so the toddler collection can still be used as he grows into the Playmobil sets with little pieces. Technically, the firefighter could fit through a toilet paper tube. The packaging says this is intended for ages 18 months and older. The ladder can tilt up or level; it can also swivel 180*. The little sign can be put away on the truck under the ladder. My only disappointment with this vehicle is that the ladder has come off the truck a few times. It is easy to snap back on. The best sign of quality on this vehicle? It comes with a trailer hitch! Our son loves putting the trailer from the safari vehicle onto the back of his fire truck.Our family looks forward to new additions to the expanding Playmobil 1 2 3 line!"
"While in total agreement with all the positive reviews of PI COLOGNE, and a long time user of PI COLOGNE, let me offer one word of warning to those who purchase the product online.There are many, many online sources for buying fragrances. In a few instances, we have found the lowest prices to be found at web sites that have sold us out of date merchandise. Both my wife and I have been disappointed to make a fragance purchase online, but when used, did not have long lasting impact hoped for when bought.Our solution?Call the web site directly, and ask when the product was produced, when it arrived at their warehouse, and how long it has been in their inventory. When we did this, we got FRESH PRODUCT. When PI COLOGNE is fresh, the fragrance lasts all day long with a subtle and pleasing aroma. A great product..........we agree with the review that called PI one of the five greatest of all time."
"This product is of very poor quality. The foam began to come apart within a couple months of use. The cover is easy to remove for washing, but extremely difficult to put back on the poor quality foam. The bed now looks like it has been use for years versus months. It is not worth the money."
"When I first got my cats....I tried using Hartz treatment to prevent fleas. Within a week, I was seeing fleas all over them. I then tried using the ""bulk"" package of Frontline (the kind that comes in a syringe-like tube)....the fleas were disappearing, but I still saw some on my cats. Finally....I broke down and bought the full dose of Frontline for my cats. They have been flea free since! Frontline (in the full doses) is really worth the money! And it's much cheaper on Amazon than any other website or vet clinic. Thanks!"
"I got this for my 3 year old grandchild and she plays with the figures all the time while singing the theme song. She loves to put them to sleep in their bed and clean up with Noo-noo!Colorful characters are just the right size for them to hold. They look just like the TV characters which they love. Easy to use and very durable so far, and it has been 2 years!"
"Got a little bald spot on the top of my head (obviously the start of MPB), so I started using Toppik. It does a great job of covering the spot. Im going to start propecia soon as well."
"My daughter rec'd this toy when she was just over one years old. she has issues with using the mic, you must hold the button down to make the mic work. i also wished that the volume was able to be adjusted."
"I have been searching for the perfect facewash my entire life. I have always had problematic semi-oily skin. I am 27 and have found that my skin is a little less oily now, but still gets that way by the end of the day. I am in love with this stuff. The scent is great, not too fragrant, but very pleasant. It lathers just enough to take off any makeup, even heavy eye shadow/liner. My pores shrank a week after using it. I love to pair it with their Hope in a Jar moisturizer before I apply makeup."
"Great board game. Very fun. The only issue is that some of the rules are poorly explained, so you'll have to work out a few ""house rules."""
"Our 75 pound, 7 month old Bernese Mountain Dog *loves* to chew, and has destroyed several toys ... but this one has lasted. She actually likes this toy as a regular ball, and will carry it around even without treats inside. When we first introduced this toy to her, she got frustrated easily because it was hard to get the treats out, but as she's gotten older (and much bigger), she's figured it out. The treats that are made to go inside this toy are a pain (they break going in, fall out easy, and I'm not a fan of the artificial coloring), so we just use our dog's favorite treats, and they seem to work better.Overall, the durability has been great for us, but the treat-dispenser design can be a bit frustrating for pets and humans alike."
"The pictured item is a ""corded"" leash. I received a ""tape"" leash which is exactly not what I wanted. Also it doesn't tell you the length of the leash. A large Flexi is usually 24feet. This one came to me as a 16foot. Now I have to return it and my dog is bummed."
I bought this mobile for my 3 month old. She enjoys the colorful rotating stars. The yellow globe in the middle does not really give off much light. The remote is very helping especially when you don't want to go into the room. You can just press the button from a distance. Overall the price and product were very satisfactory.
"There was not enough information about the item. If i knew what an eye link comunicator was i might buy it. It sounds fun! but seeing as i dont know waht it does or what it is i will not buy.Thank you,Cori"
Indigo Dog House Door - 29998 Indigo See Thru DoorNot the most water tight / airtight design out there. Not sure what good its actually doing.
This bed came amazon prime in 2 days and it was so perfect for her matching pink crate i just bought!!! Very affordable and also very soft and plush. Within 5 minutes my puppy stretched out and was snoozin away.
"We love these. Best ones we have ever used. Easy to install, our puppies adapted to having them on very quickly and were very happy to sit in their own bucket seat and be very happy and safe during our ride!! I am so impressed with this product. Others were clumsy and uncomfortable for our previous dogs. And I love that they are adjustable, so as the puppies grow, so can the tethers!!"
I love this product---my hair is so soft and mangeable. I am able to comg through it with no problem with no greesy look. I recommend it!
This is the Best shampoo I have found for my hairIt changes the texture of your hair and makes itvery soft. It is hard to find but worth looking for.
"I priced the exact same item at our local ""big box"" pet store, and saved about $25 ordering online (including shipping)."
"I thought our cat would take to this NO PROBLEM. Boy, was I wrong! I first wanted to purchase CitiKitty before we even had a cat. We used to have a cat before we moved, and the reason we didn't get another right away is because we simply didn't like the cat litter. No matter how many times it was changed, and how many different brands we tried, our house always smelled! So, when I saw CitiKitty on Shark Tank, I instantly became so excited! No more stinky house!Almost a year later, we finally picked up our kitty. I sound like one of those crazy moms, but he's really smart! He picks things up quickly. We could put the kitty litter anywhere, and he always found it on his own--even when we took him on vacation with us for a couple of weeks. He wasn't afraid of the toilet at all--and even tried to drink from it over the water in his bowl. We thought we were finally ready to use CitiKitty, and purchased the system, along with the flushable litter. He was perfectly fine with it on the toliet with the the rings intact. In fact, as I was setting it up, he kept putting his nose there to see what was going on, and used it within 5 minutes. After a couple of weeks, and no problems at all with accidents, we took out the first ring. That's where the trouble began...he started doing all his business on the floor by the toilet. We gave it another couple weeks to see if he would snap out of it. Well, there was improvement--he started peeing with the CitiKitty, but still pooping on the floor. With both my husband and I working full-time, it was quite a mess to clean when we came home.We finally put the insert back in so it didn't have any holes. Again, he used that perfectly fine. No problems! As soon as we took it out again (when I had spring break and had a lot of time off), he started pooping on the floor. The system came with helpful hints, and those haven't seemed to work out too well. Since he preferred to go around the sides and back of the toilet, we tried to block that area off and even sprayed kitty-off there so he wouldn't be tempted to poop. Sure enough, ten minutes later, there was a fresh pile waiting in the ""no go"" zone. We haven't given up yet, though. We are going to continue to try!"
"Im a fan of the texas chainsaw massacre remake, and for crhistmas my dad bought me the 12 inch leatherface, and it's pretty cool.the detail is awesome and it can be possed in many ways. Comes with a removable chainsaw and a severed arm and a base that assembles.It has a total of 6 points of articulation"
"It fits over some claws, not over others. It's nearly impossible to get them on your cat. I'm returning this product because it's fairly useless. The fit provided by soft claws is not very good and I'm certain they would fall off after a couple of days. I refuse to have my cat de-clawed because it's inhumane and so the search for something in between continues.Bottom line"
"I have 5 dogs and 3 have special diet need, but the freeze dried liver treats are something they all can have for daily treats. Smallpackages don't last very long and this brand has big pieces that are easy to give. Amazon.com is the only place I have found the large package."
"A great smelling cologne. Very clean smelling, not fruity at all. I usually wear it during formal events, like nights on the town, dates, banquets, etc. Can't go wrong here!"
this is my favorite cologne. i get compliments all the time. i wear it everywhere and people would ask what im wearing. and you can not go wrong with a 6.8oz bottle. i highly recommend!
"Playing dominoes is a fun and educational game that can be played by the whole family. We play with age groups form 7 & up. Sometimes a younger child may need some help, but usually they outplay us. We find Mexican dominoes the greatest and most fun. You will like this set. You can sort them to play as double sixes, nines, twelves, fifteens, or eighteens. You will not regret buying this set."
"I bought the recharging kit last Christmas because I thought it would save me money in the long run. It didn't take long to install.. a couple minutes at the most. And yes, I used the silver backplate instead of the original one. At first it worked fine, but then I began noticing that whenever me or my son would put it on the charging dock, the light would go off after a few seconds. To keep the light on, we have to keep jiggling the leapster around which is really annoying. Because of this problem, my son rarely plays with it anymore and I can't blame him.. Who wants to deal with a toy that lasts a few minutes before dying because it can't charge properly? The company really has to fix this problem because it's really dicouraging to buy a recharging system that doesn't work."
I purchased the Leapster at Christmas for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it! She especially loves the Sponge Bob Square Pants cartridge (sold seperately). My 7 year old son enjoys it also. He has been trying to swap his sister with his beloved GameBoy SP! I hope there are more cartridges that come out soon.
"My son absolutely loves this toy, and that's the only reason I put up with it. It plays out of sync AND out of tune. Even my husband, who can't hold a tune himself, notices how badly out of tune it is. GREAT idea, poor execution."
"I love this game. I grew up playing it with my mom (we played two decks apiece, double-sized blitz pile and 6 cards in the posts).Basically, it's a bit like the card game speed (only so much crazier)"
"I liked this product but I'm not sure if its 100% raw shea butter. It did seem to moisturize my hair and made it feel real soft and my skin seemed to like it as well and it did soothe my irritation. Since this purchase I've brought shea butter from another site and they both have the same smell but the other one I purchased had a different color almost an ivory color and it claims to be raw and undefined as well. It also moisturizes pretty well too. So I don't know if this product is really 100% raw or not but it did moisturize my skin and hair. Oh and the smell is very pronounced it kinda resembles a pine,nutty smell but once rub in and absorbed it goes away."
My wife and I just returned from a tour of Spain. I purchased this curling brush for our trip. It was dual voltage and that is the reason for my purchase. It worked superbly all through Spain. There was no switch you had to turn for the 220 voltage. The curling brush adjusts to 110 or 220 automatically. Very satisfied with this product and would recommend it for foreign travel.
"This is nice. Everything was fine on this order, on my order of July 6 20005 which I have since cancelled, that order was supposed to be delivered in November as of Feb I have not received it so it was cancelled. I will sometime think about ordering from your company brcause of this. It wwas aMcFarlane Tom Brady in a White Shirt released last Oct. I was told it would be delivered in Jan and never was. I did complain and I was given a $10 certifcate but that doesn't end the problem this was Christmas Gift from my son and when I learned it was comming it was too late for Christmas and most place were sold out by then. I have lost confidence that you can deliver, I have two more figures on backoder now. If I see these figures in the store I will buy them and cancelled yours. Dissapointed Tom Fischer"
My daughter was not at all interested in this toy. I think she may have played with it once and it held no interest in her at all. Boring for all!
"As a fan of the old 80's Joe cartoon, I can recall hordes of these 'Green Shrirts' running around in the background. Finally, Hasbro has given the backbone rank-and-file their own figures.On the whole, these six figures are much like any of the others being put out today in the Valor vs. Venom and the new Real American Hero lines in terms of quality. In other words, they are more likely than any other 3 3/4 inch figure to hold up to years of harsh play.As for uniqueness, I'd have liked to see a bit more variety and new equipment. 90% of the weapons in this set are repros from the 80's line- there are only 2 new weapons that I could determine. Even the backpacks are copies and the body molds appear to be retreads as well. However, the head sculpts are new and the helmets, as best as I can tell, are new. One major knock"
"My son has been wanting this playset since he got his first figure and saw the videos. I must say I was as excited to play with it as he was. I was a bit disappointed that the figures don't say more things when hooked up to the back pack. I thought they would say other phrases than what they normally say with their own backpack. It was also sort of a pain to put together. You had to align the tabs just so or it wouldn't pop together. Seems to me, that is a problem with most Fisher Price toys you have to assemble. It always seems like the plastic is cheap and flimsy. Once I assembled this toy though, it did seem sturdy enough.Also,there were about thirty stickers I had to apply myself. My son is three and very happy with the toy and plays with it constantly. We did have to rearrange his room a bit to accommodate it."
"My daughter got this toy before she could crawl. She liked the colored lights and to watch us make it play music. Eventually she learned to turn it on by kicking her feet. Later she banged on it and was fascinated when she could make it play. Now she has mastered it and likes to push it around the floor. You are going to be disappointed if you are expecting your child to learn anything about music from this toy, but it has been great to watch how her play with this toy progressed as our baby's motor and cognitive skills develop.It's been very sturdy. At first it made some weird sounds, but that went away. The music is OK, but we didn't get the toy for our enjoyment. It's fine for baby. The only negative -we had the same trouble other reviews have mentioned with getting that crazy wire out of the toy. It took lots of tugging with pliers!"
this thing only lasted 3 days!i mean really.i charged it up and it worked fine.but it only lasted about 5 minutes then i had to charge it again.when i looked under it i noticed that stiafom was breaking off!on the 3rd day i charged it up and it never worked again!!!!!!so i went back to toysrus and renturnd the piece of crud.do never buy this toy!!!!!!!!
"I was a little worried about the durability of the ball, especially with my golden retriever/chow mix (who's jaws can crack through bone like tissue paper), but was extremely pleased that, after several days of determined chewing, all she could do was scratch the surface of the outer ball. The inner ball rattles around when the ball is rolled, which definitely drives my dogs nuts, and really does keep them entertained with the ball longer than with other toys.The only reason I wouldn't give this toy 5 stars is because of the central ball. While the outer shell is make of thick, rigid plastic, the central ball is made of very thin plastic and is filled with air. Unfortunately, within days of getting the ball, my border collie figured out she could step on the inner ball through one of the openings, deflate the ball, and the ball will fall right out. Naturally, she then chewed the ball to pieces in a fit of triumph, which rendered the toy useless.However, it was easy to grab another ball from around the house (a squeaker ball, actually) which was made of a much more durable and rigid plastic, that was malleable just enough to squeeze into the shell and effectively make our own version of the toy (which squeaks).So, overall the toy is great for hardy chewers, but not so great for dogs who are a little too smart for their own good."
"I bought this for my husband who works with his hands and comes home quite grimy. Of course all of that grime sticks under his fingernails and leaves his hands most unsightly. He previously had a wooden spa-type nail brush and that worked ok but the wood eventually split and became mildewy after many months exposed to water. This one works great for him. He commented at how the single row of bristles worked better under his nails than the wooden, boars hair brush had. His hands look better too. We would definitely recommend this brush. Thanks, Tweezerman, all of your products are awesome!"
Like all Master Replicas Star Wars FX lightsabers this product does not disappoint the hard-core fan.The saber is bright and the sound produced is great despite the handles small size. I purchased this as a birthday gift for an older friend (though he's still a big kid at heart) and he was really pleased to add it to his geeky collection! His four year old daughter also loved the saber and begs her dad to have a play anytime she sees it.
"This toy is fun for my two dogs to play with. It is a little heavy for the puppy but the almost year old lab is fine carrying it around. Hol-ee toys are great for dogs to play with, I recommend getting one and they come in many sizes and shapes!"
The boys can't go to bed without one last session with Hullabaloo. Mom enjoys it too.
The Frontline Plus that I received was not in a box that was packaged by the manufacturer. They were individual syringes in a zip-lock bag. I do NOT feel safe administering this product to my dog. I would not recommend ordering this product.
Count us as enthusiastic fans of this very fun and funny game. You'll be laughing every time the made-up sayings get read out loud. You just can't believe what some people come up with and that's the beauty of it. This game really is a must-have.
"DO NOT BUY THIS LEASH!!!! PLEASE.This past weekend we were camping at a State Park. We were walking the Upper gorge trail when our 18 month old puppy spotted a chipmunk. We hit the button and the leash snapped at the nylon 1"" above the collar connection. The puppy feel 200 feet straight off the gorge and another 12 feet when he bounced over the lower trail into the river. Amazingly I can say he survived after many rescue efforts and surgery at Cornell.BEWARE OF THIS LEASH. COMPANY HAS NOT EVEN CONTACTED ME!!!!!"
Again this is a very cute Item but $29.00! come on! I bought this same thing today for ...are you ready for this...$5.00! at the dollar general store!
"Ok so I bought this product because I saw it on the tv show Shark Tank and thought I would give it a try. Well, it has been over 4 days and I've done everything by the book but my kitty will not have anything to do with the CitiKitty. Instead of going where she should she found a place in the house to relieve herself instead. So, I'm back to the traditional box. I'm hoping to give this another run because for the money that I paid for it I really had high hopes especially after reading all of the great reviews. It looked promising but I'm really disappointed. Maybe it is because it's so flimsy. It's very thin and seems very cheaply made. It really resembles a punch out card template. I will give an update if anything changes but as of now the CitiKitty is a No-No."
The wife loves this product. It helps her skin far and above any other product she has tried. She will be buying this again.
"I replaced my older drinkwell with the platinum model (since it got good reviews). My cats loved the old fountain & I thought this would be an upgrade. The required water level is too high for them. They like some more space on top. A couple have difficulty judging the water level. Also, when the level goes down (even a little), the tank dispenses more water & this gurgles & also scares them. I (they) much prefer the regular drinkwell."
"I like fragrance for men. I made my boyfriend happy buy using this product and at the same time myself, since I am using it time to time."
"I love this product!! my hair dresser used it on my hair and I had to get one. I love it!! This is by far the best flat iron, yes it is even better than the Chi. I have long thick hair and it takes me half the time and i get salon results!! you wont be disappointed"
"I was very excited to find that the toy was not overly large. It is big enough for little hands but not so big that it takes over. I love that it sings a song for each letter with the letters sounds, and will also sing the alphabet. My one year old has had it for less than a day and can almost play with it independently!"
"My family loves this game. We play it with our 4 and 5 yr old boys a lot. I like the combination of the older movie and current movie questions. My only complaint is with the metal character pieces. They are pretty flimsy and we have already broken one which cannot be repaired and I don't know where to buy a replacement piece. Other than that, the game is good for families with kids of all ages."
"I have a very destructive dog. She is an American Eskimo and is far too intelligent for normal toys. They bore her or she destroys them, generally within minutes. Other treat dispenser toys, including the standard Kong, are too easy for her. Enter, the Buster Cube. I was recommended this toy from a local trainer who has had great luck with it. For my dog, this is not a very difficult toy to figure out, although compared to other toys she has had, this has taken considerably longer for her to master. About 2 days in, she's able to flip the cube on soft carpet and turn it successfully until all of the food we put inside of it is gone.We enjoy feeding her meals with the cube, as it helps stimulate her mind, keeps her occupied, and feeds her all at the same time. This is also one of the first toys that she can't just pick up, chew, crack, shred, or decapitate. I love this and have suggested it to several other pet owners."
Product was just as advertised. Arrived on time (although we ordered the week of Christmas) and was packaged well. Great gag gift from grandfather to 19 year old grandson...a family tradition since grandson was little.
We just received the soft stroller bar. Our 5 month old loves it! She reaches for all of the animals. It keeps her entertained while we stroll around the block.
"I have medium brown, undyed, healthy hair. I bought this hoping for a little extra shine. It was a kit similar to a hair dye. I used it exactly as instructed. My hair is no shinier, and seems a little more coarse than before. It may have lightened my hair one shade but it's hard to tell. This product was a disappointment and I will never buy it again."
This is the best game ever! It is so much fun and I end up in a laughing fit every time!!! :) I definitely recommend it!!
"Was tired of all the dirty paws and fur on my leather seats so bought the Solvit seat cover. Love it! It's easy to take on and off and completely covers the seat. Haven't tried to wash it yet, but it's made well and there shouldn't be a problem. Highly recommend this product."
"I bought this because I liked the way it smelled in a magazine, but after you apply it, it starts to turn into a different scent...something that's very strong, makes you want to sneeze, and I would agree that the smell it turns into reminds me of something cheap...."
"I would probably never buy travel curlers without looking at them. I have moderately curly hair that gets a little unruly so I need just a few electric curlers. These do not have any prongs to help grab.As a travel set there is not a place that holds the cord......it is just out and flops around so that is not put away neatly in the little red case, which the picture does not show the cord. So in summary if you had straight hair I would think these curlers would not stay in your hair very well they would slip out and the compactness with cord is not good. They do get very hot."
"I saw great reviews, and I saw those that said these break the nail. They are SO sharp that that they cut through nails as if they were butter, but the truth is they do leave you with mildly raggedy nails. I don't mind using a file, but I find myself going back time and again to grab a file. I'm thinking these probably aren't worth the price, given the ragged edges,"
"I got this for my daughter at 8 months and 6 months later she still plays with it everyday. We saw a benefit immediately when she used it for standing. We really feel it helped her with leg coordination and balance.*** Warning***This toy is not the most stable when leaned against. We keep it diagnol in a corner so that it can't tip over. This toy has fallen over and backwards on top of our daughter. No harm done, but it does scare her. Even now, if not up against something, she easily pushes it over.This toy ""teaches"":NumbersLettersColorsOppositesRhymingTexturesCause & EffectAND MORE.....My daughter still finds new ways for this toy to entertain her. She loves the music, she loves putting the balls down the slide, she's had phases where she HAS to flip the little ""change-mode"" book, or she must push down the frog.I would recommend buying this at 6-10 months and will last a loooong time. I don't see how someone could be disappointed with this toy. It is well worth the money for the hours and hours of ""entertainment"" (a.k.a. peace and quiet...sort of)!"
"This item came to me exactly on time, and was the correct item although the valve that you push down to make the perfume come out, does not work. Is there anything I can do about this? Who do I need to contact?"
"... If u take it from me u will love this blade. Driger V. if u get a driger u will win almost every battle! whe u launch driger (f,v,s,)any driger. twist your launcher and u will hit a Driger claw! but u have to twist your launcher really godd or it wont work"
"Without a battery pack, which was supposed to be included in the purchase, according to ScatMat instructions, the ScatMat is useless. What should I do?"
This is the best game. We play it every day at dinner time. I don't know why you don't see it in the stores more often. We have had a game for the last several years this purchase was a spare because I had such a hard time finding another one.
This is a light very floral fragrance that has the remarkable ability to brighten any mood. DaliFlor is spring. DaliFlor is open. DaliFlor is feminine.
"neopets game!!this is amazing!!this was handy when i was out of internet hours lol, really its an excellent game to keep the kiddies occupied, almost as good as the real thing."
"This is a wonderful toy for your child's imagination. My kids love these pet shop toys. We've never had any problems with the bobble head designs either. They are durable, and they play with them for hours. What I don't understand is why these private sellers are allowed to charge such high, major high prices for these toys. You can buy them at any toy retailer, they aren't collector's items, so why such a high price? Certainly, they aren't worth the price of seventy dollars. You can buy this same item for under fifteen dollars anywhere. Save your money, and shop somewhere else."
The mat works but it is a bit small. My cat tend to jump over it.
"I have all over grey, which I color dark brown. This was a very small amount of color. It was hard to mix in the ""scoop"" provided. It did cover my roots, but only just. There is no conditioner included in this kit. I left it on 10 minutes and color is darker than indicated on the box. I will not buy it again."
Pretty sweet version of monopoly. The characters are very well made. My only complaint was that the houses and hotels are the same as the regular monopoly other then the colors. I would of hoped since they call them movie sets/studios that they would have them look like a movie set or something.
"The FURminator is a great product. I can't believe the amount of hair removed from my dog in a single brushing! It's amazing. I have a boarder Collie and she leaves hair everywhere! Since using the FURminator two - three times a week it has greatly reduced the amount of hair on my carpets. I never realized how loose her undercoat was until using this product. You'll never find a brush that works as fantastic as this. Recommend it for all animals, short hair and long hair, not just for cats or dogs, works great on the ferret too!!"
"This is a quality cologne, and it seems perfect for a young professional. I use it as my default work cologne. However, at least on my dry-ish skin, the cologne wears out absurdly quickly. The top notes seem to be gone after less than a couple hours, and I doubt even the deeper notes are detectable after four or five hours. Even at the beginning, it doesn't have much power, which is a positive quality if you're going for subtlety.If you're looking for a cologne with a punch, go for something with more musk and more staying power. In the land of men's cologne, this one is a bit of a boy."
"SgriVectin-HS Deep /Wrinkle Serum-----Don't waste your money!!! I bought 3 bottles!!!! I've used 1 1/2 bottles and I think this stuff may be aloe vera at best! ""Deep"" NOT(!!!!) It stays right on the surface of your skin and gets sort of ""filmy""/crusty!! I do not know how these people can sell these samples on e-Bay legally, because I'm thinking all they have gotten is a bunch of empty bottles that they have filled with something. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (especially those that do not have a box.)"
Have a full size Doberman and a mini-mix that weighs 23 pounds. They both go crazy when i get the fresbe out and can not wait to chase it. They both chew and it has held up well.This is a definite purchase for any active dogs that love to chase!!
"I love Sunforgettable, it kept me from becoming burnt during an out door, sunny college graduation."
"I bought this while I was in Greece because it was so hot and I wanted a fragrance that wasnt too strong but had a clean smell. My grandmother and my mom loved the fragrance so much that I had to buy a couple bottles for them when i got to the US! I was also surprised by how moisturizing the ""water"" is. FYI, it does smell a lot like mint tea but i think it also has a slightly flowery scent to it. Excellent for summer! Great for all ages!Oh and I know it says in the description section that you should buy the body lotion and shower gel to make the fragrance last but you really dont need to buy anything but the water. Even though the scent is not strong, it definitely lasts. Plus its small enough to fit in your purse if you do need another spritz."
I gave this to my granddaughter - age 3 and she loves it - just be sure you select the right games.
"Just got this as a birthday present from my daughter, who has been straightening her hair for years and is quite the expert, and I am thrilled with this product. Nice wide plates work on large sections of hair at a time which is perfect for those with long, thick hair like me who don't want to spend an hour on their hair. Multiple heat settings - this baby gets HOT! My hair was so hot when it came out of the plates that it hurt my hands! My hair is very curly and it usually takes me at least three passes to get the curl out, but with this one it was basically completely straight on one long, slow pass. Nice and sturdy, and I love the finger rest on the end so you can use two hands to work. No need to spend tons of money on an expensive straightener; this one does the job!"
K9 is cute as a button and we love hearing his voice but there are glitches. It seems K9 doesn't always operate on command as there seems to be some sort of electronic disconnect. Other than that we just love this toy. K9 has joined the Daleks so we will have the perfect Dr. Who household.
"Vector Prime is not a new look for Optimus Prime, he is a new character. While his transformation isnt very complex the look of both modes is something not seen before. The robot has a look that suggest a Knight about him. One thing to note is that due to safety laws his sword and wings are made from a soft rubbery plastic that has been known to droop. The Galaxy Force version doesnt have this problem and has a better colour scheme. That said, if you dont want an imported item this is still a fantastic item."
"OK, I'll admit just like the rest of these reviews ... I can't believe I'm writing this review on a pooper scooper. However, my experience with this product is just so amazing that I felt compelled to write about it.First off, I live in St. Louis, where there is a hogepodge of various types of grass. When I first opened this product, I thought, how is this mini rake going to pick up the 'stuff'? Particularly in zoisa and kentucky blue grass areas. Well folks, I tell ya, it does. And it does it so well that I actually look forward to keeping the lawn clean. One quick scoop is all it takes. I'm 5'11"" and have had no issue with bending down because of the handle length. I merely stand right next to it and voila, it's in the scoop. I put the remains in the compost pile and I'm done. Our eight year old whippet dog mix and my kids can now roam the yard without my anxiety that they would be stepping into a doggie land mine!The product is very sturdy and is crafted to last. It does not get as dirty as you would think. In fact, I often wonder if it had touched any of it at all. I've had it outside in the rain a few times and there is no sign of rust or corrosion. I should have bought this thing a long time ago."
"I bought each of my kids a kit. These are not only fun but they are educational. The kids got to read a bit about each planet.The kid included the paint, all peices, mini sandpaper and everything required. You did not need any additional peices to build this. The sandpaper helps the paint stick to the plastic planets. My kids liked that they could change how the planets were set up and which was positioned where.This is a great kit when your child is learning the solar system in school or better to give them an introduction before that lesson starts!"
This is not a complicated device with all sorts of technicalities and buttons to press so you can adjust this or adjust that - which is the reason for four stars and not five. It's real simple
"Somebody bought this toy for my daughter's 1st birthday (only it's yellow, not white). It's an okay toy, but the switches and knobs are really hard to push/turn. She is only able to get the blue #3 animal to pop since the button is easy to push. The one that looks like a key is hard to turn, and if you turn it and the animal pops up, you have to turn the key more to get the lid to close. The other switches are really hard to push/pull. My daughter tries to push the other buttons, but it takes a lot of strength to push them."
"(this is an earier bottle color, the color has changed now I think)Right now the only conditioner myself or my wife can use is this one. I am so allergic that she is restricted to the same products I am. Our skin types are different, so this is very time consuming and I am thankful for her patience.As a conditioner, this is just ""pretty good"" according to my wife (3-4 stars). But as a non-allergetic product, there is nothing I have found better.The only other thing that has worked is plain extra virgin olive oil. The problem is that it must be spread very lightly with a comb or brush or we tend to break out from too much oil on the skin.My background:I am extremely allergic to all shampoos / conditioners / deodorants / etc."
"I'm not really a fan. What I get from this fragrance is amber and citrus, and the two bodies of notes aren't well mixed. They don't seem to work well together at all. This fragrance seemed to be in a constant state of discord- it just didn't gel for me."
I have played this game since high school and I still own it at 32. While the box has bite the dust everything else is still around in one way or another. Great game but time consuming. If you like risk you will love A&amp;A.
Assembly was quick and easy. I'm not sure why some of the reviewers had issues. It only took me about 5-10 minutes. It took about the same amount of time for my Golden to take to it. She loves it. I don't foresee her using it as a chew toy like the other pillow-type beds (which she has made quick work of). I'm very happy with this purchase! A decent price to boot!
"Works really well on short hair dogs. My lab absolutely loves it and treats it as a back scratch, but the comb gets caught on my longer hair dog. You'll need to use it outside or somewhere where there's easy cleanup since it will lift all the excess hair but not necessarily keep it on the tool."
I love this de-shedding tool. It is shocking to see how much loose dead hair comes off.It would be all over you or your house without this device. The price was amazing. Tryand do better pricewise - I doubt it.....
The Bijan Line smells wonderful. I have had the chance to smell and purchase almost all scents from Bijan. I'm Loving it.
"Used this once. It felt great on my back warmed up real nice with my husbands hands and it made the massage great!I couldn't smell the almond fragrance, I was hoping it would smell like almond jello, mm that stuff Is yummy. a little disappointed about that but wasn't too bothered.Don't think I'm a strong believer of aromatherapy.Would recommend the oil it feels great on my skin! Aso I have a back tattoo and was a little hesitant about using lotions and oils which had dyes or fragrances (heard about horror stories of tattoos ruined) and this oil didn't seem to have any of them and my tattoo is unharmed, no allergic reaction!Highly recommended!"
My son got this toy for his 1st birthday. He loves the little pegs that pop out when you roll it. Fun little ball.
I had gotten a perm and had my hair colored at the same time and well you know girls that is a very costly visit to the salon. I wanted to take care of both additions to my hair and was recommended by my colorist to purchase Redken. Her salon offered the product but being a wise buyer I declined her offer to purchase from her and went to the Amazon website and took care of business. I'm still using the product and it's been a while but the bottles are very big and should last a while. The promise to keep your color lasting longer has been kept and I love the way my hair is easy to comb after shampooing and condtitiong. I find that I only need a very small amount of condtioner and only need to leave it on for just a few seconds; well around 30 seconds then rinse. I have fine hair and leaving on longer would take out some of the body. I think this shampoo would be great for any hair to be honest. I remember one time on Oprah that they were saying that the shampoo isn't a big deal that most of them are alike and put your money into the conditioner. Well for me I think both are important and I would invest in a shampoo that doesn's strip your color or perm out of your hair. I would recommend this product to anyone and will be buying again. The price is very fair for the length of time it last and the quality of the product.
"This is a great toy. However, if you want a kid who is not older than 10 years to put this together, you are in for some trouble.Bandi Gundum model come in many different level. Most of the lower end model is named ""High Grade"" HG. The finish product is still very good quality and is easy enough. On average, a HG model has less than 200 parts. The next level up is ""Master Grade"" MG. A teenager should be able to put it together in about 1 to 2 weeks. The highest level of model from Bandi is called ""Prefect Grade"". This is not for kids. Nearly all part of the model is movable and could have more than 1000 parts. I will take more than a month to accomplish this.So, go ahead and buy this model for a teenager who is into Gundam and they will have fun making it."
"My son is still too little to understand stacking the stars back on the stacker, but he loves activating the music and watching the stars light up to different classical tunes. Fisher Price has made a classic toy even better with lights, music and multi-colors. Makes a great baby shower gift."
WhAT A GREAT FAMILY GAME. WE ARE NOT ALL INTO WRESTLING BUT THIS GAME IS FUN AND MY KIDS HIGLY ENJOY PLAYING IT. uS ADULTS LIKE PLAYING IT TOO.
Nice and sturdy. Well made....the first was damaged during shipment but had no problem on the return and received replacement quickly.
"I used ""intensive"" moisturizers on my very dry and calloused feet daily, without any improvement at all. I received a sample packet of Udderly Smooth at a fair, and used it two weeks ago. It IMMEDIATELY transformed my feet. Honestly, after one application (after shower, before bed) it was like 20 years just disappeared off of them. I used the sample two weeks ago, and my feet are still very soft and healed. This stuff is amazing!"
"I use these pads when I start to notice zits on my chin and forehead. At night, I wash my face first with a loofah and then apply the pad without any moisturizer. Most of the time, the zits have gone done by morning!"
"This is the best deshedding tool. It's easy, removes lots of hair and undercoat. I am very pleased with it. If you have small dog then small furminator would be ok. I have two Labradors Retrievers so I needed the biggest blade. I used to have lots of hair from both of them and now hardly nothing. Do make sure you use it every week at the beginning to get rid of all the hair and undercoat, after that it should be easy."
This machine is great to take along on road trips or for a wait in a restaurant. Just like watching a little TV and there are various vidoes you can get depending on the age of the child watching it. My 7-and 5-year olds make great use of it when we're somewhere where a bigger video player would not work (like a restaurant or in line somewhere or a doctors' office or whatever).
"I purschased this figure, along with several others of the Schleich line, and was amazed at how amazing they truly are. The figures are well sculpted, well painted, and very durable - meaning that if I WAS to let my son have a go at them, they could hold up to the punishment.They are accurately detailed, with no traces of 'fantasy' or 'mythology' to them - no flaming swords, or oddly shaped weapons and armour. The knights are superbly crafted and historically designed.If I may quote the previous post of EquisNiger"
"Before purchasing this activity center, I had read some reviews of this item as well as some others. And the one negative I found for this one is that the paint chips easily- which I have found to be true. However, It's not something you can't control or fix from time to time and my daughter loves this toy! She started playing with it at 7 months and in the past couple of months has not tired of playing with it."
"I wasnt able to get this to stick to a wall but I have placed it on a window next to my sons portable co-sleeper since I cant attach most other mobiles to it. I currently have it in the Jeep. I dont usually have a problem with it being knocked down but my husband is bigger so he will usually knock it off the handle while removing the carseat from the car. Is still worth it, keeps my baby happier in the car than without it."
I've never tried this product before now but I like it. I use the clay mask early in the week and then use this one later in the week if my skin is very dry because it moisturizes well while evening out my skin.
"This is great fun for the whole family. Every time we get together, my family always says, ""Bring Finish Line."" We make the players sing the song answers. This is a great test to see just how well you paid attention in school, and in life. Can't wait to get the new booster pack of cards! If you like game night, this is a MUST HAVE!"
"I thought I had found something that would last for my dog. Less than 48 hours after giving it to him, he managed to make 2 holes in the toy. That is not as fast as he does for most toys. (I have a 35 lbs. Border Collie, Terrier Mix that normally can destroy a stuffed animal or toy with squeakers in less than 5 minutes.)The toy feels tough. It is stuffed with the white stuffing and has 2 squeakers in it. It is a piece of firehose with canvas on the ends and they are double stitched."
"Au The Blanc arrived today in perfect condition, still sealed in its box and 100% authentic. The scent is citrusy and bright at first, then dries down to a soft skin musk, not the skunky musk that so many fragrances tend to settle into. The scent was truly calming. Would purchase this item from amazon.com again."
I bought this for mobile for my baby boy about a year ago. He did not seem to be very interested at first but now he enjoys looking at it. Actually both my 2 year old and my 1 year old enjoy the mobile. They only problem I had was attaching the mobile to the crib but I believe it is because the design of the crib is old. I strongly recommend this product for entertaining but not for sleeping.
"I have very sensitive, very oily skin. My skin reacts to most products, I cannot use many eye creams/makeups because they will irritate my eyes. I break out very easily using most products. The majority of moisturizers are out, even oil-free.Enter Jojoba Oil. Hello, skin-saver.My many uses:1. Makeup remover/Face Wash - Better than any traditional makeup remover, and you only need a few drops.2. Moisturizer - Remember folks, I have oily skin. Jojoba oil amazingly reduces oil over-production, and keeps skin soft and smooth without breaking me out, or drying me out from using harsh facewash.3. Eye cream - At night, I slather it on.4. Scalp/Hair Treatment - Every week I massage my scalp, and let it sit overnight. Shampoo is very harsh on hair.5. Dry/Cracked Feet/Legs - A few drops on their own or mixed in with moisturizer works wonders.Why Jojoba Oil is different? The Jojoba Tree Extract is actually a wax ester (not an oil). This ester is more similar to the human skin's natural oil than any other fruit or plant based oil extract."
"I love this lotion, the smell is delicious and I feel my skin very soft after use it. THIS SELLER WAS VERY FAST AND RESPONSIBLE WITH THE SHIPPING... AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE. I'll buy again, THANKS!"
Straightens pretty good for what I needed it for but the old fashion stove iron presses better for entire head straightening.
"We just got a 7 week old mini doxie puppy and bought this crate both as a housebreaking tool and a ""bedroom"". The fact that it has a divider screen makes it perfect for both. You can make the crate smaller for a young puppy to discourage eliminating in the cage and yet you don't need to buy a new crate when he is full grown. You just take the divider out. It is a very sturdy pen for the money, yet portable because it folds flat. I know I sound like an ad but I am just saying that all the things the company says about it are true."
"Finally, someone made a moisturizer that doesn't cause rashes on my face or nasal drip from the fragrances and chemicals. This truly is amazing moisturizer. Nice job Earthwise Beauty!"
"This toy was the BEST when my son was learning to sit up by himself. We would put the Discovery Ball in front of him and he could grab it and spin it, and it would make noises! He absolutely loved this toy.Once he started crawling and being more mobile, it wasn't so interesting anymore - but I believe it served it's purpose."
"My dog, the destroyer of all things squeaky, has had this toy for nearly a month and it's still going strong. I examine it every few days and there aren't even any chunks missing yet. I'm not sure if this toy is extra tough - or if the awkward shape just makes it harder to teat apart - but she loves to play with this toy, and I love that I'm not going to have to buy a replacement every other week. It's a win-win."
"I really like Nioxin. It doesn't promise new hair growth, but it does give you a perception of fuller hair, at least it does to me. I also think my hair has gotten a little stronger or thicker. Unlike some, I like the smell. It reminds me of Sea Breeze. It's invigorating on the scalp and makes my scalp feel fresh and alive."
I have been using straightening irons for many years. I always used cheaper models (usually in the $30 to $40 dollar range) and I can say without a doubt that this iron is worth the extra money. I actually wish I would have purchased it a few years ago. It definitely saves time!
"This is an excellent game that's good for all ages. It's like a larger, alternate version of tic tac toe. I loved playing this as a kid and still love it as an adult! Makes a great gift!"
This was a great Christmas present for my daughter who was approaching 2 at the time. She was already learning her colors and learning how to coordinate puzzle shapes. I thought having 9 puzzles with the 9 different colors would pose as difficult but she quickly realized she needed to sort by color first and then put the puzzles together. At 2 1/2 she still doesn't get bored with it.Puzzle pieces are sturdy. Just don't let them chew on it.
This product works pretty well but can not be relied upon by itself to completely clear up oily skin. It should be used with a good moisturizer if it's going to really do it's job well.
I like the regular Realm for Women but this stuff stinks!!! It is very strong and actually smells like a men's cologne...I gave it to my husband.
Removes and prevents brown stains under the eyes of my cream-colored toy poodle.Make sure you use the amount suggested on the container. This really works. Haven't found a better price than on Amazon.
My daughter loves these!!! She grabs them and shakes them and looks at the color and bobs her head!! It's adorable!! The colors are said as it lights up the colors so it is very educational I can also switch it to spanish!!!! I was a little disappointed that both dont light up but I guess that wouldn't be the best! ANYWAYS GET THIS!!! Very educational and perfect for any kid thats a fan of lights & music!
"Though this is technically a ""board game"", there isn't really a board beyond the scoring track. Instead, it's more like a puzzle where each side matches every other side but the pictures might not flow together seamlessly. I won't get into a summary of the rules since I'm sure other reviewers have covered that.Carcassonne has fairly simple gameplay that results in complicated games with many turns and a variety of strategies (i.e. Go for lots of short roads and two tile cities, build big and risk not finishing things, or devote followers early to farming to reap rewards later in the game)My personal recommendation for learning the game or introducing new players to it is to ignore farming the first time through until everyone is comfortable with the core road / city rules, has seen all the tiles, and understands the scoring system.Some flaws with Carcassonne"
Love this set! I bought several new because they were so beautiful and I knew they'd soon be rare! A must for any LOTR collector! Well packaged and easily displayed in the box.
This is a great little scissor. I use it primarily for eyebrows but can be used in other areas of the face. Be careful. Make sure you SEE the tips of the scissor when you cut (as you should with any scissor).
I was very happy with the service. The items I purchased were shipped in good condition and in a timely fashion. I would highly recommend making purchases through them.
"My hairstylist recommended this hair dryer--it is the one she uses on my hair at the salon. My hair always looks better after she styles it--and I use the same shampoo and brush that she does--that meant it was time to invest in the dryer. The dryer is pretty quiet and light. Seems like it is made well enough--must be since my stylist has been using it everyday (multiple times) for more than 3 years. I looked at upgrading since there are newer CHI's out there--but this one was cheaper and I knew for sure that it would do a good job. I don't regret not getting one of their fancier more powerful models--I'm not trying to fry my hair, just dry and shape it. After my other professional hairdryer died (did a good job--but got crushed in an accident), I began using a $20 cheapie--what a mistake. When people tell you that all hairdryers are the same, it is because they don't really know. My research has indicated that CHI is only brand on the market with full ceramic components--not just ceramic coated. I really didn't want to spend all this money--but my hair actually looks much better and others have noticed. I would recommend this dryer--it was worth the price to me."
"We received two of these as gifts, the Peapod and the Snuggle Bug for my 1.5 year old twin boys. We went to the regular toy store looking for a doll they could play with and pretend to care for (our babysitter just had a baby and we thought this would be good for them.) but found a bunch of cheap, plastic, wet-yourself, crying and SUPER PINK dolls, not one that would be at all desirable for future daddies. We found these in a specialty toy store and love them. My boys cuddle them and pretend to feed them from their zippy cups, they even bring them to me and tell me the baby is stinky and we change its diaper using one of their newborn cloth diapers. They think this is hysterical. I love this baby, it's soft and cute, and perfect for 1-year-olds. It is great for a girl or a boy, the girl doll is pink but not obnoxiously so, the boy is a nice blue. I highly recommend these for your little one, they are a nice, soft first baby."
"With Christmas advancing upon us like impending doom, once again we jettison all those pesky thoughts of recycling, carbon footprints and being sensible with money out of our minds and begin the annual, increasingly grim farce that is Christmas. Yes, you too can line up in supermarkets with more food than you could hope to eat in a month (all for one day) whilst listening to ""Feed the World"". You too can continue the pointless, hollow sham of sending Christmas cards to everyone you know for no reason at all. And yes, you too can continue the obscene tradition of spending more and more money on gifts, cursing yourself for giving into the hype - yet again - safe in the knowledge that you'll be dancing to the same tune like a tinseled up automaton in 12 months time.So with that in mind, The Curmudgeon brings you all a seasonal warning; if you're buying gifts for kids, BE CAREFUL what you buy. In this day and age of information at our fingertips, there really is no excuse for buying bad toys. A quick Google search will give you all the advice on what to buy, as well as ""reviews"" from the usual idiots on Amazon who seem to think their opinions actually count for something, (your humble narrator obviously excluded). But you just know some non-clued up granny or well meaning but dumb mother is going to shell out hard earned money to earn their child's love, only to see little Timmy's excited, hopeful face fall as they rip open that carefully wrapped parcel and discover what is, essentially, a steaming festive turd.We're talking jigsaw puzzles of animals. We're talking those creepy Marvel figures with the dopey smiling faces and glassy eyes. We're talking bargain bin merchandise of movies no-one liked (The Mummy 3 action figures, anyone?) And yes, we're talking this atrocity - the Transformers version of Boba Fett.It's quite a perverse skill, I suppose; take two undoubtedly very cool things - Boba Fett and Transformers - and combine the two to make something so wretched it deserves to be placed on top of every crackling yuletide log under the fireplace. An obvious example of ""well, kids like Star Wars. And kids like Transformers. Isn't there a way we can combine the two?"" Answer being - no. No you can't. Because, unlike adults, kids aren't stupid about this sort of thing. No kid in it's right mind is going to accept the fact that BOBA FETT TRANSFORMS INTO HIS SPACE SHIP.Believe it or not, kids don't just take thing with wheels and run them up the furniture making ""brrrrm"" noises. They create stories based on what they know and have seen on TV. And how the hell does a kid fathom out Boba Fett turning into his damn ship?? I'm not saying kids are all ""that's not considered canon"" nerds (that comes later) but give them some credit.Taking two famous brands and forcing them together could, I suppose, work. If done well. With a little care and attention to detail, the merging of two vastly different entities could perhaps bring something new and exciting for kids to play with.But LOOK at the picture of Boba Fett here. Seriously, look at it. Is Boba pregnant? Is he wearing a tracksuit? Does he have Jabba's lunch stuffed up his jacket? And why does he have a hunchback? One of the most iconic, cool characters in the entire Star Wars universe suddenly morphed into a spindly-armed blue and grey Sumo wrestler. Gee.. thanks Hasbro.Someone, somewhere, is buying this awful toy, and some kid, somewhere, is pretending to like it. Don't let it be you."
"It took my dog a couple of days to like this toy. At first she wanted nothing to do with it but now it is her favorite. She discovered that if she shakes the stump, the squirrels fly out, so no more digging around inside. She loves to grab the stump and shake it (being part terrier, it is very vigorous shaking indeed). The squirrels are all missing their faces now, but still well loved and squeaked when found. We are quite amazed at how much our dog loves this toy and my husband keeps telling me what a good choice I made. The nieces and nephews were hoping the dog wouldn't like it and I'd give it to them instead... The kids thought it was the greatest thing."
So glad this product is around! I have a Bichon Frise and had tried every thing for Tear stains ... nothing worked until I found this. I will never try anything else there is no need. Angels Eyes is great!
"Our cat has been spraying for years and we've tried several different cleaners. This is the first one we've found that seems to decrease the problem. I recommend you use it in conjunction with Feliway - clean the area, then spray Feliway to make your cat think it doesn't need to spray there again."
"This game is a classic because it's funny when other players CAN'T draw and surprising when they can. That's why I like all of the party games that give you an opportunity to discover the hidden talents of your friends and family like Rigmarole, Taboo and Cranium."
An absolutely wonderful harness. I've been using harnesses for years and with one I noticed my dog pulled less than half as hard right from the start. I was so impressed I bought 2 more for my other 2 kids. There's something about that front hook-up with Easy Walk harnesses that gets a dog's attention right off.(Amended 12/24/2011)These harnesses continue to amaze me. Years of being dragged along by Louisiana Catahoula Leopards can be tough. Not anymore.
"Sooo basically this smells great. I was afraid to buy perfume online just because I couldn't smell it first, but the price was fair and it seemed promising. I love this stuff and I will have to buy more!"
"The scoop part is huge so it is great for pet owners who have to deal with ""large clumps"". I really love the fact the bags are in the handle, no more searching for one. The handle is big and fat to accommodate the bags but I really like that, makes for an easier grip when scooping. The area where you insert the bags is basically a twist open and you drop the bag roll in, very easy to refill. I also love the fact that the bags are biodegradable, environmentally friendly is always good. With a 120 count bag refill being listed on amazon for $10 - I will be getting refills and continue to use this scoop. I would recommend this to any cat owner."
"This pet barrier is a descent product overall. It just has issues with the fasteners falling off. While it was in place it kept my two large labs separated from the rest of the vehicle as described. However, after only a day or so it falls down. I followed the instructions to a t, cleaning the vinyl surface with rubbing alcohol to prep the area to mount the Velcro like anchors. I am still trying to find something to anchor the barrier to the car with. So at this time I can't even use the gate until I can find something to keep it up with. disappointed. Good luck keeping this thing in place."
My daughter received this toy for her first birthday. While we thought it would be the perfect kitchen because of its size (we are limited on space)we found out otherwise. The size is the problem. It is not very sturdy and when my daughter opens the doors the kitchen easily falls over. Also there are not many accessories and she easily loses interest.
Awesome stuff. I am on my second bottle. Works! Smells nice for days even weeks.
My dogs LOVE this product. They beg for them. They also came recommended by our animal trainer. My only issue is that I took advantage of the Super Shipper Saver and for some reason it took almost a month to get here. VERY VERY slow shipping.
"Hi. I have used Frontline plus for years. This weekend. I had rescued a small breed puppy that was so flea infested that I get queasy thinking about it.I went to the vets and had her checked out and they told me it was safe to put Frontline plus for dogs under 22 pounds.I did. And, 48 hours later a big difference.I think people forget that fleas will still pop up on the dog but they don't last. It take 24 hours for the fleas to die. Also it acts like flea birth control that helps cut down on a flea infestation.Also, my vet reminded me, it is important to remember no bath 2 days prior to applying Frontline and 2 days after to bath time. Also if you don't use a mild doggie shampoo the product will not last as long. A more harsher not made for dogs shampoo will strip the product off the dog.I hate putting chemicals on my dogs and I know one of my dog reacts every time I put it on but she hasn't had any sort of visible skin reaction. So, I continue to use this product. It is important to remember it only works for 30 days. I always put it on the first garbage day of the month. :)I highly recommend this product."
My son got this for his 1st birthday and is now almost 3 and still plays with it.
Vey good price for a very good product.Very fast delivery.
"I bought these for my 14 month old daughter. She loves baths and loves toys. These turtles are cute but they all float upside down for some reason. I think that makes them less enticing for her because the cute, playful part of them is hidden when they are upside down."
"This is rediculous!! You packed a 0.5 oz tube of eye cream loose in the same box with 27 lbs of cat food! You did not bubble-wrap the eye cream, you did not place it in a protective box, you did not do anything to protect a small tube of eye cream from 4 heavy bags and 48 cans of cat food! The tube was flattened; it was the most expensive single item in the box. If I could give you zero stars, I would."
"My family and I are avid Scrabble players and looked forward to trying the new Super Scrabbble edition. We were, however, sorely disappointed. The only thing ""super"" about it is that it is super-long. While it was a great idea to add more letters, higher points per word and a larger board, the end product seemed an inferior edition, hastily manufactured and largely untested.The manufacturer simply added a border to the existing Scrabble game board. The new higher point squares are all near the periphery so it takes some game time to be able to use them. The board itself is flimsy and too large to comfortably swivel as each player takes their turn. It would be better to have it on a turning pedestal similar to the Deluxe edition. There are many more tiles on this board. It would have been nice to have the tile pockets on the board to hold them all in place - again like the Deluxe edition.The score pad is too short for the length of this game and the increased number of tiles should be in a larger bag as the same size bag makes it harder to pass and mix. We tried giving each player nine, instead of the standard seven, tiles but the tile holder is too short for this to be comfortable.In short, we do not recommend this new version. It compares unfavorably to the Deluxe Scrabble edition."
The gel sheets are OK but don't stay on like it says it should. The silicone gel in the tube was more effective.
"My son received this toy as a Christmas gift when he was 2 1/2 months old. He LOVED it right from the beginning! Whenever he would get really fussy, we would play it and he would immediately calm down and just stare at the big eyes of the gloworm. My only complaint is that there is no volume and when we accidently hit it it would start playing pretty loudly and wake him up. But he would smile and close his eyes again."
"My 5 & 9 year old boys love this game and so do I! We enjoy stealing Zeus from each other and seeing how fast we can ""climb"" Mount Olympus. I like that they're hearing and using mythological names and that my oldest works on quick adding and subtracting. My youngest boy needs one of us to add/subtract right now, but he gets to practice recognizing numbers. We love Gamewright games and have previously played Frog Juice, Rat-a-Tat Cat, Hissss, Snap, Feed the Kitty, and Leaping Lizards. This has been one of the boys' favorites because of the ""stealing"" and fast pace."
"I searched Amazon high and low for a moisturizer without toxic ingredients, and since so many manufacturers don't include ingredients on their product descriptions I was unable to make an educated decision. I am hoping to have another baby and recent studies suggest that women who are pregnant, or trying to get pregnant, should avoid retinyl palmitate. I went with Olivella because the bottle said 100% Virgin Olive Oil. I have been using it for the past week, and imagine my surprise when I glanced at the ingredients list to see what they had used to scent the oil (because it doesn't smell like olive oil) and found, among other things, retinyl palmitate! Not exactly 100% virgin olive oil! While there might be a small amount of vitamin A in olive oil, it seems that they have added more (as well as citrus oil, and a number of flower oils that provide its pleasant fragrance). I am sorely disappointed!"
"A very sensual & erotic scent. I have tried Blv many times, but it never spoke to me. This one does. It is dark, mysterious. It's got a bit of a boozy note. Seems to me like drinking champagne in bed. I really enjoy this one. Wears close to the skin and could be worn every day, provided you don't mind people mistaking your perfume for alcoholic drinks. A grower and definitely worth sampling. I like it, but not even to rebuy it."
"Product works well. I have two Golden Retrievers and we all know how much hair that entails. Was pleased with the Furminator, it does make a difference."
"I had high hopes for this, but it smells like cheap soap. And it won't go away. I cannot stand the cheap little girl feel to this attar."
I have purchased many litter carpets this one seems to work the best so far. Litter still some how manaages to make it on to hte floor but in much less quantities.
One problem is the user interface is a little difficult to use. I actually had to read the manual :-(
Leap frog's phonics railroad & train are great! Best when bought new! But still great!
"My 15-year old Yorkie was diagnosed with kidney problems and it was suggested I use Epikitin twice daily...sprinkled on his food. I had no problem with my finicky eater. The powder is tasteless and he never knew it was in his food. He is now 16 and still on it twice a day. My vet says he is a real survivor, but I feel the Epikitin has prolonged my little guy's life as he is now 16 and still going strong."
"Poor Spot, our five-month-old chocolate lab, had more than his share of ticks. We live in the foothills of the Adirondack mountains so there are plenty of ticks to be had and Spot has proven to be a master at retrieving them.Over the course of three weeks he'd had four ticks on him. Who knows if there might have been others hiding under his thick coat that we couldn't find?Since we applied the Advantix we haven't found a single tick on him. We've also found that since he has been tick-free he has been a little less hyper. Some of that is natural development at his age but even when we would remove the ticks manually we noticed that he was easier to get along with.Spot gives this product five stars and so do I."
"I have been using this exact brand (this tube, and everything) for about 8 years with my cats. One loves the flavor, but the other one if iffy and sometimes eats it.Pros:-It's good and sticky, easily staying on a finger for cat to lick off.-Malt-flavor is appealing to most cats (4 out of 5 of mine over the years).-It works well for maintenance/prevention.-It works when the cat starts coughing if given right away.Cons:-Some cats won't like the sticky texture. (But all seem to like the smell!)-It is petroleum-based, which can reduce nutrient absorption if given before or with meals.-Does not currently ship via Amazon Prime.Bottom line"
"This is a great game for parties, other social gatherings and especially apres ski. I used to play Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary a lot. I find myself playing Proverbial Wisdom over and over again with my friends. Because everyone knows the proverbs such as &quot;Two heads are better than one&quot; every team has a good chance to win and that keeps it fun. This game will make a great holiday gift. What's not to like?"
"I love the game, but the product is incredibly cheap. The board is cheap, thin plastic. Only a few chips and no cards are included. Its worth about 25 cents. I should have gotten one of the other Michigan Rummy games. This one is junk."
"Fun to play with kids, fun to play with adults over drinks, great for all ages."
Great Replica from one of my favorite character from the movie Shaun of the Dead!!! a must one for any zombie movie lover!
The game is a lot of fun to play once you get into it. I played it at a camp retreat and we kept playing it for hours!
"I played the original Ticket to Ride game and rally enjoyed it.Got this ""Europe"" edition game for my birthday.It has a few extra rules over the original game, but still really fun.If you never played this game before, get the original ""US"" version.One negative aspect is that only max of 5 players can play."
"I took this for 6 months, twice a day. I THINK it worked. At 7 months, I suddenly realized that my hair was shiny and thick, like it was when I was 20 (I'm 40 now). Given that long of a period, it's so hard to know the exact cause. COULD it have been the Viviscal? Yes. But could it be due to the extra biotin I take or my raw food diet? Yes, it could. Either way, I'm going to take it for another two months because IF it's the thing helping, I like the change."
"Although technically not 'self-cleaning' (Oh How I Wish ...) this litter box does make scooping-poop a breeze. In fact, you don't have to scoop at all! All you do is 1/2 fill the box with litter (avoid wheat clumping unless you want a goopy mess)wait for kitty to poop and pee and roll box over 2 turns. All the ""mess"" (literally) fills the drawer cavity. Then slide drawer out and ""dump"" (no pun intended). Now that's innovation."
"I was not expecting that this dog brush would be so amazing - and considering that they sell this for $50 at our local big box - I could not have been more happy with the price.Great for ANY kind of dog - used it on my pit and lab - and my friend's have used it on their malamute, terrier, and cattle dogs.Awesome product!!"
"I bought this toy in hopes that it would keep my 8 month old entertained in his crib in the mornings when he was awake before us. It is a really fun toy but difficult to see it when he is laying down. He ends up trying to turn sideways in the crib to lay beside it which he has now gotten too long for and kicks the crib rails when he gets excited. We both love the lights and music it makes, they are really cute! We try to use it for tummy time too but it doesnt last very long, he hates being on his tummy. It has worked better than any other toy we try to use for tummy time. Overall I think it is a really great toy!"
My son and I are tired of tring to buy this damn toy. I feel if you make these toys you should make alot of them. So parents like me dont get mad. If you plan to make toys be Santa Claus and make enough for everyone!
"It looks really cool, but the horns will fall off every once in a while (I glued mine on). The box says the ""helio arms"" add power, but they dont do anything for it, and. I customized mine so it had more power."
I owned a similar HAI Iron (which I bought for $99) for over four years (and was still performing quite well) until that fateful morning when it fell from the bathroom counter to the tile floor of my bathroom while I was doing my hair. The HAI Iron that I recently bought to replace (paid around $69) is not exactly like the one I previously owned but function and performance is comparable. I also have no issues with the one I recently bought and I'm pretty satisfied with it.
"I did my research and read all the reviews on Fisher Price's InteracTV. I did take pause when I read a number of reviews that complained about compatability issues and such, but I figured that there was always some idiot out there who didn't follow the directions! So when amazon ran a special on the system, I grabbed one. Then I spent 30 minutes trying to make the darn thing work! I read the directions, looked up the code for my dvd unit and proceeding with the setup, which seemed quite elementary. Elementary that is until the code didn't work. Never worry, Fisher Price listed a solution to this problem; unfortunately that didn't work either, and Fisher Price has the nerve to let their employees have Saturday off - so no help from customer service! Next I tried our second dvd player, and the code took the first time, but the test card would not work. The player kept reading different screens from the ones that I placed in it, and I grew increasing frustrated. Eventually I got through the setup process. I tried the included disc to see if my soon to be three year old son would enjoy it. He has only recently started to show an interest in watching tv, loves pushing buttons (what toddler doesn't!), and I thought this would be a great game for him to play that let him see shows while interacting with them, not just sitting there like a couch potato. Well, it starts out like a tv episode, then the screen freezes (which would probably set my son off), and a picture of the controller appears with the main character asking a question for the child to answer with the controller. On the episode that I played, Elmo was very hard to understand. When I answered incorrectly, I was startled that Elmo said something to the effect of ""NO - that's not what Elmo was thinking about"", in a somewhat abrupt tone. When I tried to answer differently, I had to wait for Elmo to finish with his speech before it would even recognize my answer. So the kid could answer correctly, but never know it because Elmo is still telling him that he is wrong from before. I was incrediably disappointed by the slowness of the unit, and its lack of responsiveness. I rried one more question and gave up before I died from boredom. This toy would not pass muster with my son, and would likely be thrown in record time. I repackaged the thing (no small task mind you), and took it back to the store (amazon was sold out when I placed my order), where the customer service lady was not at all surprised to have it returned. Don't waste your money or time on this disappointment from Fisher Price."
"I have a litter locker for both of my litterboxes (1 on each floor) and am glad I do. Does a fantastic job of locking away the odor, and each refill lasts about a month for the most popular box, several months for the other (3 cats). Worth it, in my book!"
"I have been using this product for 3 months now, and it cleared my dog's (Maltese) eye up tremendously. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone who has dogs with ongoing tear stain issues....It really does work!"
"Great product! Does what it claimed to do. Would totally recommend it, especially for galswith long hair. Thanks for providing such a good product for the price!!!"
"The product was very light, as it indicated on the package. My style held longer than usual, apparently due to the Aussie Gel. I liked the smell, which was fresh and not overly strong. I liked that this product didn't make my hair stiff or sticky. I couldn't really tell that I'd put it on my hair, except that my style held up longer. I'd recommend it to my family and friends."
"I got this pen at a disount store with the promise that it would be able to take handwriting and digitize it to Microsoft word. It totally did that for me. So originally I was going to get this for my son, but I have now absconded with it and it has become a great tool for me to use. If your child has GREAT handwriting or is college bound with a need to take notes on the fly this thing is awesome. If your child doesn't print well, or is not acadamia bound, maybe you want to invest in something different. Overall I loved the first incarnation of the fly pen (which my kids still use!) and I really like the features on this pen too. It is not as user friendly as the first one, but for those of us that had to learn palm stylus language and use multiple commands on an old TI-86 scientific calculator, this thing is a breeze. I was really shocked how many bad reviews there were on this."
"I didn't know the fragance of this perfume but my girlfriend wanted it. She was so happy with the gift, and I learned it smells really nice."
"This clown is really cute. Purchased for my 3 year old for Christmas. I love that it is all wood and is more challenging than the stacking rings. Whoever designed it did a great job. It was expensive but I think this will last for a long time, unlike the throwaway plastic toys from China. I wish all toys were this nice and without flashing lights and sounds. Very satisfied!"
"I purchased the medium for my male min pin since it mentions order the next size up if you have a male. The diaper covers everything and has enough velcro to make it fit snug around his waist, but the rest of the diaper is really bulky in the back. I'm hoping to get him completely potty trained soon so he doesn't have to wear it, but it's doing it's job so far."
"Big Bertha's little sister definitely has the bulky lines of the family, however the overall package is smaller. The Baby Bertha is just as nice a kit as the Big Bertha, but a cottage industry has sprung up around the baby. Excelsior Rocketry has come up with several ""Goony"" decal sets that allow you to turn the rather drab Baby Bertha into one of several inspired designs, most of which are based on old Estes classics. To date, I've built two, the Goony Max and the Goonybird Zero, based on the Excelsior decal sets, and two others that were direct clones of old Estes products, the Star Snoop and the Zoom Broom. Buy 'em by the bunch!"
I got these for some neighborhood cats that have been left behind when people moved. I would recommend a pill gun if your not accustomed to giving a cat pills (due to the larger size of the pill). But I was able to get them into 3 different cats with only one small scratch. The price was great compared to other medications.
"This perfume has been around for years, and it apparently will always be a favourite among women (and men)...the person this was bought for, loved it."
"I cannot recommend this product enough!My daughter has had this system for about two years now. She has several cartridges and still plays with it frequently. It is our favorite toy for long car rides, because...* You can use HEADPHONES with it! (All the Moms say, ""Yes!"") BTW, this is true for all the LeapFrog products I have found so far!* It doesn't have a bunch of loose parts (the pen is well-attached, and extra cartidges can be kept in the carrying case, if you get one -- which I recommend).* They can play with it for hours and not mind that they're learning things!* Far better than an X-Box or other ""violent-video-game"" system -- ALL the games are ""G-rated"" AND educational.* Both boys and girls can play AND enjoy these games.All LeapFrog products (Leapster, LeapPad, etc.) are VERY well-rated for age and educational level. Be sure to pay attention to the age recommendations, and don't waste your time or frustrate you child by pushing them too far ahead with this system. I do NOT recommend it for very slow 4-year-olds or younger children, NOR do I recommend it for very young children who do not understand how to treat expensive toys with SOME respect (although ours has withstood quite a bit of abuse from both child AND her klutzy Mom &lt;g>!). Contrary to appearances, the optional carrying case is good for keeping the game from damage, as well as keeping the games together.The ""L-Max"" system costs a little more, but has some features you might be interested in. If you opt NOT to get it, rest assured that the ""L-Max"" games ARE supposed to work with the regular ""Leapster"" system, minus a couple of abilities that the TV-compatible L-Max System uses, and that your child supposedly won't notice.If you can afford it, I recommend the optional recharging unit, as rechargable batteries don't tend to last long in the Leapster (they lose their charge if left standing, even when a device is off). If you go with store-bought batteries, the ones for electronic devices are worth the extra cost, as they really DO last longer (Energizer ""e"" batteries seem to last the longest for us.) If you go with batteries, be sure to keep an extra set on hand for those ""Hey!-I-was-in-the-middle-of-a-game!"" moments!"

"Just got this as a gift from someone who loves it. It is so strong, perfumy, like you are drenched in fragrance. I'm not surprised people get complimented because there is no question you are wearing perfume!"
My nephew loved this product. He said it was one of the best presents he had ever gotten on Christmas. Easy to build and u can use it after u build it too...shoots real cannon balls. His name is Logan and he just turned 8. Excellent product & review.
"We have a long-haired chihuahua who is very curious about the outside world during car rides. He used to run back and forth between the driver's lap and the passenger seat, trying to get a peak out the window. His favorite was using the driver's left leg as a booster to look out the window. He whined the first two car rides for a little bit but settled down quickly and now jumps into the car seat as soon as we put him in the car. We also put a few seat cushions under the seat to boost it up a little higher and put a blanket in the seat so he's got more height and warmth. This is a great car seat for a reasonable price. Car rides are now much safer for the doggie and the driver."
"This is great for those wanting a clean litter box but who don't like to scoop the poop by hand. The problem is that one side clip is very difficult to shut, and some clean litter always gets on the floor when I turn the box over. Still worth it though."
"Needed to get a new larger crate for my puppy who outgrew the one we bought at the Pet Superstore/s.This one is hands down 100% better. Very roomy for my puppy, both in height and width (bigger than the ones at the stores).Best thing about the crate is it's ability to be broken down and stored in less than 2 minutes!Thanks again to Amazon and Midwest - great product w/ super fast delivery!"
"sent me the wrong item, TWICE, even after returning the item once at my cost, WITH A PICTURE OF THE RIGHT ITEM. Won't use them again, and don't recommend for this reason."
"I don't remeber when I first played the game, but it's my favorite! It keeps everyone entertained and if you play your cards right you can figure out someone's cards without looking at them. I even bought the PC version. Though it is difficult to get anyone in my family or my friends to play, once we do start they never wanna stop! It is easy to loose the pieces though, so be careful. If you listen very hard, and aren't watching 'Clue the Movie' at the same time as I do, you can pick up hints. If you like mystery games you will LOVE this one!"
"I like this product - it is a long lasting, woodsy scent. I was looking for it and I checked Macy's. The salesperson there was quite polite and let me know they didn't stock it, and suggested an alternative. A quick web search that evening revealed that this scent is stocked at Walgreen's. Not your typical Macy's fare. I'm appreciative that the clerk was polite.Unable to find a place to try this scent, I decided to purchase from Amazon.I was hoping that it would smell of fresh cigars, but it does not. It does, however, smell of woodsy herbs and it's a very pleasant scent."
"I heard the inventor on a local radio station one day Talking about her Boston terrier who tore up all his toys and she said that's why she invented this. I was a little unsure that this would keep my little # 3 BT busy, but it does. It also keeps #2 BT busy, but #1 BT just wants you to shake the treats out. The only problem I have is finding treats small enough to work in it. Sometimes I just put their dog food in it and they still love to play with it. I definitely would recommend this dog toy to anyone who very active dogs it does keep them busy."
"And great free shipping.Costs about as much as regualr cat litter.It does get all over, even with the dome.Keep a dust eater/dirt devil small portable vacuum nearby."
"I bought this for my granddaughter who is in second grade. She has found the game fun, but quite challenging and occasionally frustrating at times. It has multiplication in it, which surprised me, as I did not think they did that in 2nd grade! Also, the game has prefixes and suffixes; also something I did not think they got to at this grade level. However, she IS learning,and generally having a good time doing so, and that is why I choose Leapster products!"
"Our dogs simply love these. They can even double as pill pockets if the pill isn't too big. I have never found a good replacement for them since moving away from the PetCo that carried them, which is why I'm not ordering them off of Amazon. It would be easier to pick up a different treat when we go grocery shopping, but they ALL have high fructcose corn syrup listed as the first couple of ingredients. Here are the Bil Jac ingredients:Chicken Liver, Chicken, Chicken By-Product Meal, Wheat Flour, Glycerin, Propylene Glycol, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Potassium Sorbate and Citric Acid and BHA and Calcium Propionate (Preservatives), Iron Oxide.Notice the first three ingredients are all CHICKEN."
"I found the item to be well made and easy to use. It was a clever idea and my grandson enjoyed it a lot. Using Amazon was also a plus, no crowds to contend with."
These are by far the best sleeping mask I have ever used. I work weird hours and travel allot and can't live without them. Just ordered another pair since I stupidly left them on the plane yesterday. Won't do that again.
"My cats(2) love to eat grass, not the grow your own type wheat grass but lawn grass. we have to pot it in the fall & try to keep it growing all winter. Since we have been giving them Grass Gel they are not eating the fresh grass so much. They like the gel a lot and don't try to shake it off like the other stuff we have given them.If this stuff help with the hair balls we will be ordering lots more.THANKS & MY CATS THANK YOU"
"This is an awesome toy! It keeps my 4 yr old son occupied for long periods of time. The only negative, which others have mentioned is the screaming monkey sound. But if your kid is smart enough to play the games, he or she is smart enough to turn the volume down. The first time he used it I showed him how, and now he knows that is the first thing he does when he wants to play with it...problem solved!"
"I purchased this toy for my dog after he played with one similiar to this on vacation with my dad's dog. He absolutely loves this toy. He plays with the pieces separately and together (my husband and I help with the together). He's pretty rough on all of his toys, but these have stayed together well. No holes, no missing tails. Great product."
We have 3 dogs and one is a pit bull/dalmation mix. She gallops through this door with no problems. It is strong and keeps the north wind out. Would buy this again if ever needed.
"I got one of these as a gift for a friend's child, and was so impressed with it that I had to get one for my son. I love the music that it plays, and I like the fact that you can set it to teach numbers OR shapes. My son loves to watch the lights."
"I'm an esthetician (skin care therapist) for over twenty, and I'm still to find something better than these products, it does not exist. Yes, I know it's a bit expensive, but when you see the results you'll know what I'm talking about, also, this is to be used with another product, and that is the hydration 5 b, and you can purchase them together in a kit."
"THIS IS THE BEST PEEL OFF MASK,THAT HAVE EVER USED, I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY, I USE IT WEEKLY AND MY FACE IS BABY SOFT."
"This game has false ""facts"" in which the game states are true. My Husband (who was born & raised in Finland, actually next to the city of Nokia) was laughing hysterically when the game used as a fact that the word Nokia means a small fury animal/weasel. I'm not sure where the company that made this game got it's facts from, but Nokia doesn't actually mean anything since it's the name of a city (The city does however have a coat of arms with a weasel in it...Maybe it got it's info from there?). Anyways, I only bring this up since if you're looking for an educational game that actually has true facts in it, look elsewhere since you can't really trust this game.Other then that though, it is fun to play."
"I have struggled all my life with weak, splitting nails. I've had acrylics for many years but tired of the maintenance. My nail tech introduced me to Rejuvacote about 2 months ago and I am amazed at my natural nails today. They are longer than they have been in decades, and strong and resilient! ""This is the best nail strengthener I have ever seen,"" said my nail tech. She was right!"
"After trying out about 12 different ones, I came across John Varvatos Vintage. I haven't known that name if it was 2 weeks ago, before I bought a John Varvatos buttoned down shirt, which is also beautiful and very comfortable. Anyway, I had to cool down a bit to smell it over again and again before making a decision, but now, after coming home and trying it out for awhile, I can say I'm mucho mucho satisfied. Everyone seems to like it, including myself. Moreover, I got it at a bargain price of 33$, thanks to a special deal in a local drugstore chain combined with Mastercard.What I used before was Davidof's Adventure and Carolina Herara's 212 for men. I liked them ok i guess, but never was I so enthusiastic as I am with this one."
"Super easy set up. Nice heavy, durable mesh all around the unit. Sizing accurate. My greyhound hopped right in and went to sleep! When I adopt another grey I'll definitely get another of these."
My hair is fried from using this hair dryer. Burnt hair. I've been using this for almost a year. I THOUGHT my fried hair was due to the curling iron I was using so I stopped using that about a month ago. My hair still is getting fried thanks to this catastrophe of a machine. DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT IF YOU LIKE YOUR HAIR!
"Hot Shot is a bit of a personal fave. He reminds me greatly of when I was younger and would play with my older cousins' Transformers. Hot Shot is pretty durable and somewhat poseable. As far as his Powerlinx combos go, I didn't really care for either of them, but then again I was more interested in the figure itself, not the Powerlinx combos. Overall, he's a good buy for your collection or child."
"Based on a suggestion from a customer's review, I bought the product to be used in helping to hold up thigh high compression stockings. It did not work for me!Maybe it can be used for something with less pull/tension.At the moment I have no idea what I can use the product for; maybe my daughters will be able to think of something for themselves, being nearly 70 years old I can't envision needing it for anything!It might be ok for decollete use!"
"I started using this product when I just did not want to spend another 45.00 for my usual Origins face cream. I was skeptical at first but when I found out that it not only has Vitamin C but White Tea too, I was willing to give it a shot. Both are wonderful topical antioxidants and even Origins could not offer both in one product.That was over a year ago and I have not gone back. In fact, I use the entire line of Avalon Vitamin C now. The cleansing milk, facial serum, balancing toner and this cream. My skin absolutely glows like never before, my dry-as-the-desert skin problem is resolved, I never have breakouts and I look forward to my regimen every night and morning.Oh! The scent of this product is great. It is a clean citrus smell that does not linger too long - just perfect for feeling refreshed.Great stuff."
"escape is not a new fragrance, but it's still a magnificent one."
"The product is very effective. My dog looked horrible for 2 years and I tried many products. She is a creme colored shih tzu, but her eyes used to resemble a racoon. This product works for me. My suggestions---Start with a fine-toothed comb to remove the residue. Use scissors to trim the stained fur. Apply the liquid with a cosmetic pad to clean the area. Dab with the powder. I started with this process every day for about 3 weeks. Then I reduced it to 2 times a week for about 3 months. Now I just use it once a week for prevention and I am thrilled with the results. Some tips---Their non-woven application pads are unnecessarily expensive. You can find these at a drugstore(do NOT use cotton balls as they do not work). Keep the fur short in this area by trimming every several weeks. The trimming removes the unsightly fur in the beginning but also keeps the area drier and prevents future staining. Now that I am on the once a week cycle, occassionally I will comb out some minor residue mid-week. I initially bought the starter kits but found that the 1/2oz powder lasts longer the 2oz liquid. In my experience, the 4oz liquid matched with the 1/2oz powder is the optimal buying combination."
"I ordered one of these last year and it worked well until the stopper strap broke and then lost the stopper, so I got a stopper at the hardware store and kept on using it. I liked the design enough, and after losing the replacement stopper, that I decided to try replacing it.I ordered another one a couple of weeks ago and, when it arrived, the plastic strap holding the stopper cap was already broken. So I sent it back for a replacement, which was prompt in arriving. This one was not only was broken when it arrived but the stopper cap was missing completely - which is why I had ordered another one in the first place.At this point, I decided to stick with the original unit and keep a small stock of cork or rubber stoppers handy.The notable flaws in the design are; the plastic used for the cap/stopper assembly is inappropriate (will not handle the requisite flexing to operate the stopper) and the plastic strap for the stopper sticks out from the flat side of the canteen so one has to carry it with the bowl against the body, so one has the choice of getting wet from the bowl or having the plastic strap edge poking you. After the stopper broke off I trimmed back the leftover plastic on the cap to allow me to carry it with the canteen against my body which is much more comfortable.It's a nice idea, but the design is flawed and the quality control is poor, Amazon should at least look a the products it sells prior to delivery to ensure it is in operational form/has all the parts."
"I love this game, I had searched and searched at stores nearby and none ever had it in stock. At Christmas time I wanted to purchase this game for my family and found it through Amazon and at a fair price. My family loves this game, its actually one of my favorites and I remember playing it with my family growing up too. Glad I found it at Amazon."
"I use this in two cars. I have a 4-door Mazda 6 and my girlfriend's got a 4-door Chevy Cavalier. Luckily I bought this promptly after adopting a rescue dog because turns out she wasn't too used to being in a car and threw up. This seat cover worked great. It kept the mess off the seats and was easily cleaned. The fit of the seat cover, surprisingly, fits better in my car than my girlfriends but I think this is because I have rear headrests and she doesn't. To secure it in her car we tilt the seat forward (such as to gain trunk access) and put the straps behind the corner of the seat then set it back in place.The seat cover has a lot of versatility. It adapts well and easily between my car and my girlfriend's and covers the whole seat. We've been using it for 5 months now and it has doubled as a barrier keeping the hair off of the seats too (a plus when you want to take the cover out and not have to vacuum before having passengers). It also keeps dirty paws from getting on the interior, and to clean it just take it out and shake and you're good to go (unless there was throw up, then a washing machine comes in handy).Generally with my reviews, I apply a Zagat-style rating to it. That is, what were my expectations and how much did the product meet them. In light of this, I give it 5 stars because it met my expectations spot on and I am considering purchasing a second. I recommend this for a car-sick prone dog (or cat?) or any dog that may shed a lot, but also it's great for keeping the dirt from their paws from getting on the interior."
i think undermine is great he reminds me of cruelock from energon and kindof like the geno breaker from zoids with the hornblade accessory and he has very nice shades of green and i like the mace tail all in all an A+ toy
I can't find this product in town anymore which means I have to order it online. Took a little longer than I expected to get it but finally did and was so happy. Thanks. Product looked as if it was brand new.
"The games included in this device appear to be the same or very similar to the thomas the tank engine leapster game, minus the huge price tag (~$80 for leapster, ~$25 for game, plus more for ac charger). The graphics are coarse and primitive, but that is the case with the leapster and v.tech games as well.This tv game runs off of 4 AA batteries, so you might want to get rechargeable ones. Also, if you have a portable or in-car tv, you can hook this game system up to it so your child can play it in the car like a leapster, although it may require buying a cheap RCA adapter from radio shack or walmart or somewhere.The games are a little difficult for younger children (3 to 4), and our little one did get a little frustrated at first trying to make turns. But you can pretty much just drive the train randomly around and still play the game.Right now there are really no console games (wii, playstation, xbox) out there for 3-4 year olds. The leapster/v.smile systems cost hundreds of dollars when you add it up, and are expensive and fragile. So compared to that, this game system is a good buy, and our little one loves it. And hey, there's no lead paint. Bonus."
"This fountain does exactly what it says it will. I ordered the Drinkwell fountain at the same time as the Petmate fountain. I foster cats/kittens and wanted to see if either was better. I believe they are comparable. The Petmate one has removable backup reservoir (hold more slightly more water), where the Drinkwell has a built-in area that holds a bit of extra water (easier to clean). The Drinkwell creates the water flowing sound, where the Petmate is virtually silent. Cats preferences are individual, some like the sound, some don't. I'm happy with the fountain."
"The description didn't mention the use of static as a correction technique, but I guess that was my fault for not asking. I didn't want a shock collar. It was a bit dirty, but otherwise it appears to be working well, the one time I used it."
"Very disappointing. I ordered this item in July 07 - used it maybe 20 or 30 times tops. Went to use it in Dec. 08, it wouldn't turn on. The Reset button on the plug doesn't stay depressed and so it just won't turn on anymore. Good thing they only warranty it for 1 year - a lot of good that does me. Good iron while it lasted I guess. Too much $ for poor quality."
I picked up one of the smaller bottles of this at Whole Foods yesterday because I didn't want to use my organic scented hand creme all over my body. My skin is not a fan of dry weather anymore as I get older and I live in a desert. Bad combination. I've also decided in the last few months that I will no longer be using things that have petroleum and parabens. Alba does not use either one in this lotion. The lotion soaked in quickly and even after the first use I could feel a difference. 24 hours after purchasing it the cracked spot on one of my knuckles is starting to heal and does not feel like sand paper. I will without a doubt be getting the 32oz bottle.
oh i'm just silly on the titlebut seriously all my girlfriends love(d) it
"It definitely dries the hair faster, but it's still significantly frizzy afterwards. Don't know how I could be doing anything wrong - it only has 2 settings & I've been blowdrying my hair for 20+ years. Not worth the money."
"A co-worker recommended this to me after listening to complaints about how hard it is to deal with my daughters' hair. He purchased this for me at an Asian store in which he travelled about 2 hours to get to. When they no longer carried it, I frantically searched the web to find it. It was difficult because the only part of the title that matches the bottle is "" Shiseido and Naoshi Essence"" the rest is mostly in japanese. I was ecstatic to have finally found it here. It was about $9 cheaper at the store and there was also a refill bottle available. Still I was excited to find it again.As the other reviewers have mentioned the smell is awesome. It is reminiscent of fresh linen or laundry detergent (not as potent). It has a ""clean"" scent, like you just stepped out of the shower. I know that smell is in the ""nose"" of the beholder, yet I have received several compliments on the smell in both my daughters' hair and mine.My daughters' have very thick and long hair. It can be very difficult to maintain. I have tried a number of detanglers with my primary complaint always remaining the same"
"I just got my Sectional Pelican Clips, By Soft Touch. I love these there allot easier to Use then the aluminum ones that I had used before. I have Shoulder Length Hair that is very, very thick. I often do Vintage inspired Hair Styles. or if I am Lazy I just Curl them. these Clips do not get caught in my hair, nor does it pull my hair. what is very Nice I like how easy it is to grip my hair. high Quality of the plastic so it helps treat my hair not damage my hair. haven't been able to clean them yet, but I am sure I will be able to clean them easier also!!! Amazon you are amazing thank you again. I am sure I will order from you again. your Shipping and Packaging is always over the top Like always. I for sure will be a return customer... your Shipping is always allot earlier then you say it will be but that's fine I am not complainingxoxo,Sara-"
"At first, I liked this crate because it was a bit cheaper than the same-size one at local pet stores.The fact it has a second door was just a second thought that I didn't think would make much difference.But, after getting another dog and thus another crate, one with only one door, the second door has proved invaluable in our setup, allowing us to put this one horizontal against a wall and still allow entry/exit with side door.Love it, and our four legged friend does too!"
"I ordered this, relying on the caption which says that it's eau de toilette spray, but it's not scent, it's deodorant. This was some months ago, and the company still has this ad for this product up, but have not indicated that it's not scent, but a deodorant spray. To their credit, they emailed me and told me of the discrepancy, and I chose to accept the product, anyway. But they should have removed or updated it by now."
"This stuff doesn't really work. I smeared it in my face-craters overnight, and in the morning it just left my peeling, cragged face unearthly, radioactive tones of red. Well, luckily I have to use the reflective parts of my anime DVDs to see myself until mom puts another mirror in the bathroom. (I broke the last one doing Naruto moves)"
This product was not in stock and dealer would not confirm it was not in stock but kept my charge for Angels eyes tear remover untill I contacted Amazon for refund. Do not deal with this vender.
"I like the curler as it heats up very quickly and curls my hair nicely. The only problem is the switch! I do not get why they made the switch so flimsy and put the on/off switch together that you can easily press it off without knowing. Every time I curled my hair, I would accidentally turn it off and then have to set the degree level again annoying! Besides that still a good curler."
"This is such a cute toy! The operating of it is simple and the sound quality isn't bad for how small it is, especially if it's at a lower volume. My daughter finds this a fun toy to tinker with and seeing as she's gone from the house so often, she's happy to have something small that will play her music without her having to wear headphones. For the price, it's very much worth what it's got as features."
"So I have been trouble gettin heat to the back of my limo. Then I sprayed Mambo all over my petcock and BAM, started working great.You can also use Mambo to clean up vomit that supermodels spew all over the limo from smelling it.I say A+!!Ronnie."
"My cat didn't like any catnip until Cosmic. My sister had recommended it and she has 4 cats and would know. Well, I'll tell ya, he went nuts when I rubbed some btwn. my fingers, as suggested, and dropped it on the floor! He eats a few bites and within 10 min. is ready for a nap! It's funny. This is now how I knock him out if he's bored or a bit stressed over another cat in the yard. Works like a charm. He's a Turkish Van cat and a mellow fellow anyway. The quantity is good for the money too.Cosmic Pet 2-2/3-Ounce Cup Catnip"
ITEM ARRIVED QUICKER THAN I EXPECTED. EXCELLENT PRICE AND PRODUCT. I HAVE BOUGHT THIS ITEM IN STORES IN THE PAST BUT WILL BE ALWAYS BE PURCHASING ON AMAZON
I usually bought this one from my vet and it was $28(CAD)!!!It is so cheap cheap here and it works very well with my dog's itchiness!! I would recommend this one anyone worries about their dogs skin. it absolutely helps well!
"My two, four, and six year old use this toy on a daily basis. Other than art supplies and kitchen food, these are the only toys that are never out of our play rotation. They have built towers as tall as themselves (with a little help from their engineer-minded uncle), and now they can build fairly intricate constructions on their own using the tips they learned from adults.The list of things they have made is pretty amazing"
My son just received this toy for his birthday and they do not work at all. And when he went to push some of the buttons on this phone - they literally fell inside the phone. I packaged them up and they are going back tonight - thank goodness for gift receipts!!
"My son was very surprised and happy to get the original looking Nick Fury action figure (as opposed to the new Nick Fury from the upcoming movie). He likes his action figures to match the old comic books. Unfortunately, there was a slight defect (around where the arm attaches) from the manufacturer, not from the store. Yet, still, he thinks that the toy is great and hopes that Marvel continues to make more Marvel Legends action figures,especially the original Nick Fury."
"Bought this for me wife, although this ""Scent"" has been around a long time..It is wonderful..She get numerous comments about it, and people say they never heard of it...As long as we continue to find it on Amazon...I will continue to buy it for her, it REALLY DOES SMELL THAT GOOD.."
"I love perfume and this is definitely a favorite.It smells...delicious. It doesn't smell fake, it smells like something you want to EAT. I suppose that is where the name comes from. The packaging is pretty and the presentation is really girly in a grown up girl kinda way.It goes on bright and clean, with a bit of sparkle to it, like sugar cookies with pink sugar! It's well named! It stays true, but softens down so it is more subtle sunny/oriental/floral. I've got several compliments on it."
"It's always hard to figure out what to buy a 4-month old, but this Skwish has been a big hit with our daughter. The stretchy ropes help her practice her grabbing skills and the bright colors always get her attention when I show her the toy. A wonderful, wooden toy!"
"I just gave my dog this toy she loved it b/c it sang a long weird song. However, after four ""deedle le dee"" songs it went dead and doesn't work. My dog dumped it on the side and is very disinterested in it now. My only option is to pay for a return ship. What a waste of money."
"I received Armani Mania as a Christmas gift last year and fell in love. I wore it to an interview and was told how delicious it smelled. It's best spritzed and then walked into as it comes on a little strong at first. It's staying power is not to be matched however. Very clean and fresh, with a slight musk undertone."
"I discovered Kid Knex last year as a Pre-K teacher looking for something different for my classroom as the children were getting bored.I have since given this as a gift to nieces and nephews and recently Footed Friends to my friend's son for his sixth Birthday. Not only does he love it but his four year old brother and 3 year old sister do, too. They all play with it. Their mother agrees with me that it is so educational- it involves problem solving, creative thinking skills and fine motor skills.I have just begun furnishing my own Pre-K Program and I added three more sets to the two I already have. I highly recommend this durable, affordable, fun and educational toy."
My son got this toy when he was 4 months old and he loves it. He was very captivated by the spinning animals and the lights. He can also grab on to it which makes him happy. My 3 year old daughter picked it out for him and it was a great selection; one that has encouraged him to roll over from back to belly when trying to reach for it.
"I recently, with skepticism I must admit, ordered the PetSafe Pawz Away Instant Pet Barrier for my grandson's pit bull-bull mastif mix who is currently 8 months old and weighs in at approximately 80 pounds. This ""puppy"" loves to sit on our furniture and, despite several weeks of training, he was winning the battle.When we received our Pet Barrier, we immediately set it up and gave it a try. At first he didn't know what was happening when he felt the shock but quickly learned where he could go and where the ""forbidden"" boundry is. After about a week of wearing the collar when in the living room, he now adheres to the boundry without wearing the collar. When he does try to test it, we put the collar back on him as a reminder and that's all he needs. He has one chair that he's allowed to lay in and he seems perfectly happy with that.I would recommend this product highly to anyone wanting to set barriers for their dog."
"This Jack Sparrow is so great! It really favors him and it's very big and durable. When it first arrived, it didn't talk. It took a while for me to find where the batteries were hidden and the on/off switch - instructions would have been nice to have in the package. A new set of batteries made the difference. It's motion sensitive and is really a lot of fun."
I bought this for my cat because I really hated scooping his litter and risking it crumbling in the litter itself. I LOVE this! It is self explanatory to put together and use- roll it to the side and make sure the clumps get into the tray and dump! :)
I recently bought my Hot tools curler and i love it alot!!! I can set the heat setting to the temperature that i want and it all depends on i want my hair to be curly. Great tool if you are looking for to create those loose curls.
"This is the best toy you will ever give your dog. My friend got it for my little man's birthday and it has provided hours of entertainment. I yell out ""Where is your squirrel baby!"" and my dog runs to get the tree truck so I can hide the squirrels. Good times to be had by all."
"I had to review this product after seeing how one person posted the pics of the crate being torn open by their puppy.First of all, I have the larger version of this crate and throughout all the years of owning and handling dogs, and all the various pens and crates, this one is one of my all time favorites!I bought mine for traveling to dog shows with my Dobe. It is way lighter than hauling around a wire pen and it folds down flat and easy to carry. I love the ventilation it offers and the ease of opening the top, etc.OBVIOUSLY...........this pen is NOT designed for any dog that is somewhat destructive...such as puppies...DUH! So for anyone dumb enough to assume so, then they deserve what they get! This pen also wouldn't be easy for a puppy in the sense that there is no easy way to clean it, such as a removable pan, etc. So if your puppy messed his pen you would have to crawl in there and clean it rather than pull the pan out. Another common sense thing you can foresee.I am rating this product with 5 stars. It is VERY well made. I do agree that the materials have an odor. I have had mine for years now, and it still has somewhat of an odor.I love the weight and ease of moving it and setting it up and down. I would highly recommend this product to any responsible *intelligent* dog owner."
"I have a 7 month old schnoodle. He's only 10 lbs but while he's been teething he's been capable of destroying everything! He was initially very careful with this dragon. He would creep up to it and lick its tongue.. then run away when we squeezed it and the tongue flipped out.. after some introduction, he was all over this thing. Absolutely loved it. 1 day later we looked at the poor dragon and his tongue was missing! and one of his toes were gone too... :( I thought it would be more durable then it was.. I'm sure our puppy ended up eating these missing rubber parts despite our careful supervision. Also, we were concerned about the make/ coloring of the dragon. This was made in China? is there a possibility of lead in the coloring? (flashback; all the toy recalls in china).. Our puppy never got sick or anything, just our paranoid thoughts. anyway, though our puppy loved it, this is why I gave it only 3 stars."
"Memoir '44 fits into the ""war games"" genre of board games. The game pits the Allied forces against Germany in a series of battles that take place in France during 1944. Each scenario includes an historical background of the battle at hand, instructions on how to set up the board, and the victory conditions. The double-sided board accommodates battles on the beach and in the French countryside. Terrain tiles are used to recreate the scene - forests, hills, hedgerows, towns, rivers, bridges, and bunkers all offer strategic advantages in battle. Both sides are allocated a certain number of infantry, artillery, and armor (tanks) in each battle. Each type of unit has its advantages and disadvantages, and players must decide when and where to move these units. Moving units around the board is not a free-for-all. Players are limited by the actions available on command cards in their hands. While eliminating enemy units is the most common way to achieve victory, players can also win by accomplishing strategic objectives such as liberating towns or securing bridges.The best way to play Memoir '44 is to play as one side, then reset the board and play as the other side. You can set up the board and play both sides in about 90 minutes. The base game is designed for two players but can be played with more. With a second copy or a special expansion, up to eight players can take part in epic battles called Overlord scenarios. Additional expansions allow you to fight in eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Pacific. While the base game comes with 16 battle scenarios, additional scenarios are included with each expansion and in a hardcover ""campaign"" book. Plus, the Memoir '44 web site has hundreds of free user-created scenarios.I haven't played Memoir '44 as much as some other games in my collection, but it's easily my favorite war game (and I've played many games of Risk and Axis & Allies)."
This is a great fragrance that is not overbearing and not too sweet. Received many compliments on this and has become my new favortie.
"I bought these scissors to trim around the ears and eyes of my dogs. I would say for the price, the quality is just average, and the sharpness could have been better. I have a pair of the round tip scissors I had gotten at a local drug store for much less to use on people, and I would say the quality is just as good (if not better). These scissors are lightweight, but the opening for the fingers is a bit small, and they don't seem to have any bulk to them...thus feeling flimsy. I will need to sharpen them before I use them again.Regarding the case they came in. It's okay, but I know over time, the snap is going to break off as it doesn't feel like it's great quality either.Overall, they rate to me as just average. I really think you can do just as well buying these type of scissors at a local drug store or discount store (Target, K-Mart, WalMart), or even at a discount beauty supply store for lots less...perhaps saving $5 or more. That's just my opinion. Hope this helped you decide what to do."
"My husband bought this late at night with out checking with me. I told him I didn't think the cats will like it. He set it up anyway. I have no clue if that was easy or hard.The odds are about 2 to 1, I'd say. For every mess or two outside the kitty toilet, we get one in. Now that could be considered a good or bad thing, depending upon how you look at it. Good in that they got their aim right and overcame their fear of the toilet, bad in that if the arm grabber thing didn't get all the poo, the garage is going to smell like baked cat poop. Now this is a scent that is worse than the smelliest skunk. The other problem is that the grinder doesn't always work. So it gets stuck mid-cycle. Then sometimes you've got a watery litter box. I've never known a cat that likes that. So that means more messes on the garage floor. OH and then you've got to take it apart and clean out the grinder thing. Get your gloves and prepare for cat poop soup. This is with the new improved one that they are offering that was supposed to fix this problem. It gets through about 4 or so cycles now before getting stuck, whereas before it got stuck every time. So, I guess that is still improvement.I think this is a brilliant idea. Too bad the cats hate it and it doesn't always work. Maybe someday they'll get it right. If there was a way to make it bigger, so the cats fit it in, and then make it stronger, it might work.Finally convinced my husband to go back to a regular box. I am going to try a biddy cat. Only [...]!"
"This game is fun, requires a good amount of patience and strategy, and, at least to me, is easily comparable to chess. It never really gets old, as the game almost never starts out the same, and everything is open to the management of the player, from setup to attacks. Some players may be put off by the fact that you can't see the rank of your opponents' pieces, but that rule is, like any other, one that can be accepted. 12 dollars is an absolute steal for this game. Highly recommended."
I bought this game for a community 4th of July event. It was an attempt to provide another kid activity. We had tables set up with 4 games monitored by teen volunteers. I thought kids might play with a parent and it actually engaged high school kids. No worry about losing pieces and a low cost low energy option on a hot day.
This Breyer Horse kit is very fun you can make blankets for horses and a halter for this cute little Dapple Grey model. Don't trust the glue tho it stinks go out and buy a fabric glue it will work much better. These model is so cute and from the classic line I think.
"This product does have some kind of defect. I bought my first one and it quit almost exactly six months from purchase. Luckily I kept the warranty info and receipt, and was able to trade it in for a new one at the store of purchase. I wasn't so lucky the second time! This time it quit on me (flickering light, until dead!), after one year. You would think I would get a different straightener, but it does a great job until it goes kaput! So, I bought another one!! We will see how this one fares...third time is the charm, right? Just wanted to warn those that are considering this purchase! $15-20 per year might not be worth it!"
Love this lotion. Great on skin and small to fit in the purse. Great to use all year around!
"I agree with the other reviewer about how it takes decades to pry this toy out of the box, because there can't be fewer than 5000 wires holding it in.Having said that, it was worth it! My daughter got this for her fourth birthday, and she has so much fun working the rides and moving the dolls around. I admit I sometimes play with it after she goes to bed. I love how the rides daisy-chain together, so you can have five different rides working at once. The roller coaster is pretty cool. :-)"
"I keep my Bop-It Extreme in my car - it's a great stress reliever for traffic back-ups or waiting for someone. Kept my 35-year-old friend and his 8-year-old son both entertained for an hour long car trip (both of them going &quot;come on, it's my turn, pass it!&quot;)Several of my other adult friends have found it to be addictive and bought one for themselves based on borrowing mine.Would I play it every single day for an hour? No. But as a break in the hum-drum, and a chance to yell and hit something for fun, I think it's great for all ages!"
"I have long, thick, curly hair and was researching good dryers. I was willing to pay more money if the product was worth it. I read several reviews here of people saying they have tried the T3 and that this dryer is better, so I bought this one for $32. After using it once I am SO happy with it. It dried my hair in about 7 minutes, which is about half the time of my old dryer (which wasn't even a bad dryer to begin with). My hair came out looking so much smoother and more tame, and as a result I spent less time with the flat iron. I have the companion Remington T-studio 2-1/4"" Flat IronRemington S-9400 Tstudio Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Tourmaline 2 1/4"" Wide Plates, and LOVE it just as much. Between the two items (and a little macadamia nut oil) I finish my long, difficult hair in about 15 minutes, and it's smoother than ever, and even holds better in the humidity. It's amazing, I can't see any reason to spend more."
"We purchased this wall-mount food container because our dogs were occasionally ""breaking in"" to the closet where food was stored and over-eating. The dispenser is now mounted on the wall in our garage and we LOVE it. The only issue we had was that the screw holds on the unit itself aren't spaced for stud-mounting, so we had to use a couple of 2x4's to get it mounted so the wall could handle the weight. Beyond that it works great!"
"Great smelling citrus top notes get compliments throughout it's average longevity and projection. Great as a work scent, subtle citrus from beginning to end. A little synthetic smelling but very tolerable, surprised me coming from a lower end designer scent. Doesn't get many compliments due to its average projection and over-spraying just creates a cloying mess."
"I really would like to give this a better rating. The base is really sturdy, the clip holds the dryer tight and the flexible neck lets me use it in differnt positions BUT when I opened the package to assemble the product there were NO SCREWS included to finish assembling it. My husband had to take the whole thing to two different stores to find screws that were small enough to work. Everything was sealed in plastic so they couldn't have been lost, they were just never included. You have to have the screws to assemble the stand and they aren't standard size that you would have on hand at home. Tired of paying for stuff that isn't right. How hard would it be to include two small screws??"
"I am a collector of all things pokemon and i was buying the small pokemon card holders that have 4 slots and 9 slots but this is so much better it has a nice design int the front for pokemon lovers of the original series and its durable, it has a pocket on the front and back of the inner binder. The price is pricey for a binder but i paid for it just because it was the only pokemon binder available on amazon. if you want a pokemon item get it, if you want a place to store your pokemon cards (you need to buy the ultra pro card holders with 3 ring holes seperate) get it."
"My son has tons and tons of fun with the dino box. He stands on it, pushes it across the carpet, opens it up and looks for treasure, even hides in it. However he couldn't understand why, when he first opened it, there were no dinosaurs inside. I had to explain to him that it was just a dino box. He loves it anyways."
"I've been wearing Paco since the late seventies. Through love, hate, death, worn out romances and taxes, I've had it on almost daily for over thirty years. Now, I know what you're thinking.............another dinosaur stuck in the seventies. My take on it is if you really like something, then enjoy it as much as you can. And yeah, I've got some miles on me but I sure do smell good. Buy some and start your own relationship with the best thing to come out of France since Bridget Bardot."
"Out of all the products that I have tried, this provides great styling with shine, nice subtle scent and not too spendy. Lasts long and is not sticky."
"This is a great head-collar leash. It is very simple - no buckles, snaps, clips - just the leash with a hand-loop and a figure-eight loop that goes around the dog's head and snout. Makes walking a dog that pulls much easier and more enjoyable. The only downside is that it is not a very sturdy leash, if the dog gets ahold of it often he will chew through it fairly easily.Overall this leash GREATLY reduced my 70-lb dog's pulling and tugging. He is even more calm when he sees other dogs and squirrels."
"I have two 8 pounds Dachshunds and the Hartz ""Maximum"" Protection Puppy Pads don't stand up to quality in my book. I got up this AM and both pads were wet...one is in a plastic floor protector and the second pad...a just in case pad...is on the hard wood floors. Well, the wet spot was directly in the middle of the pad and when I picked it up, you could feel the moisture on the back of the pad....the pad that is going to give me ""Maximum"" protection....I think not!!!I gave the benefit of the doubt a few weeks ago when I got up and the pad in the plastic floor protector was wet, but it was close to the edge and the floor protector had urine in it...so I had to wipe out the floor protector. As I said, I gave the benefit of the doubt where the wet marks was so close to the edge of the pad. Now this AM...smack dab in the middle of that pad and the underside was moist and you could see the wet mark on the hard wood floors. Not a pool or urine...I'll give them that, but I don't consider what I saw ""maximum protection""....so you make up your own mind.I cancelled my Subscribe and Save on this item. I'll find another puppy pad or go back to my pads that are washable (Pooch Pads)and they are great by the way. I went to the disposable because I had major back surgery and didn't want to have the person helping me out, have to do any washing of puppy pads while I was in the hospital. Well, I got use to not having to wash puppy pads, but after this experience, I'm going back to a higher quality pad or the washable Pooch Pads, which are washable puppy pads. This Hartz Maximum Protection Puppy Pad is disappointing to say the least."
"My adult dog and a friend of mine's adult dog neither one found this ball interesting enough to play with. Would probably be good for a curious puppy. The ""noise"" maker didn't work as well as expected."
"I like the whole series of these toys, however I take a little issue with the fact that they are blocks and the toys says ""car"" etc... I know that they are painted like a car, but I doubt a 1 yr old knows that. I am afraid that she will get confused and think the block is a car. Also all of the objects are shaped like blocks, so a block is being called a car, truck, school bus, pig, baby, etc... (meaning the other barn and house sets, too). I think this could cause some identification problems. I surely hope that Leapfrog tested this being a educational toy company and all. I guess we will all need to work to expose our kids to real cars, pigs, babies, etc.... to make sure that they know they don't look like blocks... Otherwise, these are fun and my daughter likes them!"
Have been using as directed for several weeks now with no significant results. Does practically nothing for hereditary dark circles. You're better off sticking to cucumber slices and ice and saving money.
"Yahtzee is a great game that I can just play over and over again. It is also a great source for my child to learn numbers, with a fun hands-on activity. My family does not usually spend a lot of time together and we go off in our different direction. Now when I pull out Yahtzee the whole family comes together. I think that ever family should have this game in their household."
"My daughter just received this ship in the mail from her Uncle and it is darn cute! Her grandmother purchased the noah's ark toy for her when she was one and she continues to love that toy even now at 4, wow! This pirate ship is really going to last us since we have 2 more kids to wear it out! Actually, my daughter knocked out early tonight so her brother sat in the corner fiddling around with it for a looong time. Its very cute, makes several neat sounds including ocean and seagulls and comes with 3 lil people (well one parrot) so I was able to give each one of our kids something to play with when we ripped it out of the box! Great investment because I swear that noahs arc toy way 5-10 dollars more!"
"I find it quite humorous that so many comments on this product's advertising describe it as ""gay"". I mean, what about the bottle? What hetero male wants to grab a bottle designed to look like a male torso every time he wants to wear cologne? Oh well, I guess once again the best quality things in life really are gay!"
"I've spent $100's on toys and everything gets destroyed and forgot about in his egg crates (we use them around the house to store his toys). He searches for this toy and has knocked down our gates to get to it (so now we have to hide it when we're done playing with it). He'll play with me or by himself for hours. We have two of these, one big blue one (10in) for outside and this small red one for inside. Reggie is a 11 month old lab and has more energy than we know what to do with so this has really helped burn off some of his energy."
"I have never bought clippers, in fact, i've been wearing my hair long and uncut for a few years now. When I first used the remington clippers, they sliced through my thick shag giving me a bald head. they are very nice clippers and i would recommend them to anyone for home use. I have shaved my head twice and I've already made them worth the price..."
"These pads are just as good as the much more expensive brands; they are not as thick and will feel flimsy to you at first, but they hold all liquid without incident. They fit very nicely in the Paw Traxx tray. I buy size ""Regular."" Roll them up and throw them away without thinking twice about the cost."
"I Like to use frontline on my dogs for peace of mind. I use it all year round as a precaution, protection and prevention. My dogs have never had fleas as yet and I certainly don`t want the unpleasantness of being hit with that kind of problem."
"I've tried just about every treat on my bichon. She eats very few of them. I got a sample package of these with a previous order, and she ate every one of them in record time. She gets very excited when I bring these out & will do just about anything to get one. Finally, a winner at my home!!!"
"Augie Doggy recommended this product and I'm glad I purchased it! I have Golden Retrievers and this rake is amazing! The amount of fur that I'm able to remove from their coats is unbelievable ... and they love the feel of it, too! I would highly recommend this product for anyone who has a long-haired dog."
"I have been using this feeder for the past 6 months and it works very well. I have a 23 year old cat who likes to be fed small amounts, several times a day. The 6 hr. cycle is perfect. The first battery drained fairly soon, but I've had others last 2 months with daily use. I've been trying to find spare ice packs (so that I can reload and go without waiting to refreeze the packs). Lentek didn't respond to my e-mails so I just ordered a 2nd feeder. I've had no problem with the cat trying to force the lid even when her favorite flavor is in the next section. For a 30 hr. feeding cycle, I freeze the last 2 meals so that they thaw just in time. She's a very happy cat."
"My wife and I played this game on New Year's eve with a group of 8 people ranging in age from 16 to 60, and it was the most fun we've had playing a game in many years."
"We used it in a hotel and liked it so we bought 2 from Amazon. Various wind speed. The air is never too hot. The wind is never too powerful. It dries your hair quickly. Light-weight, foldable handle plus retractable cord make it easy to travel. I paid $20 out the door with Amazon Prime. It's better than dryers that are much more expensive. Now we'll just have to see how long they last."
"Love the toy, flashy, lights up and has music but a little tricky when you try to put on or take off the rings! It has a ""catch"" so when you pull the rings off or put them on, it will make sound. Frustrating for little ones. Overall, a neat fun toy though."
There is nothing wrong with the layout of this game simply because this is a game that shows you DisneyWORLD and not Disneyland...
"This is a good game for friends and game nights because it doesn't require a lot of thinking or complicated strategy. I like this game because you have more control over your fate then most ""luck of the draw"" games. You can play a game in about 20 minutes.One note"
"Both of my sisters-in-law love this perfume, so I got them a bottle for Christmas as stocking stuffers. I also got a bottle for a co-worker who I think will like it. I think it's a very nice scent, very fresh and I like D&G in general, as I wear their men's self-titled scent. Amazon had the best price I could find."
"*****This is a review for a ""handy"" or medium sized Mason Pearson brush made of six rings of mixed boar bristle and nylon. The longer bristles are nylon and the shorter ones are boar bristle. It is a beautiful heirloom brush worth every penny of the incredibly high price.All of the larger Mason Pearson brushes, including this one, come with a cleaning brush, so that you can easily clean loose hairs out of your brush.There are two things you should know when you're ready to buy a Mason Pearson brush of any sort. One is the size"
"I have a lab puppy, and for any of you who have read my other reviews, I LOVE idestructable toys, as my puppy is a very strong chewer. After demolishing several smaller bones and puppy kongs, I decided to buy this bone, hoping it really would be good for a strong chewer. It has proved to be everything that Nylabone says it would be. He likes it, and has barely ""made a dent"" in it. There are plenty more play hours to be spent with this toy, and we've had it for several months.Recommended for labs, retreivers, and other big dogs who love to chew!"
"I bought this for my friend's 1 year old son (they are a bilingual family) and he loves it! You can put it into english or spanish. It says numbers 1-10, alphabet, colors and shapes in either language. When you have it in spanish, it speaks only spanish. It does not say the word in spanish and then in english. This may be a turn off for some people, but the easiest way to learn a language is to be truly immersed in it. Also, for babies that cannot stand yet, you can have no legs on it to sit on their lap, or have only two legs on it so it tilts towards them. The one year old can easly reach everything sitting on his knees. The product is very light, so the one year old can push it around, but this is easily solved by having it up against the wall. He can still reach all of the activities. Overall great product, very colorful and educational. I would definitely buy it again!"
"This is a wonderful scent, and one of my overall favorites. All scents are a matter of opinion, but if you like warm amber and vanilla, you should try this! You won't regret it."
I bought a pet training mat to replace one that was accidentally thrown away. The bottom line is that it works and I recommend it.More info
"My Golden loves this ball. I wanted something large enough that it would not fall through the openings of our deck railing. We placed a baby gate at the top of the stairs and let her out with this ball and she just goes nuts over it. I don't see much damage to the ball after about 30 minutes of play. At 10"" it is just a bit too large to get her mouth around so her teeth only scratch the surface. It is somewhat heavy and hard so I don't think I'd use it in the house but on a deck or in the yard or a room with hard walls (e.g paneled, brick, etc.) this ball would work great."
"It does a fantastic job getting the loose fur off of our cats. We had a cheaper brush that looks very similar; the FURminator seems to grab the loose undercoat (exactly as advertised!). It's a little pricey, but well worth it!"
"This is the best scent I have ever owned. I used to purchase from Nordstrom, but they stopped making it. I was thrilled to find it at AMAZON!!"
This Straightener is great! What used to take over half an hour is now just 15 minutes. It heats up quickly and is ready to go by the time I am.
"This item is sold in pet supply stores for a lot more money. I bought the 8 panel pen for our Shih Ztu puppy. She has been using 5 panels now for months. There's plenty of room for blankets, toys etc. She considers this her den and loves it. It's handy because it can be taken apart for traveling, or set up in the yard although we haven't used it outside yet. The 4 panel is shorter, so if you have a jumper, and our Shih Tzu is like a rabbit, you may want to go with the larger pen. The gate has also held up well and is easy to use. Highly recommended."
"My daughter received the Learning Puppy for her birthday mainly because she has all the other toys in the laugh and learn line. We love them all. My daughter likes to play with the puppy but gets frustrated because it doesn't finish a song or phrase. The buttons are too sensitive and if she jostles it even the slightest bit it changes what it was playing. I have tried to move the buttons to put more padding in between but it hasn't worked. It has even started talking in the middle of the night when no one is around it! It is just sitting there all by itself. Scared me to death. Now I make sure to turn it off. I think it is a really great toy; I just got a bad one. I fully promote the other laugh and learn toys, my daughter loves them!"
"My 5 year old son got this for Christmas, and I ended up taking it back to the store. It is dangerous! The pointy pieces stick straight up--it could hurt a child who fell on it! Also, the pieces don't stay together, which was frustrating. My son didn't even play with it."
I holds just over 50lbs and is very sturdy. Great buy for the price. I recently bought a smaller one for cat food. I would definitely recommend this product.
"My stepbrother had one of these on his keyring, and I would hear him playing with it for hours. The song started to get really annoying so I went over and asked him what it was. Once I tried it, I was totally addicted to it and had to get one. I am 24! I got my mom and my sister one and they both became Bop It addicts as well. Although I have to say, after about 3 days it gets really old. But, I just put mine down and pick it up a few days later and it's fun again.The Pro's"
"We received this bucket of dominos as a gift. My 7 yo son spends hours playing with them. He enjoys lining them up and making them tumble. He likes them so much, in fact, that I purchasing another 2 buckets from Amazon. They are light weight and durable. The square shape makes them easy to store. The handle makes it fun/easy to carry. We like them much better than the heavy, traditional dominoes."
Husband wanted to rock some retro style while being patriotic and stopping some sweat. Looks great. Great quality. Great size.
"I first tried this perfume, while in Paris approximately 15 years ago. It is my very favorite perfume. It has a soft fragrance of a garden and lingers gently over the day. Friends at the University where I taught often complemented me on this ever so subtle fragrance.Arlene O. Nichols"
"I love sweet perfumes, and this is one of my favorites. It is a true vanilla scent and smells absolutely delicious. Like other reviewers have mentioned, compliments abound when one wears this fragrance. Most people small vanilla, but I've had a few people tell me I smell like chocolate (one person even said waffle cones!). Either way, I smell great!My only problem is that the scent seems to dissipate quickly. I can spray it on and it seems to have disappeared just a few hours later."
This was the only place I could find the perfume/body lotion/body wash combo from Perry Ellis Woman. Love it - can't believe they discontinued this scent - but I have stocked up!
"A very special person introduced me to this perfume awhile ago. It is the only fragrance I currently wear, love the citrus, fresh scent. Not to strong, and can be worn summer or winter."
My dog loves this toy this is his second one he has torn up the first one. This toy requires the puppy to think and will keep them busy a lot longer than just a chewy or squeeky toy
I liked the first set I got so much i oredered more. Works great at keeping cats away from spraying on curtain and furniture.
I have a Great Pyrenees and she loves this bed! She hangs off of the large size a little bit but it still helps a lot. She laid on it immediately and spent the whole night right there. I would definitely recommend this bed for anyone with a large hairy dog or one that pants a lot. We are using it in the winter too. Glad I found this for her.
I bought this with the idea that my pet can stay toasty warm and it would be with minimal energy used. I heat it up and put it under his blanket and he stays toasty warm until morning. He is one happy cat!
"My daughter loves all three of these rattles, however after she had a cold, I wanted to disinfect the toys. I put the butterflies in boiling water, and they melted! Altough I love the product I was somewhat disappointed that it wouldn't be made of a material that could be boiled to disenfect."
"It is a sweatband, what kind of review do you want - it collects sweat so you don't have to wipe it off of your face - it also looks totally rasta"
"I bought this for my nephew for christmas and decided to put it together ahead of time. Thinking it would be one less thing to put together. The only problem was that my 4 and 7 year old girls love it. They want me to buy my nephew something else. My girls play Barbies and house, girl stuff. But, they love this because it is for the kid with an imagination, hence the name. I also have boys and they love it also. So far, the kids have all played well together. This is a great toy."
When I got my order it was professionally packed.I am pleased with fast and reliable service.Thanks
"I love lemon verbena soap/lotion that I have purchased from places such as Evelyn & Crabtree. This however, is absolutely awful smelling - and actually gave me a sick feeling. The lemon note is pure citronella"
"We got this Large Air Dog Squeaker Tennis Ball for our 80lb dog, since he easily destroys regular tennis balls with the strength of his teeth - and he loves it! He's been playing with it on & off for a few days now, and it's still in great shape - a first for him & tennis balls (smile)!Although this tennis ball was only meant for him, we've found that our 2 smaller dogs have also enjoyed playing with this big ball - even though it's really too big for them - it's really a joy to watch!Overall, I would highly recommend this squeaky tennis ball for all large-breed dogs. It seems to be quite well made & allows them to have a tennis ball that's just right for their size."
Bought for my mom's new puppy - a bishon shihtzsu - who just ripped these up.
"I have relatively clear skin, but I started breaking out in college. I've never had huge breakouts that covered my entire face in bumps, just spots around my nose, forehead, and chin. I also have hormonal breakouts and the occasional cystic pimple. So I'd recommend this to people with mild to moderate acne and flareups.I tried this when it first came out because the reviews were so positive, and it worked great for me. Definitely worked better than ProActiv, at a lower price and without the hassle of a monthly bill and getting stuck in an auto-shipment.It doesn't smell bad- not great, but it doesn't smell like you're putting a ton of acne stuff on your face. And I love the two different lotions you get. The day lotion is great, light, and has SPF. The night lotion is heavier and great at zapping zits. The cleanser is gentle but exfoliating. All together, the system works great.I do wish the individual lotions/cleanser were sold separately. It's convenient having them all in a kit, but I ran out of everything at different times. I used up the cleanser first, then the day lotion, then the night lotion. But I had to buy a whole new kit and replace everything, so it seemed a little wasteful. Also, like any acne kit, this can be drying, so you may need another moisturizer, especially in the winter.My skin has calmed down since I first used this, but I'd still recommend this. Try this product first before you call an informercial- of all the acne systems I've used, this one gave me the best results."
It got here fast and we paid about half of retail price on it and my girlfriend tells me it works great.
I love this hand cream. Basically no smell (and I am sensitive to smells) and really helps dry hands. I use it once or twice a day - especially in winter and do not get the cracking skin like I used to get.
"I only ordered this because I was ordering something else, the primary product I was after was not sent so I would have to say never order from Beauty Encounter unless you like bad customer service, wrong products, and hassle and headache when trying to return items that were sent due to their mistake. In the past I had really liked Neutrogena poor refining products, but they had to monkey around and discontinue products. This is one of the new ones they have brought out since monkeying around with the line, but it misses the mark and I cannot really tell it is doing anything for my skin."
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my nine year old but of course all parents know that we have to play with their toys before we wrap them. This is the coolest action figure I have ever seen. I love the noises it makes as you're flying him around the room and the punching action. I also think it's time for us to introduce our children to the things we watched as children. My sons love Wonder Woman and have seen season one and two so it seemed like a good idea to also show them Superman! I am very pleased with the return of things from our childhood that was VERY clean and family oriented.
"I'm not the sort of collector who feels the need to get every single figure in a line -- I tend to get my favorite characters only, and I couldn't resist this figure. Out of the three sets of toys released with the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, this is the best-looking Aragorn figure yet. We get him here in his Gondorian garb that he wears for the final battle before the Black Gates of Mordor, the emblem of the White Tree upon his chest, Anduril in his hand. This is Aragorn the King.This figure is super-posable -- a ton of articulation. Toy Biz, it seems has found the way to give us articulation without sacrificing the look of an action figure -- this is a toy that both looks great and plays great.The only complaint I would have is that the box says that Aragorn can hold Anduril two-handed, and I haven't been able to get mine to do that -- he's quite articulated, but the arms don't bend inwards quite enough to allow that pose.All in all, though, it's a great action figure, and a must for ROTK fans."
"I really like Santa Fe fragrance - great product. Only two issues I have is I wish they made a small size spill-proof container since I travel frequently, and when I use the product it seems that every time some product spills down the side of the container."
"This Electric Collar PUL-250 works great. The house we moved into had an underground fence, but no collar. I wasn't sure this collar would work. It works wonderful."
"Its a bit cumbersome at first, but it does work. Though my husky did manage to undo one of the suctions and tried to make a run for it."
I'm an elementary teacher and my students love this. I like that students are able to check their work and make corrections on their own. I gave this toy 4 stars for educational value because some of the cards aren't very clear about what the students are supposed to do; I have had to explain several of them to my students. I gave the durability 4 stars as well because the buttons that you slide sometimes get stuck and I have had one pop out. Overall I really recommend the Logico Board.
"I've been wearing L'eau D'issey perfume for 10 yrs now. I love it so much. It's so romantic, in my opinion, but the scent isn't knock-ya-on-your-buttinsky heavy - it's light and tantalizing. I also get compliments from both women and men. The women want it, and the men think it is sexy! The L'eau D'issey cream is so wonderful. The scent stays and is perfect for layering, and the moisturization stays too! I love it. I bought two jars of the cream, even, so I won't have to worry about running out of it anytime soon. L'eau D'issey is my signature scent."
"I was looking for a quiet hair dryer to replace one I had that broke. This one is quieter than others I have had, though still not really quiet. It is light and dries hair quickly. I need another and am ordering it again. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I wish it folded for easier storage."
"Carcassonne is a great game with a medieval theme. Players deploy knights, thieves, farmers, and monks onto tiles containing cities, roads, fields, and cloisters. The tiles build onto one another to create a land that is unique to each game session. Explaining how to play it makes it sound more difficult than it actually is, but once you get going, it's not that hard. A bit of strategy is involved, but a bit of luck is as well. This game is fun for all ages!"
"I tried Avalon's Tea Tree Scalp Treatment Shampoo because I'd developed a sensitive, itchy scalp with some flakes. I prefer using sulfate-free shampoo as I have color-treated hair & sulfates strip color.This is a decent shampoo, with pretty good lather for being sulfate free. It smells nice, & it does make my scalp feel a bit cool (literally), which I like. But even after a few weeks, the condition of my scalp hadn't improved. I'd say this is a good product for maintaining a healthy scalp & hair; but if you're really trying to heal an irritated scalp, it probably won't do the trick. Never thought I'd say this, but after much trial & error, I've ended up using the ol' classic H&S.; It (the H&S;) may have sulfates & other non-organic ingredients, but finally my head is back to feeling & looking normal."
I guess it works. no complaints yet. will have to revise if I see that it doesn't work. I searched the net to find the cheapest frontline and amazon was the cheapest.
"Advantix is very effective at keeping fleas and ticks off my dog, and there are a lot of them where we live. Use it once a month."
It is what it is. A Ralphie bobblehead! It sure beats the hell out of putting another snow globe on your coffee table.
I purchased the v smile system as well as this game and my childrenlove it. They have played it about every day since Christmas. They are learning as well as having fun. It is a excellent choice.
"I've given this only 3 stars so far. The Frownies have been relaxing my muscles between my eyes. I actually frowned out about this product from my mother from whom I inherited the Frown gene, , genetic traits are a bitch!) but I noticed that her frown lines were less noticible. I ask if she had gotten Botox treatments but she said she was using Forwnies but that they had gone up in price at the Drug store so she's stopped using them. I bought her more for Mother's Day.Using Frownies is not very attractive for you ""significant other"", having to wake up to seeing you with tape plastered onto your forehead, but I think that this bargain over the temporary results paid for Botox. Ugly mornings being what they are Frownies is something that he can live with for the short run if I can look smoother for the long run! ;-)I'll give more stars in a few weeks after I see more improvements."
I bought this for my 4 lbs shih tzu puppy. The quality it is not as expected - it looks like those toy purses for girls. My puppy hardly fits in there and the bottom is not sturdy.
"I was looking for a small treat that was soft, wouldn't have to cut down to size, mostly protein and made in the US.PRO:They are a one bite size. No cutting needed even for smaller dogs.Dogs love. I haven't met one that doesn't like it. My dog is picky about treats.They smell but like salmon, nothing offensive.Low in calorie so you don't need to worry when training.CONS:They dry out. I ended up storing them in an airtight container.OVERALL:It's a treat my dog loves and it's not harming her and I don't have to deal with cutting it down. I wish I had these when we were doing puppy class and going through a ton of treats nightly."
Did not receive the product size I wanted. Supplier took return and shipped correct size. The correct size actually cost more but the supplier did not charge me more.Excellent company to deal with
I bought this for my 4 year old son who saw how great this was on TV. We got it open Christmas Day and it took my forever putting it together. Then within minutes it had fallen apart. We have since then thrown it away. I wished he could have enjoyed it better.
"The only nice quality of this product is its color. Believe me. It does not straighten your hair as it claims, it just dries it. Plus, it is really, really heavy.Really, dont buy it. I wish someone had told me before buying this thing."
Was hesitant to spend so much for a hair dryer but after using the Chi Rocket I can't say enough good things about it. My hair is very thick and with my cheaper dryer it took me for ever to blow my hair dry and I'm sure it was not doing my hair any good. Worth every $$$$.
Two of my children have mild to moderate eczema. When my 2 year was born his skin became very red and dry once we brought him home from the hospital. My 4 year old had eczema so I just used the lotion on my newborn I was using on my 4 year old. It didn't work. I went through several different lotions. He was put on prescription strength hydrocrotisone because it wasn't getting better. Then I came across the gentle wash and thought I'd give it a try. It worked wonders in a matter of days. Now I use the gentle wash on both of my children and I don't need to lotion them after their baths during the summer. I know with the colder and dry weather coming I'll use the gentle wash and then Eucerin Lotion. People don't believe me when I say my boys have eczema. If your child has eczema or just sensitive skin this product will help.
"This rope toy is a 'Christmas' stocking stuffer, so my dog hasn't used it yet ... however, she loves to have special toys inside to chew on in the evenings. She's a German Shorthair Pointer.. and those dogs are 'serious chewers' .. I can smell the 'mint' flavor, so I think she will like it.. Her main goal is 'chewing', so I hope this holds up well .. She's not destructive, and knows what 'toys' she can chew on...She has 3 toys inside that she keeps 'in one place' so she can find them... and this will be just one more that she can chew on.. I hope it 'flosses' her teeth well too.. she has great 'white teeth' for a 7 yr. old..."
LeapFrog Learn & Groove Alphabet DrumMy son loves this toy and so do the parents. The English/Spanish choice is great and he can't put it down.Thanks.
"Wanting something different from the other activity tables available, I sought this toy out about six months ago, finally finding it on-line. Sadly, my now 15 month old son has had very little interest in it except to attempt to climb onto it. I will hang on to it, assuming he might get more interested (in the train for example) as he gets older, but so far he has not even really gotten into it at all. Ironically, his aunt got him one of the other activity tables at a garage sale a few months ago, and he loves it!!"
"I really love this product! I have a Maine Coon cat, and there just aren't any litter pans in the stores that she can get her whole body in. In this one, she has plenty of room to do her business, and the mess has been practically eliminated."
"It works great!!! I didn't know that so I bought 1 to share with my 2 dogs. Unfortunately while it works for one, the other one barks and sprays the quiet dog wearing the collar. Anyways, need to purchase another, but what a difference!"
"my son got this toy for christmas and was too young for it, but i brought it out when he was 6 mos old and he absolutely loved it.he plays with the balls and drops them in the basket, and it's fun for the cat as well because he tries to get the balls out of the tray as well!fun for the whole family.and very durable. it's banged around a lot and has held up.def worth the money."
"I received lithium batteries instead of the alkaline ones I ordered. As directed, I emailed the supplier but they failed to respond. I will therefore refuse my credit card charge."
"I don't usually write toy reviews but I have been reading several from others on other products, and I think this is a great way to inform those on a budget of what not to waste their $ on. This simply did not keep my almost 4 year old girl entertained. I have taken it out of the toy box several times to encourage her to play w/ it, and it simply bores her.Not worth the money in my opinion."
"This is one of the best color products on the market for covering grays. Ignore the review from the person who gave it one star. If you don't know enough about haircoloring to know that you need a developer, then frankly, you shouldn't be doing it yourself. Use 20 volume developer and process according to the instructions. Great coverage!"
"I love this curling iron! The 1 1/2"" makes really loose curls. It's really great if you want those long, loose waves look. It gets REALLY hot in the hotter settings, which helps a lot in keeping the hold. But, my curls tend to fall out after awhile still so use hairspray. Overall, a wonderful purchase and I might buy another one with a smaller barrel for a more nighttime/glamorous look."
"First, let me say, this is the first RC plane of any type that I have ever flown. After thouroghly reading the instructions last night, this afternoon I took Supes on his maiden voyage. I did have some crashes, but after about 10 - 20 minutes of trial and error, I started getting some decent flights. I admit I was skeptical at first, but this thing actualy does fly! It does have a tendency to veer to the right, but once I got the hang of it I was able to fairly easily compensate for it by steering in the other direction (I have not tried using the included weights to balance it yet). Keys to a successful flight"
been playing poker for a long time now and i can say that this is one of the top cards you can get.
My son received this as a gift for his 4th birthday. He loves them! He sleeps with them and carries them in his pocket during the day! What a great choice!
"My cats had chronic goobery eyes and sneezing before they went on L Lysine supplements. I tried the powder first, sprinkled on their food. The cats seemed to resist eating until they were starving, and their was often powder left in their bowls. I was skeptical about this product because of the price and possibility that they wouldn't like it, but both cats eat it all. I squeeze their dose right on top of their dry food and never see a trace of it in their bowls. The best part is that I have seen a dramatic improvement in their health. Both cats have clear eyes and their noses to not run, eliminating the constant sneezing. I had only seen mild improvement with the powder - perhaps because they were not getting the entire dose? I have tapered them down to every other day and still have not seen a return of symptoms. Great product. Highly recommended."
"My 5-year old son (and I) love this. We make castles together and then have battles. We bought several of the accessory pieces so we could have more good and bad knights to engage in combat. Lots of fun. Having a hard time finding good knights (those dressed in blue and silver, according to my son), horses, and goblins. Hard to have the epic ""Helm's Deep"" battle with the 3 or 4 figures included in the castle set. Hopefully FP will send more out."
"Our 4-year-old loves it. We play all together and we all enjoy it (my husband and I). It's educational, but he doesn't even notice how he uses math. It's fun math It's very colorful and teaches a child to take turns. I would recommend this game."
"I actually bought this for my daughter 3 months before she was born, but I am so glad I did. She loves going to sleep with Pooh and Piglet. The only complaint I would make is that it is a bit loud at first, but because the light and sound get softer each time a new musical segment starts I think a volume knob wouldn't work as well. I just make sure it is far enough away from her head. Because the voicebox is very hard and the pillow not that padded, you also need to be careful about it hitting little heads. My daughter (now 7 months) loves to turn it on and off when she's playing with it (of course that does drive mommy batty). I think this is a great toy overall."
"This is a very thoughtfully designed, well crafted, set.The chess board (not the unit) measures right at 8 cm square. (That's a little over 3 inches.) The plastic pieces adhere to a standard Staunton design. The color scheme for both board and pieces is intelligent and standard, meeting the needs of experienced players.When closed (i.e., the top on), a game in progress will retain its position. The captured pieces will stay in their compartments (at each end of the board). There is no need to fear the unit's being shaken or turned upside down when the unit is closed. Before you do open it, give the unit a little lateral shake. That will settle any captured pieces most comfortably in their compartments before you remove the lid.The one characteristic that will concern some people is the small size of the pieces, but they are proportioned to the size of the board. If the size of the pieces causes a problem, then you are looking for a larger set.Will it fit in a pocket? Well, it will fit in my shirt pocket, but I wouldn't want to carry it that way normally. It's approximately an inch thick, and about 3.75 x 5.5 inches. It fits comfortably in the hand, and, when in use, the top lid fits the unit as a bottom, so that everything stays together. It is very portable.In addition to the set, you get two extra white queens, two extra black queens, two extra white pawns, and two extra black pawns. The queens are in the event of pawn promotions, and the pawns are presumably because they are statistically the most likely to get lost, since half of the army consists of pawns.Although inexpensive peg chess sets (&lt;$10 US) were once easily procured, they are difficult to find these days. After much searching, I was happy to find one as well thought out as this one."
I really like this comb. It works great on my dogs and it was much more reasonably priced thru Amazon. Thank you.
"I used this small Starmark Training collar on my 6 year old 10 pound Chihuahua. He has worn a harness his whole life and would pull like crazy and when i would try a regular nylon collar he would do some choking thing. The day i got the new starmark collar, i put it on no problem! Instantly ( ia m not even joking) he walked calmly and absolutely no pulling. NONE! not even when other dogs were passing. Great collar!! totally recommend to anyone wanting a calm, structured walk!"
"This is a great, great product. My hair has never looked better...plenty of volume and touchable. Still my hair style lasts all day, even easy to get back into shape when it's breezy outside.This spray is very easy to use."
"I went to Trader Joe`s and paid $3.99. Great price and quality! I used to use other brands pads that cost from $16 to $30. This stuff clears pores, and helps with blemishes, also gives a healthy glow. Smell doesn`t bother me (the other pads are also strong), I would call it a medical/herbal. If someone has combination or oily skin, and breakout from time to time or everyday those pads are very helpful. I use them after cleansing as a tonic. On the days when I feel dry or my face clears out then I don't use them. The price is a killer. I would buy them online if I live in a states without TJ stores, even with shipping is worth it."
its a must if you have 2 full size cats.. especially that it has top opening for my scaredy cats I bought the wheels too... very smart idea ...could have use instructions though it took a bit of time to figure out how those side pieces snapped on.
"I read somewhere that this is supposed to shoot out 2-8 cards, well every time it shot out cards it was 8 to 12 - EVERY TIME! The first and only game went on for about 2 frekin hours and then we decided to convert the game to normal UNO rules and get rid of the stupid shooter, which finally let someone win. This was a brand new game, just out of the package."
"I have not seen any babies playing with this toy so I can't review it in that capacity but what I can say is that the person I bought this for thought this was a very cute toy for her baby. The only drawback is that the birds have eyes that can come off. Babies really like the crinkly squishy shapes, and it would have been better if the birds didn't have eyes that can come off and become choking hazards. It says its for babies 8 months and above probably because of the eyes. Of course any babies younger wouldn't know how to use the shape sorter but they would probably enjoy feeling the birds and squishing them and chewing on them. Without the eyes I think this toy would be for a broader age range."
I bought this product to help soothe my razor burned neck. It ended up making my neck much worse. Very red and irritated.
"This product is easy to install and arrived on time. I have 3 cats ages 9 years,4 years and 1 year, they adjusted to the door very well."
"I have had these &quot;twisters&quot; for about 8 months. They curl the hair well. However, I had to modify the directions. Remington explains that one end of the curler goes through the hole in the opposite end so no clips are needed. Unfortunately, I did not have success with the twisters staying in my hair doing this. After rolling my hair on the rod, I use a hair comb/clip to keep it in place. This product has more rods than the some other models by other manufacturers. I think that makes it a more attractive buy."
Amazing brush! With the first use I removed a carpet of hair from my GREYHOUND without irritating his skin. So many tumbleweeds of hair were floating around the yard that birds came to collect them! No joke. When my boyfriend came home and saw the hair he asked if I had brushed our CAT!
Have been using this brush for almost 15 years. I wish they were easier to find but at least I can order them online. They don't pull your hair and feel so good on the scalp. It's the only brush my daughter and I will use. Once you get one you'll never use another brush!
"This product came in a timely fashion, is a great product. Mickey, my very active cat, has pursued it for several weeks with no damage to the product.I would recommend it and the seller."
"Def. amplified my curls and gave them definition. However, I didn't get enough volume as I typically like. I felt that it weigh my curls down a tad but but would def. keep using unti lthe bottle is finished. However, I HATE the smell. It smells a little fishy."
"I have used almost every self-tanning product available. This product looks very real and doesn't dry out my skin. You Must be very careful when applying and rub it in well. It comes with gloves and if you don't use them, your palms will be tan too! Fake Bake is my favorite:)"
"Ok, so the picture quality isn't great, but my kids don't notice and are THRILLED with the camera. My son took his camera to his 5th bday party at the bowling alley and all the kids had a blast passing the camera around taking pictures of each other. I would have been freaking if my camera was being passed around, but this camera took the abuse and all the parents loved it. It does need a larger memory card, but almost all ""adult"" cameras that I've bought needed a larger memory card. The only problem I have is that my daughter wants one of her own."
This chess clock (Excalibur) is adequate. Not as comfortable as the pricier chrono clocks but meets requirements and expectations. Has a very large number of preset modes. Straightforward to operate. Looks and feels a little bit flimsier than some others but I am not sure whether it is only looks. The buttons to press feel a bit odd but there are no real problems. I understand this clock was and is now again the USCF standard. Buying it from Amazon was as usual a fine idea as the item arrived safely and being a prime member I did not have to pay shipping. I recommend the clock.
"I have been using this products for more than 3 years, and it really works on my skin. Every time after using it, the skin just looks fresh and bright. Definately recommend it for all skin types."
"The description states that this product can be used on small breeds, but the instructions on the package state not to use on dogs under 8 lbs! This really should be stated on the product description page to save people such as myself the headache of having to return the item."
"I do not recommend this toy. By the time your child is old enough to manipulate the tiny keys, they will find the presentation too juvenile. More importantly, the edges are dangerously sharp."
"Thirty-eight years with the same woman and I ever get tired of nuzzling her and just inhaling her with this fragrance. My wife spritzes twice into the air and then walks through the little cloud as the first thing she does after drying off from her shower. I enjoy the fragrance and the performance! While the sent is not light, neither is it heavy like many other scents that try to achieve this effect. I use the words ""warm"" or ""heady"" as it is almost as much a visceral presence as a fragrance. To me it doesn't smell like ""floral"" or ""spicy"" although both elements are probably there. To me, it just smells like ""sexy woman""."
"If you like Risk then get this game as quick as you can.The addition of the commanders, the cards, the moon and the underwater cities are great. But what really sets this game apart is the addition of 'energy' and the limited number of rounds.You acquire energy at the start of your turn just like reinforcement troops. You use the energy to buy commanders and cards but you also use it to bid for turn order. The new turn order at the start of each round adds all kinds of new strategies to the game. I hope other games pick up this idea.The limited number of rounds means you know the game will be over in a couple of hours instead of lasting all night like the old game. We usually play two or three five player games in one night. It also means no more sitting around building up forces. Your buddies who like to sit on their hands will quickly learn they have to get on the ball and act each turn."
"After a couple of our wand toys broke in half, we got this one. It's great. The cats absolutely love it, the wand can bend and withstand quite a bit of pressure without breaking. It does come apart so to combat that I put some super glue in the joint and now it is fine.The cat loves it so much she walks around with it around our house. In the morning I usually find it in our bed because she's brought it there to play with during the night.It has been about 2 months and I might need a re-fill soon because the cats have chewed off part of the feather.It is great because I can sit on the couch and read and hold the wand up and the cats can play some feet away from me.The sister toy to this which we also got is made by the same brand and is a little leather mouse attached to a metal string - they love this toy even more. I can't remember the name of it."
"I have got to say this item is a lot safer then a normal treat ball. It still produces the same result as the hard ball, but it is safer for the dogs. No longer do I worry about the dog getting the treat ball stuck on their teeth. I will buy again if it ever wears out for sure.Sheri"
"I've used Aussie shampoos and conditioners in the past, but hadn't tried their hairspray. It holds well without being sticky and has a pleasant aroma. I priced it and that's the only thing I can find negative about this particular product. I can purchase a similar product at a lower cost."
"I bought this dinosaur because my son really wanted a Carnotaurus after watching Dinosaur King. Unfortunately, it is very small, just a couple inches tall in the middle, and frankly looks pretty goofy. It looks like the quality of something you could purchase at the dollar store. It doesn't compare to the dinosaurs from Schleich and it is one of the least played with dinosaurs in my son's collection."
We love Futurama and this sign was purchased for my son's office cubicle. I think this will crack him up. Now how about some Red Dwarf collectibles!
"The style copter I received was different than those pictured, which I take are made of Styrofoam. Mine was the spindly plastic Marines branded bubble canopy copter.I find it to be quite difficult to control, even after tweaking with the micro weights and trim. It had a severe counter-clockwise spin and even full right trim is barely able to offset it, it still spins CC slightly. Very durable. I should know, I've crashed it often enough and if I don't crash it, the cat will swat it out of the air eventually (awesome cat toy BTW).A full charge takes about 15 minutes from empty to full and seems to provide about half that in flight time"
My puppy wasn't sure about this toy at first but now it keeps him busy for awhile trying to get at the treats that are attached to the toy. It seems to be good quality and should last for quite awhile.
This game is a lot of fun and helps teach numbers and following directions. My 4 year old great grandson loves it.
"My husband was very pleased with his gift. And I was VERY pleased with the price, almost 85% off store prices!"
"I am very satisfied with this merchant. This product is often sold by veterinarians for a lot more. It's highly concentrated, so after diluting to desired concentration you actually get a lot more for your money that you initially expected."
"I have used this for years and still use it because it works, it is well priced and is pleasant to use. It's lightweight, non-greasy, no unpleasant scent, and really does produce a smoother, clearer skin.I apply it once a day in the AM, allow it to sink in and then apply a moisturizer with SPF 30 before I go out. I use a different kind of product with anti-oxidents at night before night cream. I figure that way I cover all my bases. But this product is an inportant part of my routine and I get lots of compliments on my skin."
"My husband and I got the fydo collar for our long-haired chihuahua. The Fydo collar wouldn't have been our first choice, but our Chihuahua idolizes her big sister, a Terrier Mix who loves to swim. When our Chihuahua took to the water, the collar had to change. I found the Fydo collar by accident looking for the Gummipet collar (which our terrier wears). If it hadn't been on sale here at Amazon for and outrageously low price ($5 for the small solid pink one) we probably wouldn't have bought one.For the most part, we really like it. I'll break down our likes and dislikes for easy reading.PROS:1) Waterproof - gotta love that!2) Stylish and unusual - Dog collars for my girls are something that I spend far too much money on. I love waterproof collars (since they're both water dogs) but so many of them are so ugly. The Fydo collars (and the Gummipets collars) are both fairly stylish in terms of waterproof dog collars.3) ""No chew"" latch system - this one is also an AWESOME addition. Our chihuahua will chew on a 1cm length of spare collar until there's nothing left but a ragged edge. We do like that there are no ""chewable"" ends.4) Personalization - hubby and I have taken out the metal ""Fydo"" insert to make our own (more on this below in the CON section).CONS:1) The pink color seems to stain or dirty easily. Considering how much time our dogs spend in the water, I would think the collar would look less dirty. But it constantly looks like its got a thin layer of grunge on it, even when I wipe it off with baby wipes.2) FYDO metal insert - oy, vey, this was a design flaw. It's a little too heavy and falls out easily, but I do like the design of the collar, so I create my own inserts. For those Fydo owners who are frustrated by the hole left in the collar by the missing insert, I have taken to making my own. I found a background from the internet that matches the collar and seems appropriate (for my pup it was rainbow daisies), pasted that to Powerpoint and customized her name, our phone number, and other information in the space. I cut it out in the oval shape and laminate it (I have a laminator at home) and it looks great, its waterproof, its custom, and it costs me only pennies to make.3) Latch system - I really do like the collars system of ""no chew"" ends, but sometimes the latch can be incredibly difficult to undo if you need to remove the collar. I've found that if you undo the inside one first, the oustide one will be easier to unlatch.Overall, my husband and I are quite happy. I would love to buy her the transparent blue, but will wait for it to go on sale again."
This is an amazing product and Desert Essence has stopped making it! Amazon had this product and i bought 3 to last me a while. Arrived well packaged and quickly. Good dea!
"I LOVE this shampoo! Since September, I've been searching high and low for a shampoo that will remove flakiness, product build up and be gentle in my relaxed hair and this product fits the bill! I was fortunate to discover this product at one of my local Sephora stores approximately 2 weeks ago and I'm glad that I decided to give it a chance. This is one of the very few shampoos that lives up to its promise. It's definitely appropriate for dry hair and scalp and I love how it has a creamy texture. In my experience, runny/liquidy type shampoos are rough and drying on my relaxed hair. Creamy shampoo types are the way to go. Even BEFORE rinsing out the shampoo, I could feel how soft my hair was and after rinsing out the product, I was actually able to comb through my hair with ease (using a regular size comb) BEFORE applying conditioner! This shampoo combined with Ojon Tawaka Conditioner makes my hair amazingly soft and frizz free! If it wasn't for the ridiculous high price (i.e., $30 CAD), I would have rated this shampoo a 5-star. Finally, I would definitely recommend this shampoo to anyone with dry hair and scalp."
"I bought this toy for my son and he absolutely loves it. All of his toys seem to get a one or two day play/attention lifespan from him which is pretty normal for most young kids. But this toy has yet to fall from grace. It's played with almost all day, everyday.The attention to detail is great and it has amazing posing possibilities. It's a versatile toy if you have some of the Original Trilogy figures... no need to buy a Darth since this Anakin doll can be transformed into the evil Lord Vader. If only Hasbro and Lucas would issue a similar figure for Supreme Chancellor Palpatine in which he could transform into Darth Sidious.The only draw back to this toy -- AND THIS IS A BIG ONE -- is that the top of the helmet doesn't secure to top of the Anakin/Vader head and constantly falls off during play. And of course, as mentioned in other reviews on this page... those darned boots (for both the Anakin and the Darth costumes) are almost impossible to get back on once taken off."
"I have a 2 and 3 year old, they had a blast. The balls are fun and colorful. My boys love it. The legs are easy to remove. Nice and fun toys for toddlers+."
"I like this perfume. I wear many fragrances, but this one is an old favorite. It is musky, yet feminine and powdery-floral at the same time. Perfect for work, because it is light, and it smells really nice but isn't overpowering. Other brands tried copying this scent, but somehow they managed to add something that either irritates my allergies, or makes the fragrance smell too strong (Prince Matchabelli, Parfums De Coeur). If you've never tried this, don't snub it because of the price; buy a bottle today and experience white musk!"
"It is nice that the cover comes off so you can throw it in the wash. This size does seem a little large for my cats (1 is 8.5 lbs the other is 12 lbs.) I think they prefer places that have a little more hiding involves and places to cuddle up a little tighter. It was worth the price, though."
Good toy. Kids love it. Play with it often. When other kids come over they play with it also.
"product worked really well, took a little long to dry. Smells great when you first apply it but a few hours later it smells like classic self tanner. other then that it gave me a great tan!"
This product is great for what I had to buy it for. I forgot my blow dryer and knew it would be cheaper to get it on amazon prime than buy one at cvs.I have no real complaints since I paid less than $15 for it.I would not buy this product if you have long hair. My hair seems to always get tangled in the dryer when I use it - and that is really quite frustrating. I wish I had paid more and purchased one that had a slightly longer barrel.
"My son Logan (7) says:Its a great toy. It has a place for the pirates to sleep, shelter, etc. I use it with my other Imaignext sets for battles. It stays set up in my room for days! I recommend this toy!"
"I have the video now color player and black and white player. The color player has a bigger screen and better picture. I have 14 video now color disks and 12 video now black and white disks. The black and white disks still work on the color player but the color disks do not work on the black and white player. I just got this and I have used it a lot since. My favorite disk is the Agent Cody Banks movie. It shows the whole movie, but it is on 4 disks."
"This gates gets the job done, keeping the dogs out of my son's room. It arrived quickly and was easy to use."
"I've bought this product from Amazon before but perhaps from a different vendor. Anyway, when I opened the box, some portion have already been spilled insid the box as there was no seal on the cap which was not the case w/ my previous purchase of this product. Then it makes me wonder if this product was legit or not."
"I liked this fragrance since I was a kid, today I am still a man and I still enjoy, this is one of best perfumes in the market."
"As so many others have said already, this straightener is TRASH! I had been on the lookout for a straightener that gets hot enough to straighten my very thick, wavy hair. I've tried them all.And then I found the Revlon RV059C. It heats up extremely quickly and is super hot. Sure, it caught a few hairs between the plates and ripped them out, but once I learned how to use it, this didn't happen as often. It straightened my hair fast (only took about 10 minutes) and got it silky smooth. I loved it!Then it broke. The red light wouldn't work, and the plates wouldn't heat up. I kept it going for a while by banging it on the counter to jar the red light, but soon it died for good.Of course, I thought, it was just this particular one. So I went out and bought a new one which worked beautifully - for about 3 months. Then presto, one plate stopped working. Simply wouldn't heat up.OK, I thought. This is not the same problem as the last one. Maybe it's a fluke. Maybe I have just had bad luck. Maybe I shouldn't buy another one from the same company. But it's the only straightener I've found that really works! So what do I do? ::STUPID, STUPID:"
"This is such a fun game! My son received it as a gift for his third birthday. He knows all of his letters so we were able to play the advanced level. He loves the anticipation of whether or not the ball will be in the slot he chooses. I would highly recommend this game for learning the basics...letters, counting, colors. I hope it will continue to hold his interest...it is more interactive than the classics like Hi Ho Cherry-O or Candyland, etc., so I think we will continue to play and enjoy it."
"My wife and I enjoy Rummikub when it's just us playing, but I was quite surprised to see how well my 9 and 12 year old cousins enjoyed it! One of them even requested it as their birthday gift!"
"I received the mirror with a purple frame after reading all the great reviews. The mirror is very distorted, just like another recent reviewer said. It looks like a fun house mirror and I can't stand looking at it. I don't want my baby looking at it either! I am emailing lamaze to see if they changed the design."
"OMG! I got this toy for Christmas and at first it was really fun. I decided to bring it to my grandmas to show my cousins. first time I flew it it crashed to the ground and my cousins dog took it. Allthogh he was gentle with it, in a few hours the plastic tail broke off. It stillflew but it looks like a peace of trash next to my cousins Havoc Stinger. Hers was made of styrophome too, but wayyyyy more durible. Take this from an upset 9 year old:DON'T BUY THIS HELI!!!!!!!!!!"
"I recently flew to Hawaii with my 13 month old son... I had a collection of new and fun toys to fill our time. The MyMP3 was BY FAR the best of the bunch. We played it continuously for more than an hour of the flight, both ways. It kept him quiet, intriqued and entertained the entire time. Fortunately, it has a volume dial so we were able to turn it down a little. It also has a knob at the top so they can twist and change their screen cover, which my son loved because he likes to fidget with things. Some of the songs weren't my first choice, but we could just skip past them. Note that there is not a way to add or remove songs. You get the 14 that they chose. Regardless, I HIGHLY recommend this toy, especially if you are looking at a long flight or car ride ahead of you!"
I LOVE the curling iron. I heats quickly and works great. The cord bends easily and that is a nice feature. Would recommend this to everyone...
"I bought this unit to cut the hair on my two shi-tzus. It didn't come with the right tool, so that was another expense. When I bought the tool, it didn't cut at all. I had to go back to the cheap unit. I'm very dissatisfied."
"Plain and simple, smells great, fast shipping, and since its a 6.8 oz it should last a while"
"Looking back at it, I'm not sure what I thought this stuff would do... So I guess I shouldn't be surprised that it doesn't appear to do anything. As other reviewers noted, it smells good and leaves your face feeling fresh- but after a month of using it twice per week, I haven't noticed any long term effects. My skin looks the same & is no more or less clear than it was. I'll use it all, but unless there are some noticeable benefits soon I will not purchase more."
"givenchy has long ago been forged into the minds of the multitudes as being beautiful smells of worlds beyond, and this cologne is no different. a scent that is subtle and light yet gripping and intense. very irresisible has citrus undertones and woodsy cast shadows with an animalistic draw that pulls from the primitive chocolatey uniqueness that it presents. as your lungs breathe it in the smell becomes spherical and twists about like a tootsy roll's rappers. it is sharp and dimensional all the while that it is aluring and attractive. i got the giftset and wasnt all that impressed at first, but after some time had passed i realized exactly how stand out this cologne is and have grown to love the capturing essence that it's originality presents. if you want an intimate scent that casts spells and makes lovers want to sink their teeth into the other's flesh, then look no more. this cologne is rich and unrelentlessly desirable."
Make sure you have a small dog...Big Dogs might choke on these if they get to anxious... But there are a ton in this box - a great value and they do whiten the teeth very well - see all the great reviews. Help your dogs teeth if you don't want to brush them like me.
"My grandmother gave my four-year-old daughter this game for Christmas. It quickly displaced Lion King as my daughter's favorite v-smiles game (and the favorite of my wife and I as well). Featuring Winnie the Pooh and all the other characters from this Disney classic, the game is both fun and educational.Basically, Pooh wants to hold a party for his friends but is out of honey. So the game's mission (in adventure mode) is to find jars of honey. Along the way, kids learn counting, the alphabet, and some basic spelling. There's also some secret levels to discover -- albeit not so secret that a four-year-old cannot find them.Overall, one of v-smiles best games, in terms of both fun and educational value."
I have only been using this for a couple months and it appears to work just fine with no side effects. I see the dog scratching a lot less and haven't spotted a flea since we started using it. I simple apply the medicine to the back of the dogs neck after a bath and then let it air dry. As simple as that. Can't beat the price online either. I got a six month supply for only $17.
"I finally got the product but unfortunately my 1 year old maltese refuses to eat her food. The powder is extremely bitter and it doesn't have the best smell, so I guess it repels her. Unfortunately I wasn't able to see the results, I wish the makers of the product would have added some kind of flavor so the fussy little dogs would be able to eat it too."
"Don't let the words ""blood orange"" scare you. This is the most amazing gentle wash ever created."
"I am hooked on the Anthony products. This particular cream is fantastic. Not oily, absorbs very well and feels great."
"I love this dryer, I was up north visiting my daughter who has a T3, I had forgotten to pack my dryer so I used hers. My hair looked limp and just terrible. My Remington T studio did a much better job on my hair than the expensive T3. I'm going to buy another one so I have a backup, I never realized how much I really loved this dryer until that trip."
This product is WONDERFUL! I loved it. I have a cocker spaniel and she had very long hair (and matted in some parts)and it worked really well. It cut the hair real short (which I like)and cut through the matted hair quickly and efficiently. I used it for a couple hours and it NEVER got hot. It was excellent!!
"I have had scars on the side of my head from acne for a few years now. When I first heard of Mederma I was skeptical that it would reduce the visibility of the scars that I've had for years, but I was so sick of seeing myself as 'scarface' when I looked in the mirror I was willing to give anything a shot. After I first began using the product, that area of my face began to turn red and it would flake off after about a half hour of application. I've been using Mederma for about 3-4 weeks now and the redness from using the product has stopped and best of all, the scars on my face caused by acne have been greatly reduced! I am going to continue to use Mederma for about another month but until that time I'm proud to say I'm not near as embarrassed in public, and I don't have to worry about showing my 'good side' any more. Mederma works, and I'm pleased with the investment I made via Amazon.com."
"It's a hairdryer. It blows cold air over a heating element and makes it hot. That hot air evaporates and carries away the water in your hair, making it dry. Hardly rocket science. It does all the above well.The ""ion"" function only works when the cold blast button is pressed, so I don't have to worry about where all those extra electrons hangin' off the negative ions will end up.The overall slow speed of the fan coupled with the diffuser makes a nice, safe warmer for cold winter feet, too."
"When Art Asylum originally gained the contract to make Enterprise and other Star Trek toys, I was more than a little skeptical for a couple of reasons. For one thing, I didn't think that a toy company whose reputation rested on making replicas of Eminem and other sort of fringe genre figures would be able to appreciate the delicate art of pleasing the very demanding (myself included) group of hardcore Trekkers out there.I was wrong. Art Asylum has done a superb job with the Star Trek contract, and has turned out the most beautiful set of toys I've seen, toys definitely meant for the 'adult collector' range of buyers. And this model of the Enterprise NX-01 is the jewel in the crown.I purchased it right away when it came out almost a year ago, and was immediately struck by the quality and detail of the design. Clearly the creators of this 'toy' were thinking about its potential as a display item as much as a toy -- the stand, for example, is much sturdier than the more flimsy versions that have come out with previous starship models and attaches to the ship in a clever and ingenious way.About the only downside to this model is there are some fit and finish issues which could have been improved, and to get the full effect, you have to download and attach some decals from their website. None of that has bothered me much, however, and I'm very pleased to own one of these for myself!"
"I have had Monopoly for a number of years. It is a timeless game for all ages. You roll dice and go around the board, buying properties as you go. If you land on someone else's property you pay them. If you are interested in this you probably would like some of the other versions of Monopoly also. They are more updated and you should probably get one of them."
I love all of these products!! I can tell a big difference in the texture of my skin after using the kit.
These cards are too cute. They are a high quality full set of playing cards with the most adorable pictures. It is nice that they even give the breed names on the top of each card. They represent each major breed. Any dog lover will love these cards.
"After trying a number of different pads over the past four years, we have found these to be the best choice. These pads are sturdy, do not leak, and are priced well. I'm not saying I'd ever try to use them myself, but in a pinch they just might do the trick."
"My dog has gotten older and can't 'hold it' all night, so I have started having to put down pads for her. These are great because they have the tape on the back to keep them in place."
"This toy was a hand-me-down from my sister. My daughter has played with it since she was 6M old. She was carrying it around the house at her 1 yr birthday party and dropped it. The toy broke into pieces! She obviously loved the toy, but it had to be thrown away because the jagged plastic couldn't be repaired or glued back together. I can't seem to find it anywhere, but here, on Amazon for an exorbitant price. What gives? Is this a typo? I swore it was [...] when I researched it before the toy was broken! The one we had was about 15"" long and maybe 4"" high? Is the one pictured here a much bigger toy? I hope someone can suggest an alternative if the price is really [...]!! If it is, then it's not worth it! Can you imagine your [...] smashed into pieces in one drop??"
"This is my favorite of all the Clinique fragrances, so I was extremely disappointed when they discontinued it. ""Simply"" is a great, light everyday fragrance with what I think is a hint of ""Good & Plenty""... when you smell it, you'll know what I mean. I'll miss it when I can't get ahold of it anymore!"
"The Gravity Wolf is a very interesting zoid. He has two wheels (the one in the front comes out and he looks like a motorcycle). You use the rip-cord to go through the gravity gear system (his main power system) and his wheels turn, making him roll along the ground. He looks great with my other wolf zoids."
"I love Copag cards and DaVinci cards. They never disappoint me. I highly recommend them.I really like the 4 color deck, as it feels like I am playing online poker!These cards are great."
"I was concerned when the package arrived, as there was a four inch tear in the box along with an empty round hole, suggesting to me that something else might have been supposed to be included. So I put the item together, and it didn't work. It turns out that, when the batteries were replaced, it is one of my grandson's favorite toys this season. I am sure he would give it a five star rating."
"I've used Neutrogena products for a long time and I really like the brand. I would say this isn't a moisturizer that I'd buy. I have really dry hands and this product didn't do much to help make them feel softer. The lotion is very runny and took quite a while to absorb, even though their bottle says, """"absorbs quickly."""" I do like that it's fragrance-free and doesn't contain mineral oils, though. It might be all right for moderate to dry skin, but not strong enough for severely dry skin."
"I registered for this item on my baby registry because it looked cute. Lucky for me some of my relatives actually used the registry because this was one of my gifts. I put it in the crib with my daughter when she moved to the crib (around 2 mos old) we would feed her, turn pooh on and before he stopped singing, she was fast asleep. By four months old she had learned to turn him back on if she woke up during the night(we could hear the music through the monitor) we woke up from this every once in a while, but usually it didn't even disturb us at all. We found that pooh had to go everywhere with us. We are a military family so we both live far from home, but pooh goes home with us on every visit. It works great because it provides her a piece of home when she sleeps and she is much happier waking up when pooh is with her. The nightlight makes it even better because we have just enough light to leave the room with without running into one of her many other items and disturbing her. This was something we couldn't live without."
This set combines the features of several other start sets. We enjoyed this tremendously. Truly enhances creative building skills of kids (and adults!).
"My daughter received this as a gift when she was 7 months and when she began trying to pull up, it would tip and often fall on her. She is a small baby, so it wasn't her size that did it. I had to eventually put it away until she was old enough to stand on her own, but now she loves it!!! She is constantly dancing to it, and the music isn't loud, annoying, or long. I would recommend this for babies who won't use it for balance. She did get her arm caught in it, but that only happened because she had stuck another toy (not the balls which are included) down in the middle and wouldn't let go of it !"
"i just bought this game today from k bee toys (for only $3!!!). i'm having a lot of fun with it but it's better for more than two players.but i'm still giving it a five even though there are onlyl two of us playing.it's fun for any simpsons fan and fans of games in general.the poster below gave a good overview of the game, but if i had to equate it to something, it's similar to gin rummy."
"I'm sure it works fine, but I decided I didn't want to use this for my dog and sent it back."
"This is a great toy! My 10 month old as well as my 3 and a half can't get enough of it. My baby chuckles out of sheer excitement whenever the ball pops out. Fun, educational and durable, what else can I say! I am really happy about this purchase! I am sure you will be too!"
"the board will not lay flat and this presents a real inconvenience. otherwise the game is wonderful and stimulating to the mind. As I said however, am disenchanted with the board construction."
"I have the blue costume version of this, sculpting and detailing is very good as is the paint work."
"Decent cologne. I have since moved on to bigger and better colognes with my favorite and thousands of other's favorite - Jean Paul Gaultier. However, this has a good standard scent that you can't go wrong with. It doesn't last as long as some of the more expensive colognes though. In my experience after using about 10 different cologne types/brands, you actually do get what you pay for. If you are wondering why the top ranked colognes every year are usually the most expensive, there is a reason for that. I would rank this cologne in the middle to lower-middle tier. Far better than some of the cheaper colognes but nothing compared to the higher tiers."
i was dissappointed in this item. it wasn't what i expected at all. It didn't have any push button features and had stick on decals. i had to pay 17.00 for shipping on top of the reg price and i was not happy with it. i bought my grandson a car at ames last year that had so many talking features and push buttons and really durable and payed the same price without the shipping. i had to order on line to get it in pink. I tried all toys r us and no one had it in pink.I kept it because my granddaughter who is one would not understand me taking it from her now. I would not recommend this toy and would not buy it in a store.
"When I first got this perfume I did not like it. It smelled like dull vanilla to me.I don't know what changed, if it was something in the condition of my nose or in the chemistry of the perfume. The thing is that after a few weeks I perceive its smell very differently. It is not dull vanilla anymore, but spicey candy. Now it is like a mix of cinnamon and vanilla, and I like it very much.The scent has long staying power and you need to spray only a small amount.I also like the perfume Passion, from Elizabeth Taylor.As for White Diamonds and Diamonds and Zapphires, I just cannot get to like those perfumes, no matter how many times I try them. Diamonds and Zapphires is the worst for me, it smells like a pungeant acid. I have to shower after putting it on because I cannot stand the sour scent of jasmine."
"Caesars Man Cologne is a high quality cologne is typically expensive. I, was however, able to find it at a reasonable please using Amazon!"
"I have had my conair flat iron for over 6 years and have never had a problem with it. I figured I was in the market for an updated flat iron so...I have been reading reviews for all of the flat irons. Price wasn't an issue, and honestly I didn't see much of a difference in price vs value. I brought home a Hot Tools flat iron, tried it and hated it! It pulled my hair and was really weird to work with. Tried the Chi, was good, but didn't love it. So I brought it back and decided to go with the pink Remington. I love that it has an automatic turn off in an hour if you forget about it. It displays the degrees digitaly and heats up super fast. It is so easy to manuever and the top isn't hot, so you can use your fingers/both hands to guide the iron and won't burn yourself. Best of all it works great and doesn't pull my hair. It was so smooth going down my hair. I am really glad that I did all of my homework on irons, although what I really learned was expensive doesn't mean that its' better...just more expensive. So I saved money buying the Remington Tourmaline vs a Chi and instead went all out on hair care products(Biosilk) and Hair Mask(Neutrogena Hair mask)etc.. to protect my hair from the heat. You have to buy them anyway no matter which flat iron you use, might as well get the good ones!"
"I bought a small and a medium for my cat and dog. Both pets took to the beds immediately.I think the key thing here is ""value"", these beds are a bit thin but they were very cost effective and the quality is reasonalby good. I worry a bit about my dog, she weighs about 50-60 (a lab) and I don't feel this provides much padding for her but it's definately better than laying directly on a hard floor. This being her 'indoor' back up bed, it is very easy to move around, or even wash so it serves my purpose very well. The whole bed is light and one piece, you just put the whole thing in the wash machine; I don't suspect it is going to last for ever but again, I think it was a good value.I gave it a 5 star due to the value, I realize this isn't the best bed but it is everything I expected and more at this price range."
"A lot of the muppets figures are expensive this is not the case i have more than 25 figures from palisades from $8 to $260 and every one of them are extremly detailed with a lot of gadgets and novelties, this one comes with a desk a little red phone, reading glasses and a Tv display with 6 stikers which you can put on the display you have to choose which stiker because there are only 4 spots, but every one of them is hilariuos, if you are a muppet collector GET It is worth it."
"I've had several types of litter boxes for my cat. All of which he scatters the litter everywhere. This fixes that easily. No more him playing with the litter and me having to clean up every other day. Also, I just bought this today at a Petsmart for $30.99 so you might want to check out your local Petsmart before buying online as they are discounted with a perks card."
"I successfully used this product to bring my two sickly rescued kittens to health quite rapidly. It was well tolerated, easy to serve and most importantly, it worked well. I gave each about an inch squeeze and one ate it when I put in in her mouth without her consent, while the other was waiting with an open mouth and always wanted seconds. :) I was able to get nutrients and sorely needed calories into the anemic kittens and their situation turned positive quickly, with them gaining weight and their fur filling in. The littlest one was 1.25 lbs and with taking this, eating well and a visit to the vet, she was over two pounds in short order. Now they both lie about, making up excuses why they don't have jobs and need to fall asleep everyplace the sun shines on."
I purchased the Curve Vintage and I received this item very quickly. Not only was I pleased with the size of the bottle for the price but I was pleased how it came packaged.
"I bought the medium size ball for my 20 pound beagle, and she had the treat popped out and completely eaten in about an hour. Won't be giving this to her again but I may try to put smaller treats INSIDE the ball..."
"My two cats love this. Not only is it more hygenic, it saves me time from constantly changing dirty water dishes. Everyone wins and it's fairly priced. Very happy with purchase."
I had an old version of this dryer for over 20 years and loved it. It went to 3 different homes with me. The one I just purchased doesn't heat up as much for drying/curling hair at same time. Have to use a curling iron now. Not happy about adding a step to morning routine.
"I purchased this toy for my Grandson's Birthday as he just loves Dinosaurs. When my shipment arrived I was initially shocked to see the size of the ""big"" tub of Dinosaurs which is the reason my overall rating was just 4 stars. My first thought was that I was glad I had not chosen to purchase the smaller package. That being said, the toy seems very interesting and I am sure he will have fun playing with the various pieces. I especially like that it comes in it's own storage compartment so overall I am pleased with my purchase."
"For years I've used those heavy metal six and eight panel gates inside my house for my four dogs. And while they do the job, they're heavy to move and always pinch my fingers and scratch my floors! What the heck took me so long to buy this very attractive, lightweight but durable gating? My four dogs (chihuahua and maltese) are all under 12 lbs so I got the 24"" height which is perfect. I did purchase the two extension panels to create a six-panel pen so I could put an XL wee-wee pad at one end (of the rectangle) and the dogs' water bowls at the other. I was, however, pleasantly surprised to see how wide the individual panels are (much wider than the panels on the metal gating) so the four-panel pen is actually quite roomy. If I didn't need to include a wee-wee pad, the four-panel pen would be more than sufficient for one or two dogs at a time. This pen is sturdy and easy to assemble and move about the room. Assembling the door latch is a bit tricky but a few minutes of uninterrupted concentration and it was done. Without question, this was a best purchase!"
"Other players -- master tacticians and fanboys obsessed with Puerto Rico -- can give you a far more technical and analytical review. What I would like to emphasize is that this is a game that is never predictable and never boring. The next game of Puerto Rico you play will probably be 180 degrees different from the last one. Yes, some people play it with laser-eyed intensity and an intolerance for the less-than-optimum move. But we normal people :-) can have a good time playing with our friends and still exercise our minds, sharpen our strategies and have a whole lot of fun. The creator of Puerto Rico must be an unusual person. The game he gave us is so well thought out, so finely tuned and perfectly balanced, that you never feel the outcome is decided halfway through, as in so many games where the player gaining an early advantage retains control for the rest of the boring, exasperating game. There are so many things going on, so many paths one may follow, that it's impossible to ""control"" this game. Which makes it a lot more fun. That's the main thing. It's great fun for intelligent people. And very well-crafted, too. The game boards are heavy, with attractive graphics and colors, and cute, simple little game pieces that are fun to handle. It feels like quality and adds to the pleasure. Without question Puerto Rico is the pinnacle as far as board games go. Not even Settlers of Catan or Princes of Florence can equal it."
"My 5 month old kitten had never used a covered litter box (to my knowledge) so I was nervous he'd be afraid to try it. Not only was he jumping in it while I was setting it up (he jumped in and used the base before I could get the cover on), I actually watched him make a decision to use it. I kept his old box so he could transition into this new one. He ran into the kitchen to his old box, stopped short, looked at the booda dome, back at his old box, and happily trotted into the booda dome. So cute! So I immediately took his old box away and he's been using his booda dome since. He's tiny, but he's got a lot of extra room in this box so I think it will be fine for when he's full grown. It really is a big box - way bigger than the traditional rectangle one I had. The only thing is I would NOT recommend buying the booda dome liners. They barely fit the box and come loose as kitty does his thing. I purchased these liners:Cat Litter Box Drawstring Liners 15-pk. - XLand the drawstring is great for keeping the liner in place and making the clean up job super easy. I highly recommend this box!"
"We have a bunny and it has been VERY difficult finding an appropriate play area for her. I have kept my childrens old plastic playpen, but when we set it up, our little bunny just squeezed through where the panels met. Needless to say, it didn't work. This one is AWESOME b/c we put it on a vinyl mat (that I also purchased when my kids were babies to play on) and I leave the door open, pushing the gate against the bunny barn and leave that door open also. It allows so much room for a little bunny. In the warmer weather, she can stay outside in the pen while my kids swim in the pool or chase each other around. We can also attach it to the Rabbit Run. I am extremely pleased with such a versatile item that can do so much more than expected!!! I would buy this again and again and also highly recommended it!!!"
"works well, my dog didn't like it very much at first, but he got used to it. it made walking him a lot easier"
"I am a holistic healer (Qigong healing [...].) and I am constantly looking for products that are good for Qi flow, therefore promoting good health. We test products in my workshops (Isn't Chi Lovely) and rate them from tested, good, great to awesome. [...]. When a product is rated good, great or awesome, it promotes Qi flow. This is the only sunscreen that is rated awesome. It is so good, it not only prevents me from getting tanned, I feel vibrant wearing it. This is the sunscreen that I recommend to the athletes who train at the Olympic training center. Silvia"
"This cream was recommended to me because I get horrible cracks in my hands every winter...I can be writing something, and realize that my skin has spontaneously split open and I am bleeding on the paper! I've tried all the super heavy duty hand creams out there, without notable success, but CeraVe healed my worst cracks in just a couple of days!"
"My fourteen year old son and I enjoyed this game. At first it seems terribly simple, but then visual strategies emerge. I liked it more than he did. A fine alternative to chinese checkers or mancala."
"My boys loved this toy and it did come with a few refill balloons. After they were gone, so was the toy. I couldn't find a balloon big enough to blow up the cover completely. Wish you could get refills. :("
"This toy rocks! It is incredibly simple but its randomness keeps it interesting for a very long time. The big red button is easy to find and press. The balls pop out with just enough speed, enough to send the balls flying but not hurt if the ball hits you in the face. My one year old has a great time finding objects to insert into the launch tube. Pens do not work :) However, the design is amazingly kid tolerant, nothing really damages it. I love how the dish and ramp are made of a softish plastic so when you (inevitably) trip onto it, it does not cause too much injury.The only problem I can think of is that it works best when it is very level, otherwise the balls do not roll back into the feeder. But even that is educational since my baby has learned to push the balls in when they are stuck.And it has good music. Great toy!"
This toy is the most annoying toy ever! We keep it in my daughter's playpen and the slightest touch to the playpen it starts talking. I think it is a good concept but my 1 year old doesn't even play with it. My four year old did for about five minutes. What a waste of money.
"Best toy I have ever gotten for my cat. I keep getting more because she does such a great job hiding them. She spends hours throwing them up in the air, then chasing them. Great toy. Easy to hold in her mouth."
Right now I have this mirror in her crib. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ties that tie it to the crib are really annoying... velcro would be better. My daughter loves the spinning ball and bats at her reflection in the mirror. It's a great toy for the crib and I'm sure she'll continue to enjoy it outside the crib.
"I purchased StriVectin-SD Intensive Concentrate for Stretch Marks in January. I decided to give the product a chance, being that I have heard rave reviews about it. After the first week of using StriVectin, my strech marks were smoother and so was the surrounding skin. I continued to follow instructions carefully, I even exfoliated three times a week, thinking this would also help the process. By the end of the month I noticed no change at all! I just had smooth strech marks, wtf? I decided after the sixth week if nothing happed, I would return the product. Just as I thought, after six weeks of using this product, I was disappointed to see that nothing changed. Don't waste your money, this is clearly for fresh stretch marks and companies should make it a point to say that."
My son got this stacking truck set as a baby gift. He was able to play with the trucks at about 6 months and they are still played with today (my son will be 2 next month). The overall durability of this toy is great; they look as good as when we got them even after lots of play and being taken along on many trips. I have not seen this toy in any store - so get it here while you still can! It has been a much used toy and I highly recommend it for your small child.
My dog's incessant barking stopped within minutes of putting this collar on.The mailman is no longer afraid to enter my yard because my dog is now calm and quiet. Hetold me he would love for all dog owners to get this collar so his job would be more peaceful.
I ordered these in the same size (small) that I always use. The new design on the diapers has a much bigger hole for the tail. She leaks straight through it. Wish they hadn't changed it.
"I can't say enough about the Omega Paw litter box. My friend was raving about hers, so I thought I would give it a shot. VERY easy to clean! I have two cats, and the large size is perfect for a two-cat household. We had two covered litter boxes before, and the Omega Paw takes up less space than our other two boxes did. You won't regret this purchase :-)"
The product is great except for the fact that the bowls could be larger. Having a large dog......she goes through the water very quickly.
"I just didn't take time to go through the process of returning the broken item. but, I bought the two because I wanted a matching set for the newly rescued cats."
Now I can throw the ball over the house my border collie loves it. She gets to run twice as far now. It's kind of long but it fits on top of the frig.
"I get more compliments on this fragrance than any other I have ever worn, from friends and complete strangers alike. I just love it! It smells clean and slightly floral, but not too much so. I don't agree with other reviewer that this smells like ""Grandma,"" and if it did, Grandma would have excellent taste."
"My 9 1/2 year old lab/chow has been on this for 3 weeks now and so far I have not noticed any improvement. I have him on rymadyl? for his hip and front paw and tried discontinuing it a few days ago, he seemed really miserable so I put him back on it. I will continue to keep him on this with the hope that I can stop the rymadyl and will update in a few weeks to let you know if I see any improvement. Also, he will not chew these so I break them up and put them in food.I also have put him on fish oil and glucosomine/condroitin pills.Update"
I initially started using this on my child for extremely dry skin and now our entire family uses it. It's the best on the market.
"This is the only brand of treats that my dogs will not only eat, but actually beg for. I've given these as gifts to my dog owner friends always to rave reviews...I love that they're all natural and good for them."
"I purchased a number of these ""look who's Talking"" toys for my bulldog and he just loves them. They not only make sounds appropriate to the animal (""polly want a cracker"" from the parrot; grunts from the pig, gobbles from the turkey, etc), they are also well made and stand up to a lot of chewing and throwing around. For some reason, they no longer make the entire menagerie, but I'm hoping that they will again sometime.Multipet Look Who''s Talking Dog Toy Parrot"
"I help sell Avon so I have seen the fragrances come and go but this one is a keeper. I use this one myself. It is a wonderful scent. I get compliments from people when I am out and about. Having gone thru many fragrances of Avons and also other companies, I can truly recommend this one. You won't be sorry you purchased it. You could also find a Avon Represenitive and try a sample. When you try it, all you will say is WOW! I found my new scent!"
Since the 25th april today is the 27 may I haven't the product. What happend?
"All 3 of our dogs love the various vitamin-enriched ""tasty pastes"" available from Kong. Although they loved to chew on their Kongs before, we found that they really got into it when we inserted some of the paste into the cavity. All of them go ""nuts"" when we put down the ""pasty Kongs"" for them to enjoy - and enjoy them they do!I would highly recommend all of Kong's ""tasty pastes"" - it's easy to use, doesn't seem to make any mess, and is a great extra treat for dogs. Our 3 give it ""2 paws up""!"
"This product seemed to cure my dog's worm problem; however, they came back within a month. It looks like we'll be making a trip to the vet."
This is a really tiny bottle but it has lasted me for about 4 months at this point. The pump is no longer of any use but it's easy enough to just get it out with the tube and put it around your eyes. I definitely lost a lot of the sagging bags under my eyes and I would recommend this product to anyone looking to do the same.
"This is a great addition to the playmobil pirate ship.The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that there are several little pieces like guns and swords, etc. that are really little. I am getting tired of stepping on them!"
"Having auburn hair other colors accentuate red in an unnatural hue. The ash brown color diminishes the red hue but does not seem to cover the gray as well aslight brown. Perhaps as one reviewer commented, leaving the product on for 20 minutes might prove beneficial. Check with the manufacturer first. This is a difficult color to locate. Sometimes Walgreens has it and sometimes they don't. Ask the manager of the cosmetics department to request the color from the distributor or buy a lot at one time."
"I have been using this lotion for more than a year, and I love it! It makes my skin feel so soft (but not greasy), and it diminishes the appearance of my fine lines. It's not a miracle worker, though. I wake up in the morning with no fine line on my brow but, since I furrow my brow throughout the day, they always return later on. I would (and have) recommended this product to others."
I absolutely love this body cream! The scent is refreshing yet subtle and lasts all day. I have been unable to find this particular scent in the store but have had great success finding it here on Amazon. I definitely recommend this product.
I have purchased this item and find it much worse then the small neopets toy. in one way the little one is actually handheld this thing is huge! if you want one that you can actually carry to places i suggest the small one. the kougra is the best hopefully you will follow me on not buying the huge ones.
"After using it once, I am just amazed. The moment I washed the product off and looked in the mirror, I thought to myself, WOW. My skin not only felt soft, but it looked like it was glowing. All the little imperfections in my skin were gone. LOVE IT!"
"I bought my three nephews one each. The 9 year old was the only one who was really into it. The others seemed to be disappointed it was just flashlights on some goggles. When i bought this i expected as much as i expected from a pair of x-ray vision glasses. So if anyone bought this product and was expecting to get night vision goggles they obviously had never ordered x-ray glasses, which are just as falsely advertised. But these are much more durable. My nephew dropped them half a dozen times crawling in the basement and they still work fine."
Una colonia delicada y con presencia.. muy rica. Recomiendo huelas antes en alguna el perfume que quieras comprar antes de hacerlo por aqui.
"The product is just fine - however, since this product is OIL - it should be checked well before shipping to make sure the screw top is tight enough to keep the oil inside the bottle. The box arrived with oil throughout - needed a major wipe down to set the bottle out for use."
"I use this product as a detangling conditioner before actually styling my bi-racial beauty's hair. It gives it a little sheen and conditioning, but you will definitely need to use another type of moisturizer for drier hair types. It does smell really really fantastic. To me, it is sort of a black cherry vanilla-almond type smell."
i used this perfume about 10 years ago and looked for till i saw it at amazon. i really love this product and what i got was exactly what i saw and expected. it is highly recommended for those who are connossieurs of perfumes.
"Revlon RV051C 1"" Tourmaline Curling Iron. First time I used it, unit kept turning off by itself. Would not stay on for more than 5 seconds. Returning it."
"I've been using Hartz training pads for years, but decided to try these Neat N Dry pads since it got such good reviews. These pads are much smaller then regular pads. Although the quality is great (edges all sealed), they are simply too small for my Pekingnese."
"I really like this toy for my yellow lab puppy. He really enjoys corners, and if he can find one, he will demolish it. Regularly shaped Nylabones last around a month. This ring has been super fun! He likes to play with it a lot because it's round, so he can stick his paw in to secure it, and then chew. It's very sturdy, but there is another version of it called the ""Gumabone"" for younger pups. I wouldn't go over 5mos with Gumabone products. This toy is really fun for dogs, almost indestructable, it's super!"
I love this conditioner. My hair looks and feels great. I also love the smell.
"What can I say, The Mobile is just adorable and well made, My new grandsonloves watching it go around, Fast Shippment!! Thanks....."
"I feel like I'm missing something - where do you keep the balls when it's not in use? They seem to disappear under couches, etc. when not actively being played with. This toy does too little to be worth the space it takes up and the money...get a shape sorter or something similar instead!"
"Purchased this for my new Morkie puppy. It is perfect. Even when not using as a pen, I can use the panels to block off doorways where I don't want her to go. It arrived in a timely fashion and is used daily."
My son loves this activity center. It is the first toy of it's kind that my son will stay in longer than 15 minutes at a time. He goes crazy jumping in it. I haven't had the paint chipping problem mentioned in one of the previous reviews- and my son definitely chews on just about every part!
My dog hasn't really taken to this yet. It's smaller than I expected and it's so heavy that she's afraid of it at the moment.I think I would have been better off getting a lighter-weight frisbee.
I bought this for Christmas for my grandaughter because she asked for it. I assume she will be happy with it.
I purchased this product for my 28 pound miniature golden-doodle. He played with it for hours after getting it. The toys lasted about 2 weeks before my dog started ripping out the stuffing from the squirrels. I wish the squirrels were made a little better to last longer as my dog really enjoyed playing with this toy.
"I bought the campfire, teepee, canoe, mother, buffalo, totum pole, medicine man and others for my eight year old grandson last Christmas. They were studying various indians in school and he was facinated. These figures are exceptionally well made, although pricy. My grandson did not let his brothers (ages 5 and 3 at the time) play with them for quite a while, but I noticed they all had them out and created an indian village and included Lincoln Logs. They had a history lesson from their older brother."
"For reasons unknown to me, my dog had decided he needed to announce to the world that the backyard was his domain. Apparently the proper method for doing this was to stand at the top of a hill in the backyard at 10:30 at night and bark until I yelled at him to stop.It didn't take long for me to tire of this, so I purchased the bark collar. My dog figured it out right away! Barking == spraying, spraying == bad.I've found it's only taken a couple of days and he's completely stopped his night time proclamations.The barking behavior has completely stopped.Oh and as an added benefit, he had a nice lemony smell after his sessions with the collar."
was very excited and pleased with purchase and how fast I received it. the collar is beautiful. the only alteration I would Have added is a place in front of collar to attach fancy ID tag I purchased but I worked It out. Thank you keep good work.
"I discovered this hair cream in college over 11 years ago. This is the hand-down BEST texture/shine/hold paste out there. Better hold than a pomade. Smells nice but not sissy-smelling, adds great control and shine without looking like it's greased up or 'wet'. Not crunchy like a gel or greasy feeling like a pomade. Many guys use American Crew pomade. That stuff is utter crap compared to this. Get this stuff, you won't regret it."
Bought this arcade when my daughter was 6 mos. old. She started out pushing the balls through with her hands. She watched her 18 mo. old cousin use the hammer and she caught on. She loves the lights and music and has continued to play with this toy several months later. It's good for hand and eye coordination.
I loved this game when I was younger and ordered it for my children. But... this game is so cheaply made now! A thin cardboard bottom has the graphics (comes seperated not integrated) and rips VERY easily. The popper is of a thin bent metal tension design that doesn't pop reliably. Very frustrating! We ended up buying a vintage game on [auction site] and love it!
This product works. My lab has been shedding horribly and the Furminator has really helped to remove her undercoat.
My boxer loves this toy. We hide treats in the tulip and then put the ball on top of the treat inside the tulip. He loves getting the ball out and finding his treat. The ball also squeaks and he loves to carry it around and have us put the ball inside and toss it. Double Fun
My daughter loves this toy-she plays with it all the time!I agree that it's insanely noisy but after a couple rounds you tune it out.It's given her lots of practice with her motor skills and she loves the monkeys behind the door-she loves to peek-a-boo them.
"So I brought this product on a whim. I started looking up products to help clear blemishes. I came across this product and read a couple of reviews and decided to purchase it. After moving from Austin, TX (dry climate) to Baton Rouge, LA (very humid) my skin went crazy. I had some breakouts that were stubborn and hard to treat. I bought this product because I have oily, blemish prone skin. After the first two or three applications my skin started to improve drastically, let's also take into account that my skin had started to improve on its own given the fact that I had been here for a couple months. It does an EXCELLENT job treating acne before it actually occurs. If you feel sore spots on your skin but there is no raised bump yet, this is perfect for that cause they'll never actually erupt into a breakout if treated with Bye Bye Blemish. Even though I have oily skin I ONLY use it once a day and at night. It can cause excessive drying but I have FOLLOWED the directions so I have not had this problem. It has faded my blemishes also, but I believe that its strength lies in treating acne. It can prevent breakouts and with proper moisturization your skin can heal and you can prevent blemishes from occurring. Also, I do not use the product everyday because it can cause extra drying when used properly. I use an oil free moisturizer daily and sometimes I will give my skin a day off so that it can heal on its own between treatments. Some reviews discussed how the product smells. It's not bad at all. The most important aspect of it all is that it actually WORKS. All you need to do is follow the directions and create a reasonable regimen that works for your skin."
"When I read the reviews of this cat toy, I was skeptical. I mean ... c'mon ... feathers attached to fishing pole? How creative.Little did I know, my kitty would think this was the best thing EVERRRR.She played so hard that she actually started panting. And even when she's on the verge of having a kitty heart attack, she STILL wanted to play with it! At this point, I had to put it away - hid it in a closet - and she STILL kept at it, trying to open the closet door.Do not let your cat play with this toy unsupervised, if he/she's anything like my Gremlin, he/she will DESTROY this toy. As in, eat the feathers. Om nom nom. So yeah, be sure to put the toy away or else you will be going through attachments like water.As for the fiberglass splinter issue ... again, don't let your kitty nibble on the wand. I covered the handle part with electrical tape to prevent splintering."
First the thumb on the sword hand broke off. Then one of the other fingers broke off.This was right after taking the toy out of the packaging. It's not a very good likeness of Kain and not the sturdiest of figures. Do yourself a favor and hunt down one of the figures that was released along with the first Soul Reaver game.
"I have been using Nioxin products for a few years. My hair is very fine and I have hard water......the combination leaves my hair feeling/looking terrible. I don't know if it actually ""thickens"" a person's hair....however it does leave my scalp feeling great and my hair looking full because as all of the gunk has been efficently removed.If in doubt, give it a try for your self and decide. This large bottle lasts me approximately 4 months (I generally wash my hair once a day)."
"Let me first start with the fact that I have six cats. Three of them have long hair. The Cat Genie says it is recommended for up to three cats. It was very easy to get the cats switched from the conventional litter box to the Cat Genie, it worked just as the instructions said it would. There have been very few accidents, and these only happen when the unit gets plugged up. I like the Cat Genie a lot, but with as many cats as I have, I have to take more care of it than someone with fewer cats. At least once a week, it plugs up. When this happens, I have to disassemble the entire thing, this is not a hard task but it can be messy. About half the back ups are due to the permanent litter getting into the drain opening and stopping things up. The other half of the time, it is hair. The literature recommends brushing your cats frequently, and they mean it!I would make a couple of design changes if I were the manufacturer. I would put some kind of scraper at the top of the rim to scrape the permanent litter off the rim of the rotating bowl when it backs up behind the scoop. Or I would change the angle of the scoop so that the litter wouldn't back up to the top of the bowl rim. I would also put an abort button on the unit to stop the cleaning cycle when the unit gets plugged up. Too much of the permanent litter ends up in the inner workings of the Cat Genie, which contributes to the clogs. Most of the litter than ends up inside is stuck to the scoop and gets shaken off into the solid waste hopper. Perhaps a few more shakes before the solid stuff gets dropped into the hopper. It would be nice if I could set it up to clean more than four times a day. I frequently run manual cycles to keep up with the output of my six cats. Again, the Cat Genie is very clear in its literature that it is designed for up to three cats. I am pushing the envelope with six.I like the Cat Genie, but it needs a couple of tweaks. I am so happy not to have to clean a conventional litter box and deal with the litter and litter dust all over the house. No lingering smells either. I'm not sure how the cats feel about it, but they seem to want to use it and they are no longer afraid the the noise."
i jus came to day lucky me lol i jus started useing it and wow i can feel and see a difference in my skin i love it
"After watching the movie Zathura, we were very excited to play this game. However, the game is so poorly constructed we couldn't even play it. The cards in the console do not come out, and the spinner, which you are supposed to ""spin"" on your turn, does not spin at all, barely moving from one number to the next. I suppose you could play this game with a dice and simply turn the cards over, but it would not be as fun, and would certainly not feel like you were playing the game as displayed in the movie."
"I'm in my late 20s and a lifetime nail / cuticle biter. I bought this product not because my hands looked nasty (although they did), but because I was told (twice) that my incessant nail biting was making me look incredibly unprofessional during meetings and actually impacting my career. Yikes!This product has cured what endless amounts of money spent on manicures couldn't fix - it's been about 3 weeks and my hands don't even go near my mouth. I'm rating it 4-stars based on a few caveats:1) I didn't read carefully and was surprised when the 3 containers arrived - they were tiny! Each container holds 0.25 oz which is a lot less than what I imagined based on the product picture. It's no big deal, you don't need any more.2) The horrendous taste lasts for a while, but they do wear off after washing your hands. I found that the taste became ""manageable"" for an addicted biter after about 3 washes. Be prepared to reapply throughout the day.3) The cream is quite sticky. I'd apply and then have to wash my hands to remove the stickiness - which obviously counts towards your 3 washes mentioned above.4) It could actually impact your meal choices as finger foods become a non-option.Side note"
"Received my Spornette 25 as a gift to replace my Sponette 20 which I have used daily for over 20 years. Though slightly larger, it's great!"
"Great product that just works as described... With two cats we use it at least once a day. Hope the bags last long, but only time will tell. Fast shipping too. Thanks amazon."
I like this toy very much it is very fun and cool!the only thing i don't like is that the wip cord is hard to put away so i don't use it that much.overall GREAT TOY! very cool!
"This stuff works better than anything you'll find at the big box stores and unlike with foggers, it goes where you want it and not on surfaces were it doesn't need to be. If you have an infestation though it will not work by itself, no product will. You have to treat your pets with advantage or a similar product and then thoroughly clean all of your carpets, bedding, upholstered furniture, drapes etc. before spraying this product. After spraying you have to continue to vacuum the entire house thoroughly at least every other day for a week or two to break the life cycle. This is the same product that pest control companies use and they will ask that you do all of the cleaning mentioned above before they'll treat your house. You may as well save some money and do it yourself."
"I read reviews saying the bone lasted their big dogs quite some time. I just receive the bones 2 days ago, and with in the 2 days my dogs had them completely cleaned out and bare. I have two very tiny Shih Tzu mix dogs. No where near big dogs. I'm very disappointed how fast they went through 2 bones. The delivery was very fast that's why I'm rating it a 3 star otherwise I would give it a 2."
collar is sized appropriately however the fabric is quite stiff. Ordered large enough sizes for my little dogs so it isn't a problem but be aware that material is stiff enough not to bend.
Doesn't super duper lighten but is subtle. Hair was a nice color for summer and very shiny. Would recommend!!!
"I'm a teenager with acne-prone skin, and an unfortunate amount of hyperpigmentation. It didn't really do much for me- it made my skin a bit smoother, but overall no big change in skin tone. I'm sure it works well for some, but not really for me. It did smell nice and was quick, so there's that!"
"DUDE! I WOULD OF GAVE IT 105 STARS IN EVER CADAGORIE BUT THE LIMIT IS 5! This thing rocks man! My brother& sister have beyblades to, they're BIGGER then mine.....BUT I SURE BEAT THEIR BLADES UP! ONE TIME MY BROTHER'S FELL APART! SO YOU PROBALY THINK ''WHY GIVE IT 5 IN EDUCATIONAL?'' WELL SOMEONE HAS TO BE THERE TO TEACH US HOW TO BRAKE THE CHINA! HA HA ! (BAD JOKE I KNOW I KNOW) BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW THAT YOU SHOULD BUY THIS BLADE! P.S. ITS NOT HOW MANY TIMES YOU FALL DOWN IN LIFE, ITS HOW MANY TIMES YOU GET BACK UP AGAIN."
"Just want to give you a little of my hair background...I was suffering from grown out roots and some left over red semi-permanent dye in my hair...basically technicolor hair (eww)! My main color is my natural color-Dark Ash Blonde/Light Ash Brown, then there's Blonde in my bangs and on the side of my head, and Black underneath, plus some residual color left over from experimenting with Red semi-permanent dye.So I decided to dye my hair, all except the Black and some of the Blonde on the side, a Light Ash Brown color to camouflage the exposed roots. This made my natural color golden/brassy :\!! I def wasn't going to have this fixed at a salon because of $$, so I immediately began research on a good color correction shampoo and found Shimmer Lights. I consulted with a friend who's a hair stylist and she, too, recommended this.I washed my hair with this shampoo and after the first rinse I saw some of the residual red color come out-it had been in my hair for six months! It also made the blonde brighter, which was expected. I noticed a slight difference in the brassiness, but not much so I repeated and left the lather on for 5 minutes...still didn't notice much change. After I repeated a Third time for 15 minutes, my hair appeared better with barely any brass tone.I have fine hair and noticed that this shampoo def dries out the hair-I think you're only supposed to use it like once a week. Just much sure you thoroughly condition your hair after this! I didn't buy the matching conditioner-just used a lot of my regular Suave stuff. My hair feels nice now because of the conditioner plus I skipped a day of washing. Also, the smell is kind of nice-it's floraly.I now have used Shimmer Lights a Fourth time to try and achieve my desired tone. My hair looks soooo much better!! I plan on dying it darker for the Fall, but for now I'm satisfied :) I would definitely recommend Shimmer Lights Shampoo to peeps!"
"Smells too strong and very jasmine on me, gives me a headache. Just goes to show that one should definitely spray on their own skin first before ordering =)"
"This chess computer is good for anyone who is not enough experienced in the chess game and wants to learn more, if you are an experienced player look for a different computer this one will not challenge you. Overall it has good quality and you will have a good time if you like to play chess."
This is the only dog treat that my terrier will eat. We crumble over his dry food and he LOVES it.
"This is my all time favorite perfume, this is the one that I wear everyday. I get many compliments on it and LOVE IT!!!!!!"
"This review is for the Coconut Hand and Body Lotion. The Shikai lotions are nice on the skin and they are thicker like a body butter or body creme. I also appreciate that they do not use parabens and the like. There IS a Coconut scent to this one but it is more of a soft Coconut/Vanilla scent. Very pleasing, however as there is no real coconut oil in the product that was dissapointing. (Could be do to the fact that coconut oil does not have a long shelf life and Shakai opts out of many of the more toxic preservatives.) They do have some great healing ingredients like wheat germ, avacado oil, shea butter and borage seed oil, however due to the fact that the lotion IS PURE WHITE and none of these listed ingredients in their more natural - AND MOST BENEFICIAL STATE - are white in color then it is obvious that they have heavily refined the ingredients leaving only a fraction of the botanical actives from many of these fabulous plants. Still has a nice aroma and leaves the skin soft for a couple of hours at least.(Will not last on supper dupper dry skin. For that you will need a quality unrefined body oil or body butter, or just use 100% virgin coconut oil!)"
"This bed is pretty nice, especially for the price. It has 2 removable zippered bags full of cedar shreds and a foam pad on the inside. I took some of the cedar out to make it a little less firm. My dog smells nice whenever she gets up from this bed. The top pad is some sort of fleece that takes some work to clean.I'd recommend it, I've got 2!"
"I've tried a number of scents over the last few years as people in my circle of family and friends have told me to get over my long time love affair with Lagerfeld. Alas, none of them could hold a candle to Lagerfeld in my book, and I'm not one to change for the sake of change.I forget how I came upon the sample of Image, but I tucked it in a drawer for more than a year before I tried it. Then I kept trying it until I emptied the little sampler, and ordered a bottle from Amazon. From the handsome bottle and very creative and unique sprayer to the smooth and richly sophisticated scent, I absolutely love it as much as I love Lagerfeld (maybe more?). I disagree with the product description of the scent. I prefer to describe the scent as understated manliness."
"We have discovered that if you only put 1/2 the deck into the machine at a time, it works a lot better. (The downside being that you have to restock them more often) We too are having a ""fit"" to find replacement cards. ARE YOU LISTENING MATTEL?This game is one that the whole family will enjoy...It is a blast!!!"
"This is a great toy! I usually do not like electronic toys, because I want to be the one teaching my babies, not electronic toy. But, this one is different. It's great. This is a toy that you and your baby use together. I bought this for my daughter who was 20 months old. She loves it. The best cartridge for her age is the one called Baby Words (or simular to that title) and has a picture of a baby on. It has the funniest game that is a song that goes to a popular tune and goes &quot;find the shirt, find the shirt (then baby presses the shirt) thank-You for finding the shirt&quot;. It's so funny! My older children LOVE playing this game with their baby sister. The books are sturdy. The toy is great. It's not really a toy that baby can play much on his/her own. It provides fun for both baby and Mom/Dad together. And lots of fun for an older sibling to play with baby with. There are 3 different levels that grow with your child. Highly reccomend!!"
My grandson was playing with the locomotive and no one knows how but the skin between his thumb and index finger got caught between the wheel and the frame. Seems he may have picked it up from the top when the wheels were going around. He is only 20 months old. When he started screaming my duaghter ran in to see what the problem was. She could not get his hand out. Thankfully my son in law was home and she screamed for him and it took his strength to pull the wheel away from the frame to get his hand out
The hard blue balls are suppose to act like a separator for clothes in your dryer with the knubby surface. They soften as they get hot. They do not shorten the drying time.All you are left with is blue balls and people who will be laughing at you while the manufacturer does so all the away to the bank!
"I have re-adjusted the screws on this pet barrier four times and my dog can still move it to jump over it! She doesn't do it while we are in the car, but if I have to leave her in the car while I run in to the store or something, she can move the barrier. It's very difficult to get a screwdriver in to tighten the barrier enough. I am trying to find a new barrier that my dog can't move!"
"This is certainly a cute toy and Lexi was excited to see it. She's a mid-sized dog, my roommate's ""Golden Doodle"" for those who follow hybrid breeds.To be fair, she does chew through toys pretty quickly, I had just hoped this one would be different given the reviews. Also, technically it's not the KONG material that tore, it appears to be the stitching around the bottom that she ripped through. And the stuffing that came out was not the mess that some toys have, it was actually an inner plush pouch, with a squeaker inside, that came out, so the toy is still usable... at 20 hours and counting... if it doesn't come apart any further it'd be acceptable in this state.I feel odd posting this rating since all the other reviews are 5 stars. We might try another KONG toy, maybe the snake. The thing was only $8 with shipping, and she's certainly enjoying it for as long as it lasts, so I can't give it a 1.About our prolific little chewer, she won't chew on rubber or plastic toys, she's just not interested. She does seem to love plush toys, especially with faces on them. If folks have any advice, I wouldn't mind an email. She does really enjoy plush toys, they seem to make her so happy, that it's worth trying to find another one."
"This is NOT anywhere near as good as the Lite Brite I remember from childhood. Generally companies aim to improve thier products over time, but apparently Hasbro is only concerned with selling refill packs so that the poor child who gets stuck with this piece of junk can play with it more than 10 times. Gee, thanks. Now for an additional [...] my kid can enjoy his toy an additional 15 times. Real generous Hasbro. That's right -- the ""flat screen"" is really only black pieces of paper that you attach to the screen with the pegs, and once you've put a peg through the paper you cannot remove it without leaving a big, white hole. This leaves no room for error or change, something that was really frustrating for my son -- so much so that halfway through his first picture he asked if we could take it back to the store. Also, there's no ""On/Off"" switch. You turn it on by pressing a button, then 3 minutes later it turns off on it's own. How stupid is that? And the little compartment at the bottom that is used to store the pegs is IMPOSSIBLE to open. There is no way a child could get it open -- which could have been done on purpose, so that younger siblings don't get into and snack on the pegs -- but every time my husband or I manage to pry the thing open the pegs fly everywhere. Not cool. You'd think they could have come up with a better baby-proofing solution than that. I can't seem to find any of the classic style Lite Brites, so I may try to take the thing apart and paint the background black -- I figure I couldn't possibly make the thing more useless. Trust me"
"This toy is sosososo cool. I've gotten 203!! that's my hi score. But after a while it resets the hi score so when you tell people you got a really good score, you don't have proof!!! and when friends come over they LOVE to use it and it is really addicting so they never want to play with me. But those are the only cons... This game is REALLY REALLY REALLY addictive, so you'll never want to stop. Most people think VoxBop is easier, but I think BeatBop is easier. BeatBop is easier once you know which one is which. Great for long carrides! And if it Distracts the driver... No worries! i has a headphone jack!!! this game can keep people (including the most impatient people ever!!) busy!!! YOU SHOULD DEFENITLY BUY THIS!!!!"
We got this after Christmas for my son and both he and my 4 year old daughter love it. They both love music and play with this as much as they can. I like all the different modes on the piano and the extras it comes with. My son grabs at the sun all the time as it moves and has never had his hand pinched. It is also very sturdy and has never toppled over when my son pulls himself up with it.
"Our daughter LOVES this toy. She received it when she was 3 months and is now 10 months. She plays with it everyday. &#60;br /&#62;She loves the music and lights. I wish she could press the letters herself, it is kinda hard to do -you have to keep the ball still as you push. Regardless, it is a great toy. This was the first toy she could really use on her own. She loves to spin the ball and watch and listen. I love the 2 volume options. The low is perfect. &#60;br /&#62;We'd replace it if it ever died. We are still using the batteries that came with it 7 months later!"
"The moment of Astro Boy's revival by the kindly Dr. Elephant of the Science Institute is brought to wonderful three-dimensional life in this toy that I would have given half my comic collection for when I was seven years old. The design of the cyclotrons is right out of the most recent incarnation of the durable anime series, & all the waldoes are moveable, plus there's spring-loaded plates on the table to pop Astro up to a sitting position after he's been re-energized. As sleek & hip a collectable as any of the new wave of adult collector J-toys, but cheap enough so you can buy an extra one for your kids so they too can tune into the vibe of one of the greatest comic/cartoon characters of the 20th -- and 21st -- century. Splurge on the just-released complete set of the 2003 version of the series for everybody in the family to enjoy, & you'll really be a hero!"
"I love this cologne, and have only been able to find it at a reasonable price through Amazon. Only problem with this particular shipment is that the bottle sprayer stopped functioning after about 10 uses. Although I can no longer spray from the bottle, I've taken the top of any can dab the cologne on.Not a major problem, but would be happier if it was still spraying."
"I bought 2 for my twin 3 year old boys. They have been dropped many times and still work. The LCD and picture quality is not great but I didn't buy this for quality picture taking! I bought them because my boys like to just take tons of pictures. The only draw back is that after it fills up, you have to go through and delete pictures one by one on the camera. I wish it had a delete all function. It takes longer to delete 50 pictures than take them."
"I have a labrador retriever. He weighs 82 lbs. He loved the bone, but I made the mistake and allowed him to eat the bone in one sitting. It was too much of a shock to his digestive system. The next morning he developed diarrhea. I' m not sure if the bone is the reason the diarrhea lasted so long, but to be causious I will not buy the bones again. To be fare about the product, I bought three of the bones and the last one was the one associated with my dog's problem, but of course that last bone is the only one he eat in one sitting. I believe the product would be best for larger dog's than mine, or for smaller dog if the owner regulator the amount of the bone that is eaten at each sitting ."
"The smell is strong and natural, but fades fast. I have combination skin and use it both day and night. I decided to use it after a peel. I am loving the results. My skin glows, is tighter, and looks very youthful. I apply a SPF moisturizer over it during the day and a cream moisturizer (Alba) over it at night. I do not wear powder makeup. In fact my only makeup is a tinted moisturizer. Moisture, moisture, moisture. That's what keeps skin young. It gives my skin a dewy glow."
These sleeves are top of the line. We use them all the time for our trading cards which we value very much. A most have for cards.
"These card protecters do two great things. First, the most inportant they protect your cards from liquids,scratches, and corner bends and possibley even more things depending on the enviroment of your playing area these are a great buy and definatly worth the moneyFor Example I while playing once spilled soda and my cards in which i had paid so much money for i thought were ruined but nothing got through the protectorsand also when you shuffle without protecters you might bend the your cards or after handling your cards for a while the cornors might start to wear which brings down the price and appearence of your cardslast of, those card protecters are really shiny and they look nice. With all that said I hope i have conviced you to buy these protectors because my experience with them has been amazing"
"I learned how to play SET in school, and it was very addicting! My friends and I would play it at Recess, and at Lunch, if there was time. I got my own SET cards and I play them a lot! It's very good for your brain. I recommend it!"
"When i ordered it, came very quickly, in time for my trip to The Caribbean islands!! Great service!! Will use them again!!"
"Heats up get quickly. Cord rotates 360 and is long,enough to accommodate all needs. Love the variable heat option. Don't think you can go wrong with this!"
"i bought this for my second granchild. the first one had his own and i was very impressed with it. the toy is useful for a long time from sitting up to 18 months. it seemed to help development while entertaining. it requires interaction, movement and provides fun."
If you have a dog or a cat this product is a must to have! I have four cats in my home and I used to have to vacuum my furniture and carpet twice a day! Now I just have to brush my cats for a few minutes whenever they jump up on my lap. You would not believe how much hair these brushes get out of them. It gets the undercoat also.
"I love this scent, I love the smooth, silky lotion and use daily! The new packaging is perfect as the previous was the oddest shape and didn't hold as much. I have so many compliments on this scent, and it lasts all day!"
This product was suggested to me from a cosmetic company owner to use in the morning with just water so as not to dry out my skin...it works great!
"Good questions without getting too personal. Good play, you can play as many rounds as you have interest for. The more the better (found that with 4 players, it got a little easy to guess who answered what). Quickly, one person is the ""host"" for the round, the others answer a question, pass their answers secretly to the host, who then reads them off while the others try to guess who answered what. Surprising how many you get wrong, great way to get to know people."
"My son loves it. I love it. We have 3 of these. I bought one here that was defective, contacted Amazon, they shipped a replacement out that same day by overnight. Stuff happens, Amazon fixes the issue. I love the lightsaber. Always wanted something like this as a kid, now I have a kid that wants one...I am still a total geek or what? The lightsaber rules! The old extend yourself that we have seem so plain now...."
"This is the best board game I have ever played, by far. It takes a little time to get comfortabale with the rules, but once you start playing you'll have trouble stopping. For 4-6 players (though I was able to play with more). The format is simple but effective:you read out a question (e.g. what is you favorite food)? Your friends answer the question and you have to match each player with the answer. (It's a little more complex when you land on reversals, but you'll figure it out soon enough).I promise hours of enjoyment. Get this game ASAP. I love it!"
"WOW! I love this game! There are a lot of great games out there these days, especially with the new European style games becoming more available in the US. Even amongst all these games, Ricochet Robot ranks up there as one my favorite games of all time. This is mental stimulation at its best!I have to admit that this game is not for everyone and I have a hard time finding people to play this game with due to its brain-draining nature. It does not have the strategic or tactical depth of chess, but it is on par for mental stimulation.The best way to describe this game is; a MENSA logic puzzle in a board game."
"This outfit looks totally cute in the picture. However, it is difficult to put on your dog and does not stay on. It is mmade of thin, flimsy material. I am very upset and do NOT recremend the purchase of this product!"
This product didn't do much for me. I still have bumps and ingrown hairs and the tiny bottle cost $25 and took forever to receive. Not worth it.
"Our dog loves this dog food. But, after my experience with ordering this product online through Amazon the dog may not get it again, as I am not only upset with Amazon for allowing it, but also the manufacturer who passes on their damaged cans to the public through an online site. I ordered a case of this product and every can in the shipment has large dents in the can. And because of the location of the dents, on the inside cans, in the packaging, you can tell it wasn't damage done during shipping. These cans we packed that way. Never again will I order anything like this online. It has actually soured me on using Amazon."
"I use this leash when walking my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel - we leave in a rural area and this gives him a chance to roam a bit but then it is also easy to bring in should there be a car. I've had one for about a year, and it's about time to buy another. The one we have is still fine, but looking a bit frayed."
"Although my girl is 16 months old, she hasn`t had fun with it yet. It is very hard for her to make it shake or say the words (numbers or colors)Sometimes she shaked a lot, and she doesn`t have any response.... it`s frustrating....I love leapfrog toys, but I`m very disappointed with the maracas."
"Oxygene by Lanvin a great scent for every day use. I was getting tired of the usual EDT's in my repertoire and decided to look for something different. I got this first as a sample and liked it right away, bought the biggest bottle and I have no regrets. Although having a very musculine scent, it is very subtle and not strong. Perfect for every day use. And at this price, its also easy on the budget without compromising a good choice."
"We bought three of these for Christmas--what a HUGE disappointment. They do not fly worth a darn. One never ever got off the ground. The two that did fly could not be steered or controlled. They were endlessly bashing into the ceiling and then plummeting to the floor. They seemed fun for a few minutes until it became apparent that it was not a question of learning how to fly them--they just stink! Within two hours, the blade on one helicopter broke off after hitting the wall. All three went back to the store.Skip this one and get the Syma S107Syma S107/S107G R/C Helicopter - Bluefor about the same price. It's a MUCH better helicopter. You can steer it, control how high it flies, maneuver around the house--even under tables and chairs. The Syma helicopter even lands rather than crashing! I can't say enough good things about the Syma helicopter."
"This is a great idea--the gravity-driven water fountain. So much better than plugging another device into the grid. However, it is hard to clean and refill because unless the bottle is empty, it spills when you pick it up or move it. So there are improvements to be made, but overall it's better than a bowl on the floor."
I bought this for my 10 month old for Christmas. This is his FAVORITE toy! He loves to pull the little guitar on it and dance/groove. It is the cutest thing you have ever seen. We've had it for a little over a month and LOVE IT!!!
Our games group enjoyed this game very uch. We enjoy the domino related games and this was a new twist for us.
I purchased two of these for my 15lb Cavalier after checking out a lot of products at major pet/grocery stores. The stainless bowl is removable so you can easily clean it or put leftover food in the fridge. That also makes it much easier to clean. The base is heavy enough that he doesn't tip the bowl or push it all over the floor.
"FURminator deShedding Tool for Cats, 1.75-Inch EdgeI haven't done a complete grooming with the Furminator, but I love it already. I have two shorthaired cats, and the one who has a fairly slick coat, with a moderate undercoat, loves getting brushed. The other, whose fur is more like a British Shorthair's - short but very thick & plush, and a really thick undercoat - disappears as soon as she sees a brush, no matter how soft. I've tried a slicker brush, the ZoomGroom, a regular hairbrush, and the soft grooming brush on her. She's fought all of these. So I wasn't too hopeful when I tried a few strokes with the Furminator as soon as I got it out of the package. Surprise! She merely glanced over her shoulder at the first stroke, then ignored it when I continued. For a cat who struggles to get away from any attempt at brushing, this reaction was a big relief. And even the few test strokes got out a lot of hair. Hurray! Now I can take care of her properly, just in time for spring shedding. The tool's easy to hold, with a nice ergonomic handle; has a handy blade protector that snaps on and off easily; and the blade is narrow enough to easily get into tight spots. Hardly takes any pressure at all while you're grooming, and it got out a lot of hair, even for the brief time I was testing it out. Very happy!"
My cAT really loves this cat dancer. I lost the first one we had and have never been able to find one since. thankyou.
"I purchased two of the Johnny Cash Action Figures,One for my sister and one for me.We both collect Johnny Cash.This figure is of great quality and looks just like Johnny ,created from a classic picture taken of him in his younger days.The service was great."
This hairspray is fantastic for a strong hold on your hairstyle. I am very picky about smells and this one smells great. I had used this on my wedding day and it lasted all day long!By Framesi Mist Hair Spray Strong (Aerosol) (10 oz.)
I saw a lot of advertising about the FURminator and thought I'd try it. I'm glad I did! I've used it on a rough collie (long hair) and on my greyhounds. I'd recommend this product to anyone with a dog.
"This stuff works! We've tried tons of products over the years, but this really did the trick!! Worth every penny. :)"
My daughter received this book with her new pink Leap Pad for her 4th birthday. I thought it would go the way of all her other electronic toys and be played with for a few minutes and then put aside. I was wrong - the Princess activity book has held her attention for several weeks now and she plays with it for 20-25 minutes at a time (an eternity to a 4 year old!). She loves to play the games and especially enjoys when the princesses talk just to her and ask her questions. This has improved both her fine motor skills (pointing to the words in order) and her listening skills. Now we just need the princesses to do a math book too!!!
"I have a dog who eats poop. He eats his sometimes but he most definitely eats the other dog's poop, as soon as she goes!So I have to pick up poop every time 2 medium sized dogs go out in our backyard. And I don't do poop-scooping well (hand problems). I've used these for years when I cycled with my dogs. They are sturdy. You hands don't get gross even if you're picking up loose stool, which I have been recently as one of my dog's is sick. I think they are a good bargain if you buy them in a packages of eight.I don't know how well they'd work if you had, say, a Great Dane, but they seem to have a good capacity.Biggest downside is they are hard to open, like a sticky plastic bag would be....you have to struggle a bit but it's understandable because they are on a roll! I try to get the bag going before I really need it! Plus they're not biodegradable but I've also heard you shouldn't use dog stool as fertilizer anyway."
"This stuff works, but Alpha Hydrox's Enhanced AHA Creme works just as well (despite being a slightly lower percentage of AHA), contains more (2 oz vs 1.6 oz) and costs several dollars less. I've used them both and find the lower percentage a better bargain."
"First off this is NOT a toy, its a chew treat but what a great item.They are really hard and doggie loved it. He kept it as his new best buddy for 2 days. Saving the other 2 till he does something great. Fair price for that much enjoyment."
"I tried this trainer on my German Shepherd. It eats the expensive batteries like my dog eats kibble- I had to buy new ones weekly. I was even being certain to turn it off at night for bedtime and during the work day.With brand new batteries in, i would do a training session, and halfway through, the dog stopped responding. I checked the collar after increasing the level and it had turned off. This happened every time I tried to use the collar. called the manufacturer, and no luck, no refunds, no exchange, lousy service.I also work with a group of aggressive dogs working on training. at the trainer's behest, several participants are using electronic collars. the 2 participants using this one are not happy. either the stimulation is insufficient for their dog, or the battery issue gets to them.The collar worked well as a training tool when it was on, but the unpredictability of it turning of defeats the whole purpose-anyone who works with dogs knows inconsistency is the failure of training."
"These are wonderful! For my complete review, please see the ""Pink Soft Claws"" page. I will repeat a bit here - the cat for whom I purchased this specific color is 12 years old and nearly completely deaf from ear tumors. He is my baby though! He had developed the habit of clawing me to get my attention, I guess because he couldn't hear me, so maybe he thought I couldn't hear him. I was not enjoying the sensation of being clawed to death on my left thigh as I sat at my desk! So I found this product and put them on him yesterday. What a relief! No more scratches on my, and now he can get my attention any time he needs to.He was completely unfazed when we installed these covers. My husband held the cat while I clipped off the tips of his claws and then glued the covers in place. He is an extremely fluffy long-haired cat, but we only managed to glue his fur to the claw cover once! If you are careful and thorough when smoothing the fur away from the claw, you won't catch it.I highly recommend these covers! They are a great alternative to getting clawed to pieces! ;-)"
I ordered this product and it is not at all the scent I ordered!!! This D&G Light Blue I received smells nothing like the D&G Light Blue I normally purchase from Macy's. I wish I could get my money back!! It was horrible!!!
"I was so excited to get this product, but after a couple weeks use, I started having the same problems as other reviewers. The clumps would stick to the rake and the bottom of the pan, and would jam it so the rake would get too heavy and couldn't lift it up high enough to dump it. I have two cats, and both of my cats have a tendency to use the same corner everytime, so that the waste receptacle was always full on one side and empty on the other, unless I constantly got in and redistributed. I would have to redistribute the clumps for the rake to work as well. Otherwise it was too heavy on one side and would get stuck. Then it tries a few more times to scoop the clumps up, but it is so noisy that it wakes you up with all its struggles in the middle of the night.I have had for about 5 months now, and this morning at 4am, it broke. The whole arm with the rake and the motor broke clean off, and I can see no way to repair it. However, after it broke, the motor continued to run and run until I got up and turned it off. I am quite disappointed, and do not plan to buy a second one and try again. I am surprised after reading all of the bad reviews that LitterMaid has not improved their product. I am also surprised they are even still in business. As soon as I can save some money, I am purchasing the Litter Robot."
"We were excited to assemble this playset only to quickly realize that it's a very poorly constructed toy. From the get-go, removable pieces couldn't even stay in place and pieces were either falling off or tipping over. Definitely a frustrating thing for a young child. For the price that was paid, it should have been more durable. The only impressive thing about it is the detail they put into how the castle looks. Unfortunatly, I consider only one (out of two) main pieces of the castle to be functional (and somewhat entertaining) with its trap doors and levers. The second part is useless and is already stuffed in a bag with all its pieces fallen off--and we just bought it an hour ago! I'd invest in the action figures, which are better constructed, not these playsets. Truly a disappointment."
This company has apparently changed the type of plastic replacement flaps. Please make sure you know which style of flap to purchase. We spent over fifty dollars on the wrong flap and found the correct one on Amazon at a much lesser price. Shipping was free and quick. J.M.Cranford
"In 2007 my mom bought my sister and I this straightener for Christmas. She bought two so we wouldn't fight over it like most sisters do. We both have used ours pretty much everyday. Between going to school and work, our hair always had to be straight! My sister's stopped working in December of 2010 and mine just stopped working this week! Every other straightener I have bought since I was 14 (now 23) only lasted a maximum of one year. I think this is the best straightener out there! My sister bought the same exact one again back in December, and I am about to buy it as well. They are definitely a lot cheaper now, and well worth the money! Whether you have short or long hair, it will work for you!"
"I received this as a gift and did not care for it. I love the smell of citrus and oranges, however I do not personally want to smell like one. This stuff makes me noxious to be honest. Different strokes for different folks I guess."
This is a great stuffed animal at a great price. It is pretty realistic and made well. I will be buying all of these for my daughters bedroom.
"After receiving the chess timer, replaced batteries only to find out the timer is defective. I really needed a timer for my daughter's chess tournament. Since this one did not work, she ended up using her play mates timer. Returned the item. Would not recommend."
This is a small bottle but exactly what I was looking for to travel with. I didn't want to risk taking the larger bottle.
This is a fun game to play with family and friends. The game can be pretty fast moving once you get the hang of the voting. The directions must have been translated (poorly) into English.
"This product works well at low speeds but when you use it on high speed and try to grind a dog's nails, it slows down considerably. Motor needs more torque! I returned this product and purchased a Dremel variable speed 35000RPM model that works great! Amazon is GREAT about processing returns and ensuring the customer is satisfied!"
I was very pleased with the speed of delivery and the product was exactly as described. I am very pleased and would recommended this site to others.
"I had a smaller travel Conair for years and it just died. I needed to make sure the next one was up to speed. This little dryer is perfect. I have long hair and I don't like to spend a ton of time drying my hair, so I need something powerful. I use this dryer as my everyday hair dryer, it's small size makes it easy to store and also not heavy to hold so your arm doesn't get sore.Also comes with a switch so that you can adjust the voltage if you travel abroad. Very handy.Highly recommend this hair dryer!"
"I purchased this set expecting something very nice, hence the hefty $16 price tag. I was very disappointed. The pieces don't stand even, and easily tip over. The kings and queens are top-heavy so they constantly fall over and the board doesn't sit even because the latch is larger than the board. Pass on this, invest in a nice one."
"Muggles this is the closest thing you will ever get to hair magic! I was skeptical but it was on sale for about $9, so I ordered it WOW! I'm speechless my 11 year old daughter has very curly hair and she didn't scream one time while using the tangle tamer really is magic! Great product!"
"I have been using this product for so many years. It is an excellent product!! It keeps your hair curl. On the other hand, it will not harm or hurt your hair texture. Thus, no sticky feeling at all even though you don't wash your hair on the second day after you used this product...=PFor processing order wise, it takes a little bit longer than I expect, but product came in as if and also in excellent condition. The price and shipping are reasonable, too."
would you like to hear your kids laugh? this game is so much fun. my son laughs and screams all the time playing. although he is just three we changed the rules a little bit for him and we can play for hours. if you want to have a lot of fun with your kid I would definitely recommend this game.
"Great product, works just as described! After about a month I was able to set it to sound only and now I don't need to buy any of the air canisters. I have tried other brands and other products but this is the best. I am getting two more. Love it!"
Great fragrance and I have used it for years. Half off what you'd pay at a Tommy Bahama store.I don't know why anyone would waste an extra 30 bucks when you can get it online at this price.
"I think its Great, My Child loves it!!! Teaches him to count and know his numbers , has a few other things on it , I just think its Great all around"
i think this is good because it gives more power to your beyblade and more accuracy
"I bought the mobile for my daughter before she was born, and she is still using it at 2 years of age! When she was 5 months, I took the Eeyore off the mobile and she has carried him around ever since. The neat thing about that is, whenever she wears her &quot;lovie&quot; out, I can just request to buy a replacement Eeyore, and she's good to go! I love it."
"this is exeactly the type of dryer you see in most hotels, and is perfect for our guesthouse ... no more replacing hairdyers that were packed away by mistake by our guests. It was shipped very fast as well."
"I bought this for my 4-year-old granddaughter and she LOVES it. Her imagination runs wild and she creates all kinds of stories with the characters. They are well made and durable. When she and the neighbor children come over to play, they play with this set for hours, each child assuming a different character and story."
"I asked my son's grandmother to buy this product for my 2 year old. We have a less tahn 2 year old DVD player and this product does not work with it. It does work with our portable DVD player. Here is the thing....When you call Fisher Price, the recording says something like ""We are experiencing heavy volume calling. Please call back at another time"". This has been since Christmas Day and today is January 5th. At tis point we may just have to go out and buy a cheap DVD player just to use this product. I am very disappointed in FP for not at least answering the line. I will never ever buy another FP Product. They launched a product that requires more tech support than installing batteries and they can't handle it. This is poor customer relations. Thank goodness for Leap Frog and other companies that offer better learning toys anyway.Just make sure you know this product works with your DVD player before buying it!!I give FP a big Zero and a middle finger!! As far as my rating is concered, You have to check at least 1 star to get this submitted."
"I had a puerto rican boyfriend who wore this cologne and it absolutely DROVE ME WILD!! This smells so incredibly SEXY I cannot even describe to you what it does to me!I am no longer with him, but I notice a lot of the hot latino men around town wear this fragrance, and I kid you not.... when I am in store and I smell this cologne on a man... I SERIOUSLY follow him all around the store inhaling deeply and if I catch his eye, I will often say, ""Geez, you smell so good I think I'm going to follow you home.""It usually gets a smile. I absolutely ADORE this cologne and it affects me like no other fragrance EVER has in my life. It's worth every penny. But don't overuse it men.... there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Sizzzzzling hot.... Farenheit is a GREAT name for this. YEOW!"
"This is an amazing product. I do not own a pet, but have a 9yr old who recently developed a bed wetting habit and who often falls asleep on the sofa...which of course does not have removable cushions or covers that can be washed. I had tried everything..including small shampooers..but nothing was really able to get that tell-tell odor of urine out of the cushions, and even used bleach based cleaners on the mattress, which also left a faint urine smell behind. However, this took care of everything...almost immediately! It has a very pleasant, light aroma, and a little goes a long way. I have treated both the sofa and her bed completely, and have used only about 1/5 of the bottle. Within a few hours the urine smell was gone..and now I can have company over again without the worry :)"
Agree with previous reviews that this is the best pads around. Do wish that the price is not so high as it is a factor in my purchasing another brand that is not as good.
"Who the hell would let a 3 y.o. play with this toy, with so many small and life-like plastic peas? Particularly, the round and smooth shape make the peas easy to be stuck into the kid's nose and/or swallowed. There is a lawsuit waiting to happen."
I like the Le Bistro Waterer for my dogs. It is easy to use and maintain. PetSmart made a big mistake pulling this item from their shelves. The bowls are easy to take apart and clean and the water bottle is easy to fill (as much as 5 gallons is heavy to pick up).
"I specifically ordered Durvet brand permethrin 10%, 32 oz. This is the brand I have always used for my horses. I paid more because the product was fulfilled by amazon.com, a website I trust. It was delivered quickly but I did not open it immediately. I opened it yesterday and the brand I ordered is not the brand I received.I was sent a different brand, which may or may not work as well. I am very disappointed with this state of affairs but I have no alternative."
"We bought my son this for his first Christmas (he was around 9 months) although he didnt really get into playing on this until he was 1 1/2, he is getting some good use out of it. I love how the horse is washable! Makes for very easy cleaning. This is a great starter rocking horse!"
"We are very happy with the product. Purchased on Amazon, fast shipping, good price. We installed ourselves. Trick was to dig with a flat spade or shovel at an ~45 angle and lift up the grass at about 1 - 3 inches and run the wire placing flags as you go. Watch out that the copper wire provided has no extra length to the specifications listed on the box (trust me don't cut an extra inch). Training the dog was easy with only an occasional ZAP because of birds on the other side. Great product!"
"Sure wish I knew before I ordered this perfume that there was no returns! It smelled terrible! Must have been on the shelves way too long. Talk about throwing money away! Thats exactly what I did, threw it in the garbage!"
My 3 year old son plays with this take a long thomas set in the car...everywhere we go ..he has to take it along with him. This toy is a total lifesaver for long trips and even the short trips....keeps him entertained for hours!!
My dog loves Nylabones! We go through one a month. I love the three pack because its much cheaper than buying single packs at the petstore.
This Body Shop body cream smells great! The smell lingers all day long from your body and it is not too rich or oily. It reminds you of a nice summery day!
"I used to walk and train large dogs and standardly used the Gentle Leader. The Gentle Leader is a must-have for owners who want to humanely train their dog to walk on a leash and follow commands without being pulled by the dog. The Gentle Leader goes over the dog's snout and clasps at the back of the neck. Your regular leash attaches to a ring that hangs below the chin (it is part of the Gentle Leader). Any time the dog pulls on the leash, his/her head will turn instead, which prevents him/her from pulling you. The dog doesn't get choked like pinch collars and collars with spikes do.All puppy and dog owners should use the Gentle Leader to train their pets to walk on a leash and follow commands. It gives you more control over the dog, which is safer for both of you, and makes training your dog to walk on a leash easier."
"My two Shih Tzu are picky eaters. But they seem to like the Wellness foods better than any other I've tried. However, this particular variety doesn't seem to be quite as big of a hit with them as the other Wellness canned varieties we've tried. But they do eat it. As for it helping with food allergies.. and for sensitive stomachs.. I'm not so sure yet. I've been feeding it to them for several weeks now, but don't see any diference so far."
"My 7 yr. old got the FLY for Christmas. All I can say is it is absolutely wonderful!!!! The only reason I give it 4, instead of 5 stars, is because of the lack of software available for it right now. But, I am sure that more is to come. The pen is very easy to use. It tells you exactly what to write, or touch, in order to use all the options. Also, it is very educational. There are lots of games to play and things to do that spark the imagination. My daughter thinks it is great, as well. Even my teenage nephews has a great time with it and would like one of their own!!!! You do have to use the special paper, BUT, once you write or draw something, you can reuse it over and over. For example, if you draw the keyboard and all of the icons, you can use that same piece of paper over and over, instead of re-drawing it each time. It is a little on the expensive side, but compared to a video gaming system, it is actually cheap!! And, you get all the educational value!!!!! Definitely worth buying!"
"I got this for my cat who's about 11 - 12 lbs.It works like the description says. But, my cat doesn't seem to like it though.The reason that I put a 3 star for this is because it actually makes a big mess when you use the rake. And if you use the slicker brush, its hard to get all the fur out. It works, but its kind of a pain in the butt. I have carpet in EVERY room except the kitchen and bath; and sadly, my kitchen & bath isn't a suitable environment to use this in. Nowhere to sit so I can hold on to my cat (cause he'll runaway if I don't have him sit on my lap while using this).Also, I'm not sure if this is intended for cat use or dog use; but, this is too big for my cat. I think this is more suitable for a dog instead; unless you have a HUGE cat :PI use this on my bed in my room, and its just a big pain in the butt to clean up afterwards. But I guess that's expected...But, it works like it says...That's what's important right?"
"i got this as a present for my pre-2 year old after the birth of his little sister.we went to Toysrus and he and i picked out a present for his sister and for himself. i have loved introducing him to the Star Wars history that i grew up with. he LOVES his ""guys"" and plays with them all the time.this product is a great way to get a lot of ""guys"" for your buck. it comes with 10. that gives him almost 30 now.that's probably too many.oh well."
"I read the other reviews and believed them. My mistake. After forty minutes of rollerblading the stuff was in my eyes. As it was after forty minutes of kettlebell exercises on my roof.I have had melanoma. I am a personal trainer. So called previous waterproof, sweatproof products did exactly the same thing. It is NOT advised that one rollerblade with eyes closed, yet that happens briefly. The stuff burns the eyes.So this review is really relevant for people who are active and athletic. These so-called sweatproof products work for about forty minutes and then fail. So I've devised some other solutions. Currently I am covering my forehead with fabric treated with sunprotection and applying the product beneath the eyes. [I always wear large lensed photochromatic goggleish glasses which protect the eyes from sun damage.] Another way to go would be, I think, skydiving or ski goggles that actually seal the eye area from moisture[I think - I haven't tried them yet], or, perhaps, swimming goggles. I have the latter, but they aren't that comfortable."
"Another great product from Davidoff.I've always been a fan of Cool Water and now I have another product from Davidoff that I love. It has a great fresh scent much like Cool Water, yet unique in it's own way. The bottle is also a bit different but a good design.I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who likes Cool Water.Delivery time from Amazon was great."
"This is a fantastic toy and a favorite in our house, both with our pup and with the humans.I ordered the small as an alternative to a tennis ball (which my puppy likes to rip the covering off of and eat--bad for his tummy!). I am so glad I did, cause it is a FANTATIC ball.Pup loves it cause he can chew it easily, it collapses in his jaws but immediately springs back to shape. Outside we play fetch with it and I can bounce it just like a tennis ball to get him excited about it. Plus it has a fun and unpredictable bounce--to keep him guessing. Since it is rubber-like, there is no lingering slobber and a quick rinse makes in indoor ready in seconds! Quite unlike those tennis balls that are banished forever to the back yard.Inside, I fill it with large sized kibble and some broken up jerky treats, and let him have at it without fear of hurting my hardwood floors cause it is super soft (unlike many treat balls). He can even use it as a chew toy when he settles on his bed in the living room, after weeks it still looks brand new--SUPER durable.Downside"
"My original expectation of this product was to provide a world of learning and musical fun for my three year-old daughter, Felicity. At first, the LeapFrog Learn and Groove Musical Table seemed to deliver on these expectations. However, things went terribly wrong when my child was overzealous in her enjoyment of the macarana setting. While spinning during the song is encouraged as part of the LeapFrog experience, she continued spinning long after the song had ended.Still spinning, Felicity inadvertently bumped into another button on the table, activating the trombone slide. The sudden, jarring change in volume level caused her to jump into the air--landing on the adjustable, plastic-molded legs. Felicity and the LeapFrog Learn and Groove table collapsed to the floor.Thankfully, she escaped major injury. After a couple of hours in the emergency room, my wife and I were relieved Felicity had only suffered a couple of cuts and bruises, in addition to a broken arm. Because of this, I am unable to recommend this product to other parents."
"I must admit that I am a game adict and it is difficult to find games that everyone will agree to play. There are many drawing games that many will refuse to play because they think they ""can't draw"". A game that is super fun to play is ""Who, What, Where"", but since it is 5 minutes of actual drawing a picture, most people refuse to play. This is not a problem with this game, since it is doodling and fast paced, people will agree to doodle out their best interpretation of an object.In Oodles of Doodles, you select a card that has a subject matter on it. Now, there can be up to eight objects on the back of the card (sometimes less) and each drawing item fits into the clue on the front of the card. So, we are already starting off with an understanding of where the drawer is going. Then there is a whiteboard with 8 boxes for drawing 1 item in each box. For example, the card might say"
I am a first time mother of a seven month old baby girl. Breast feeding was so wonderful thanks to this product. It protects by creating a barrier on the breast to reduce the wear and tear that is so common. I loved it and recommend it to all new breast feeding moms.
"A must have for all dog-lovers! Fresh n' Clean is an instant, effective and inexpensive tool for eliminating pet odor. I worked for a dog groomer for several years and have owned many pets. I have yet to see a product work better! I am not a fan of most pet scents or colognes, but I have a fond appreciation for Fresh n Clean products. My favorite scents are Baby Powder and Fresh Floral scent. In my opinion, this product is more like a deodorizer or deodorant than a cologne spray, because it seems to do a lot more than just ""cover-up"" odor. Jade (our Akita) always receives lots of compliments at the Dog Park from other Pet Owner's when she is wearing it. Everyone always thinks she has just had a bath. To me, that is the ultimate compliment!"
"Terrific toy. Fosters pretend play. Very educational, but extremely fun, too. Great aid in teaching animals and animal sounds. Excellent wooden construction. Very sturdy. Big enough for small children, also. Both my 9 month old and my 2 year old love these toys."
We still cannot control one of our dog's pulling on walks. This harness has made no difference at all.
"I liked this so much I bought 3. At first I was disappointed in the quality. The preproduction images where much better than the toy as usual. But once I opened it up I was very pleased with it. It's too bad they are so close to having a 5 star toy here, there are minor details that hold it back. Much better than the older version. Very cool.Update"
Very cute and very fun desk accessory! We are big Star Wars fans and this is a perfect addition to the collection. You cannot be in a bad mood while looking at Tater Vader (as we fondly call him). :)
"We purchased these as gifts for school employees because the school mascot is a ""Wild Cat"" and the school colors are green and white. This is perfect for the girls in the office to hang and show school spirit AND holiday spirit.They are very thick and plush. Very high quality. I'm surprised we got them at this price! These are truly worth every penny."
"this is a great cart... very well made. strong durable construction... very large. holds my 92 lb ""Bear"" and my 120 lb girlfriend... mounts to bike very easily and pulls very smoothly... nice to have the extra pockets to put leash and dogbowl... in an effort to ""go green"" we ride our bikes to the grocery store and use this cart to haul the groceries back with us. works amazing for this too... one thing everyone should take into play when purchasing any cart would be your dog. consider if your dog will actually go into this thing. this particular cart is very sturdy but a dog that won't enter a kennell cage won't ever consider a cart ride.overall very nice product. would buy again."
"My hair was pretty light, and I put this on wanting the wonderful color on the box and swatch. NO!! It came out an ugly flat darkish brown, not even an appealing brown color, and I followed the directions 100% as directed by the pamphlet that came with the color. There was zero, and I mean ZERO hint of any color in this other than brown."
"I love this product, just wish I could still get it at Walmart. The size was 3 oz vs 1 oz through Amazon and I only paid $4 per jar. Glad it is still available."
"I bought these after reading an article in Consumer Reports. I cannot say enough for how they cleanse and how gentle and thorough they are. I think back to my decades-ago teen years and wish I had had them then! For seniors with Alzheimer's who like to pick at their skin they are also perfect, giving them nothing to pick at! I highly recommend this above any and all soaps and all other cleansers I have ever tried."
"The littermaid has saved me from cleaning the cat box every day (I have three cats). My cats hated the ramp, peed on the rug and never ever used it (they enter from the side) so I tossed it, but it's just fine without ramp. While it is rather noisy when it rakes, the littermaid is a delight to have for a scooping service. It actually works quite well but you're still going to have to clean between the rakes to get the stuck poops out every now and then. Oh, and cleaning it is a nightmare, but still a million times better than dealing with a manual box. My cats love their littermaid especially because their litter is always nice and clean for the most part. Try to reuse the receptacles because they are a rip-off (hot sudsy water will do )and read the manual so you don't break the machine, and you will be glad you got it. Don't expect a miracle. There simply is no miracle answer to cat toilets. Just love the fewer days spent dealing with the litter mess!"
"This is a very light scent. Good for a young girl or someone who likes just a bit of scent. Pretty, but not for me. Came to me very well wrapped."
"I wear Sisterlocs and my hair is dense and full. It would take hours under the drier and still would not be dry. This dryer makes my life so much easier. It dries my hair, doesn't take all day and is light weight and mobile. So far so good."
"If so, then this game is right up your alley. I bought it for our 6 year old daughter after reading the rave reviews. Ummmm .... unless we were doing something seriously wrong, I dont get what all the excitement was about. Its dull, it takes FOREVER to get through, and it was a definite Christmas miss at our house. The overall concept sounded great, but the execution was lacking. That being said, the game components are of a beautiful quality, and Im sure that even with a lot of play, that this game would last quite a while. Not our cup of tea, but if you enjoy spending upwards of an hour with a child's ""no reading required"" board game, and getting absolutely nowhere, then this is the game for you. Cannot recommend."
"This advent calendar is pretty lackluster, many of the days are boring. Last year we had winter in the park and it was much more suited towards christmas. We didn't realize that the knights wouldn't have anything to do with xmas at all and just provided a bunch of crappy swords and nothing that was really exciting for toddlers. Maybe this would be better for much older kids, but other advent calendars we've gotten have been fun for all ages."
I use this product on my Spaniel monthly and she still got Lyme.... Go figure.
"I got two of these cars for my twin boys for Xmas and they are fantastic..fun, adorable , fast , durable..five star purchase"
Absolutely LOVE this flat iron -- my hairdresser uses it and I just had to have my own too -- and it is amazing!!! Makes my hair soooo straight and shiny!!!
I fell in love with this scent years ago while in the Caribbean. It's light and refreshing.I checked many other online prices and Amazon's price was the best. It arrived quickly andwell packaged.
"I did a Google search for Royall Bay Rhum 8 0z All Purpose Lotion. Came up with Amazon hit ""ROYALL BAYRHUM OF BERMUDA Cologne by Royall Fragrances for Men - @ Up To 55% Off"" with image of the product I wanted to order, namely a package of Royall Bay Rhum 8 0z All Purpose Lotion. I placed the order and received a 2 oz bottle of the product. Not fair."
"All braided headbands are not created equal!Good points - soft, comfortableNegative - This headband did not keep its shape when washed! I washed in a laundry bag on perm. press cycle. It also is huge, and I have a big (7&3/4) head."
"I thought that I would give this fragrance a try. I don't have much luck with fragrances, must be my body chemistry. But again, this did not smell good on me at all, but fortunately the fragrance does not last long so I did not offend anyone else."
This blade is worse than the one I was trying to replace. It seems to be extremely dull. It is suppose to be a new blade but I question that claim.
"I just purchased this Leap Pad for my 4 year old son. We have 2 other leap pad systems, the My first leap pad and the original leap pad system. When I previously bought those systems for my son he was'nt ready to learn to write. Now however, he is old enough for this system and after a lot of attempts to get him to practice letters and practice writing his name I could'nt get him to really pay attention to me to write his letters, he would get bored and be ready to quit trying. I then decided on getting the Leap Pad System Plus Writing.When I went to purchase it, I saw the Leap Pad Plus Writing Plus Microphone System that also included 2 books. I could'nt find a price, so I picked it up and put it in the cart to see how much it cost, to my great surprise it was the same amount of money as the Leap Plus Writing. (I don't think any other store carries the Leap Pad Writing and Microphone system except Toys R Us) So I was even more pleased that it had an additional feature of the microphone.When I got home and opened it up for my son to start writing and playing with it, I was really surprised at how easy it was for him to hold the pencil stylus and he quickly traced the letters on the pages almost flawlessly! He loved it, he loved how the letters made sounds, for instance the letter I will say I-I-I-ICKY as you trace over it. He laughs each time a letter talks as he is tracing over them. Then we began playing with the microphone feature I never dreamed how much enjoyment he'd get out of this feature! It is a huge plus to have the microphone! One of the starter books that came with it has several pages that you can use the microphone on it, there is one page that you make a car sound and it uses your voice to sound like its starting the car on the page. Its really funny to get the sounds on the page with my son's voice. He laughs and giggles and it keeps him occupied for at least an hour at a time! Learning letters and learning to write has never been more fun until we bought this system. It is a WONDERFUL system and I can't say enough good things about it. If you are thinking of getting a leap pad for your child, go with the writing and microphone. If you think your child is not old enough yet for the writing feature, just take out the lead in the pencil. Another really great thing about the leap pad writing system, if you purchase any of the leap pad writing books they come with a new pencil with lead.Another thing about this system, its more compact than the original leap pad, its very sturdy and it also comes with an eraser storage pocket and an eraser for the writing books. I figured the pencil would have an eraser on the end of it, but they don't instead they made a big eraser, easier for smaller kids to erase off their pages to re use them or to correct thier mistakes and a handy storage pocket to keep your eraser handy at all times.Another thing I noticed about the system is the pencil stylus stays put once its snapped in the system, the other leap pads we have the stylus is hard to get to stay. They made this leap pad very durable and I agree with another reviewer- this is the ""cadallic of all leap pads!""This system is worth every penny I paid for it. My 4 year old is already mastering writing words and has learned to spell several new words because of this system. I am so pleased with this leap pad, I would highly reccommend it!!!"
"I have occasional breakouts and I usually turn to my normal skincare regimen (Nutragena acne solutions or something), but I bought this a couple years back and then put it under my sink and forgot about it. I used it a couple weeks ago after cleaning out my bathroom and I have to say it works better than nutragena! Ok, well I still use a salicylic acid scrub before I use this, but I have definitely seen an improvement in the clarity of my skin after using it. It smells really good too, like pumpkin pie!"
My daughter loves this toy. She has used the head as a teether and is entertained by the clacking it makes when she shakes it. I am happy that is made of wood and non-toxic paint. Another great toy by haba!
"These figures are for two of the cantina aliens in A New Hope. In the book of short stories, Tales From the Mos Eisley Cantina they were put together. Muftak is a Talz, one of only two Talz action figures ever made. He has great detail and comes with a cool blaster. He has a swivel neck, shoulders and hips. He also has a swivel elbow on his right arm so you can make him scratch his head, just like in the movie. In the short story this is revealed to be a frequent habit of his. Kabe is an 11 year old girl. She has swivel neck, shoulders and waist. And comes with a cool looking little vibro axe. In the story she is a pick pocket and addicted to a drink called Juri juice, also now as Jawa juice. They repainted her for the 2006 saga collection, but this one's paint job is much more film accurate. Plus this 2 pack is the only way to get the Muftak figure."
"They didn't last three days, walking less than an hour each time. The bottom ""Sturdy, protective polyvinyl nonskid soles"" are plastic and breakdown when the temps are freezing or below. Without walking on any pavement/concrete, our Lab tore through the first boot on day one, another on day two, and shredded a third boot within five minutes of playing fetch on snow."
"Last year, I've bought and use them from Costco last year but this year Costco carries the Banana Boat product. Great sunscreen for sports comparing to Banana Boat's. I've bought 6 (8/1/07) from Amazon in the first order then I've bought another 6 (8/20/07) from Amazon since it has %25 discount."
"I used to use another product, it has good effect on control the size.I only had on elbow. I bought this product because it has good review.I used it three times a day, the skin surface become flat.However, just the time I think it's good enough, it become worse. The infected area are twice bigger now.I guess you have to keep using this product, which makes me feel not safe."
"Remember those pulsating pixels on a DOS game screen of your old PC. Yes, you can see them back and enjoy the same quality, unadulterated fun with this TV game toy. It does not need power input (batter operated) and so i bought it immediately to gift it to my nephew in India. But, Alas little did i realize that it is NOT compatible with PAL TV systems of India. So, my nephew could only see lines & noise on the Indian TV screen when it was hooked up. Thankfully, we had a multi-system player and could hook it up through that to TV. I personally think that more games could have been included, but still it is a good buy as such.I saw similar systems from Singapore market with more games available at the same price.Since my nephew is only 4 years old, it didn't last long (not very durable) in his hands. I wouldn't blame Toymax for it. They wouldn't be able to manufacture anything which withstands powerful throw at a cement wall and repeated thrashings against the floor.I had to buy a second one for myself when i returned home..."
"We received this as a gift for my daughter at Christmas when she was 4 months old. She really enjoys playing with this toy, especially now that she is older and can stand with help. The legs are removable for younger kids, but to avoid misplacing them we attached them right away. My only complaint is that this isn't a toy she can easily play with on her own. Even with the legs off for younger ages, she would only be able to interact with just one section of the table. But, overall, this has been a fun toy that is extremely educational (words, languages, colors, music, alphabet, numbers) and interactive (buttons, lights, page to turn, door to open)."
"Cute toy, liked it because it looks just like my little 15 lb. King Charles Spaniel. She LOVED it but had the nose ripped off and the stuffing pulled out within an hour of giving it to her. Hope I can sew it up again but if not will have to throw it away which will be a big waste of money."
I have pretty thin hair and this shampoo gives it some texture which helps make it less ratty- it is important to follow the directions though... lathering for 60 seconds opposed to say 15 seconds does make a difference.
Liked this gel at Sports Clips and got it quickly and well packaged through Amazon from Super Wholesale. Would order again when we run out.
This is possibly one of my German Shepherd/Border Collie pups FAVORITE toys ever...that being said she did manage to do it in. She is an aggressive chewer and managed to chew off the rubber around the top of the jug- which made it unsafe for her to keep playing with. It did keep her busy for hours trying to get her food or treats out of it.If you do have an aggressive chewer check out the squirrel dude...same concept of a treat to eat toy- not as much room inside and easier to do so it doesn't last as long at least for my dog- but it has stayed in one piece!Premier Squirrel Dude Large
"do not hesitate to purchase this game, as it is worth the price!my six year old grandson kept bringing it to the table to play with and he was clearlyhaving fun. the skills used to reproduce the card patterns with and without colors areso varied; visual, dexterity, co-ordination of sequential thinking and awareness ofsurroundings all come into play as the player builds a 3-d construction from a carddrawn from the pile... a timer adds the extra dimension of a race with three levels ofspeed to challenge the turn. played against/with another and there is great interactiveenergy. the pieces of wood are bright and smooth, the cards are sturdy, the timer alone couldbe irritating as a noise maker, but in the context of the game, it is tolerable. one die is used to determinethe 1-2-3 level of time for each round.... this game is simple enough for the pre-schooler for learning colorsand eye/hand control and challenging enough for adults to thoroughly enjoy."
"Bought the alligator for my 1 year old Grandson. He loves pulling this around and listening to the ""click-clack"" noise. Only complaint is that one of the rubber type bands came off of the wheel. My daughter is going to call the company to see if they will replace. I would buy again."
BUY FROM A MANUFACTURER THAT STANDS BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT NOT THIS COMPANY. We bought a small unit through Amazon mid march 2011. The warranty is good for one year. Literally 1 year AND 2 WEEKS LATER (so 2 weeks out of warranty) the unit dumped all the food during the night into the bowl. The motor tries to turn but the food won't dispense anymore. We called the manufacturer 1-888-ERGOSYS and spoke with SAMUEL email sam@ergosys.net who had us look at the timer (not the problem) and test the motor from which he determined that a power fluctuation caused the motor to strip the gears. WRONG! It's on a power protector because our pet's health is important to us! Even after speaking with his 'supervisor' the best they could offer is to sell us a replacement base for 20% off the $70+shipping+handling charge which is nearly the cost of a new unit. They don't sell the parts or do the refurbishment. ANY COMPANY THAT WOULD NOT HONOR A UNIT 2 WEEKS OUT OF WARRANTY IS SIMPLY NOT STANDING BEHIND THEIR PRODUCT. For $120 you can buy a lot of other feeders so do yourself a favor and buy a different brand.
This olay eye serum is the best I have ever used. It provides just enough moisture so my eyes look awake and young and wrinkle free! It's truly the best I've ever used.
"This appealed to me since I would be able to use it longer than the standard mobile, but it ended up not working when we wanted it to anyways. I liked to idea, but just doesn't work. This mobile constantly stops working (before the 8 minutes are up)...it stops going round. The music continues & the lights are still on, but the base stops rotating, it seems as though it always gets ""stuck"" and we have to push it to get ""unstuck"". We've changed the battery and that doesn't seem to help as the base keeps getting stuck, I contacted Mattel to get a voucher since it's been more than 90 days since I bought this, can't return it in the store. (It's kind of big and ugly too, didn't expect that from the picture.)"
"I soak them in water, then cut them up for my little Yorkies. I have left one big one around and they drag it around, it is pretty funny. I recommend them for any size dog."
"I disagree with the previous reviewer regarding this toys educational value. It teaches counting skills and is very good for the beginner reader. Also, the spinner helps with number recognition for the little ones.My kids have fun playing this game. It goes by quickly and is easy for them to play without help. They are age 6 and 4. My two year old loves to stack the beds together."
I got this for my seven-month old and he immediately loved it. It took him no time to learn how to press the blue handle down and get one of the peek-a-rounds gumballs to come out. The top only has room for four or five of the peek-a-rounds (it comes with four
"My husband and I have been playing the Radica Solitaire games for over 10 years. We finally bought the new one - we have been playing for over 10 hours and have not been able to run a game. Who ever did the software for this game was sick - the most cards you will ever get is 4 in the suites.This is definitely NOT worth the money and we are asking for a refund.Unfortunately, the older ones that we had, we thru away.I contacted Radica and they said the older ones were to easy - I agree, but why go so much the other way that it is not even fun to play anymoreDO NOT BUY THIS GAME - NOT WORTH IT"
"I wear the men's version, while my wife wears the women's. Very classy scent. We love them both."
"I began reading to my daughter as soon as we arrived home from the hospital. As a kindergarten and first grade teacher, I understand how important it is to read to children. I decided to buy her this for C-mas even though she was only 4.5 months old. We began using together right away. She enjoys the stories the most when I read the words to her instead of having the computer do it. She is now six months old and we use this about three days a week as part of our daily reading routine. It's interesting to me to see how she tries to get the noises to work on the pages (she is not strong enough yet) as she doesn't bang on the pages of her other books.I think the most important thing to remember when using this toy is that it is meant to be used as a tool to help parents read to their children, not as a subsitute for reading together. If you sit down with your child and read with this toy, I'm sure that s/he will be more interested then if you expect him/her to play alone."
"These are great for keeping my beagle busy. We used to get a different brand that smelled so strong we called them ""stinky sticks."" The fact that these are free range makes me feel much better, and they don't stink."
"Drinkwell replacement filters, fit well and seem to work. Have to be honest that I haven't drunk any of my cat's water so can't comment on the flavor but he seems to like it :)"
"Bought this toy and a family member made a terrible mistake and threw the box containing this out, and this is the only thing my son wanted this year-any ideas on how to get another one? thanks everyone!"
THis is the best cream/lotion product that I have ever found. The cream is not heavy or greasy and it is very moisturizing. I use it right out of the shower and ignore the night renewal part. It is a great everyday moisturizer that I can't live without. It is very hard to find in stores but I can find it online. Maybe it would be more popular if it wasn't labeled a night renewal cream. I love the light fresh scent also. My sister and mother love to use it also. I'll be lost if Nivea ever drops this cream from their product line. Thanks Nivea!
"What a piece of junk. This toy is impossible to put together and the pieces fall off if your child touches it. The elevator does not move easily at all, causing great frustration for a 3 year old. The baskets that hold the pony are supposed to snap in, they do not. This toy was very frustrating for my daughter. I plan to return it tomorrow."
Love the pattern on this leash. So cute. Just wish is was on both sides. It's made well and I love the lifetime warranty that Lupine offeres even if chewed. Has worked out wonderfully so far for our Lab puppy.
"My 12 lb poodle mix destroyed this ball in less than an hour. The concept is what I have been hoping for.However, no company seems to be willing to make it out of better material. It just needs to be madewith a better plastic/rubber material. It does keep your dog very busy, but then it gets ripped apart tooquickly."
This product really helped my son stop sucking his thumb. We only had to apply it three times and he was done!
"Have a half greyhound half German shep, huge nose :) fits great, light, and she doesn't mind. Used it because she was a rescue and did not know how she would react to my cat and dog park. She was nothing to worry about but still still great she doesn't mind it one bit. First minute she will claw at it, then after that nothing. Very happy!"
"I played this game with my 5 year old niece who will start kindergarten in the fall when we were on vacation. We loved it! I teach preschool and purchased 2 of them for our preschool. We have other ABC bingo games, but this one has many levels and can involve strategy! It is colorful and holds the attention of the young players."
I just bought this dryer today after my other Conair stopped working. It takes SOOOOOOO LONG for me to dry my hair now...i can barely even feel it! It messes up my hair more than my other one did. As for helping my hair......yeah right. Same ole frizzies as always. I'm going to try and take it back.
"I previously had a Mega which worked a couple years. This one was a Total Disaster. Never could get rake to work, Littermaid customer service (once you finally get to is) was of little help and Orange Onion (don't buy anything from them) sucked. They couldn't care less, at least Littermaid apologized (on one of my three calls). Keep in mind, if you buy it and return it, do it through Littermaid. You only need to send back the battery cover and that blasted pull wire. To get that out ( NO help from Littermaid!), unscrew every single screw and once you get your hands on that wire, don't let it go! Or you have to take out the rest of the screws by the battery compartment. I wasted hours and hours on this. If only they had a good competitor. They're sending me the only thing available, the latest model that most people here seem to hate. sigh..if it doesn't work, I'm giving up totally on Littermaid. I have two cats, so it had its uses."
"My daughter got this as a gift a while back. She really likes it, but the part where you actually make the hair grow (you put play doh in the pony and then push a plunger up into the pony) is really hard. It takes a lot of effort for an adult to push it down all the way. It's almost impossible for a small child. She does love picking out colors and styling the pony's mane. If you are getting this for a kid who REALLY loves pink and My Little Ponies (mine does) they will like it, but still get frustrated with it occasionally (I don't mind helping the hair grow). Otherwise, get another play doh set."
"2 kids later, this is still played with nearly everyday. The cube was dropped on the side with the battery door and now the door is busted and will not play. This happened one other time and I ordered a new door from the company via the internet. I failed to keep record of the address. HELP!! Who knows how to contact the company? I had to hide this in my closet so the kids can't find it!!!!!!!"
"Before ordering, keep in mind that the 2009 World Show Cat Consortium winner made $60,000 plus over $200,000 in endorsements and getting a tattooed Coca Cola ad. This feline skin and fur enhancement utensil is indescribable. If you can afford it, I'm sure you already have one, if not please consider your loser son's college fund fair game. Think of it as an investment.One family on my block has been using it on their siberian tiger and claim their house has been appraised 23% higher than pre-Hagen Bristle feline fur and skin enhancement utensil.A word of note- you may see these on Ebay for $9,000-$15,000 price range but it is a cheap chinese knock off and will give your cat hepatitis-China, and possibly lasers for eyes.Also, this device is sensitive and should never be exposed to sunlight, moisture, moving air, loud noises, food after midnight, vibrations, or handling. If you haven't used one before definitely hire a specialist (Have a servant call Japan and ask for Takashi).I love both of my Hagens, and since I bought them in 2001 they have appreciated in value by roughly 29,900%. Please note that at this rate, plus the winnings from the international cat shows, you could be a billionaire in minutes. Don't be a fool, your cat looks stupid and pathetic without this brush."
I happen to have had this in my cabinet for about two years. Just opened it. WOW for lack of better words. It's amazing! It works like if you just had your hair blown dried at the salon and you do it yourself. I'm at a lost for words. AMazing!!! well worth every penny. I just googled it and you can't find it anymore!! I hit the jackpot. Yeah ME
"I will admit that my favorite perfume brand has always been Hermes. They last long and have very elegant and unique signature. But then, I read in The New Yorker magazine long ago that the creator of the ""First"" perfume is now working for Hermes Perfumes. Out of curiosity I wanted to try Van Cleef & Arpel's perfume. Just as Hermes is known for their Birkin bags and silk scarves, Van Cleef & Arpels brand has earned their name as one of the premiere jewelry designers. If Hermes stole away their perfume creator, then ""First"" must have been his work of art.Sure enough ""First"" is everything I have hoped for and more. It comes in elegant box, the bottle is breathtaking which makes it beautiful for display and for a present if you are intending it for someone else. But the scent is unmistakably unique, long lasting and essence of elegance. It is for mature women and not for casual wear. I do not beileve it would suit young women well. This perfume is all about sophistication, style and poise.Over the years I have been regular customer of Beauty Encounter. One can find great, genuine products on their web site at great prices, service is excellent and there is always free samples included with your purchases, for an even better satisfaction. This was a kind of purchase I do not regret and I look forward to in the future."
This product has a smell that you cna not mask. i don't know what it is but it just sits on my hair. I wll not buy this again.
"I have three cats--one who's diabetic and one's who's just thirsty!--and have owned both of these. All my cats liked the drinkwell fountain--it made a noise like running water when the water fell into the bowl, and that attracted them. But the motor gave out, so I tried a petmate"
"I was very unsure how this was going to work when we first ordered this, or if the cats were even going to like it. We have four cats, all different ages. We at one point had four litterboxes, which was a stinking, embarrassing mess. The cats took to this box right away, and it has been a huge blessing. It is as easy as described to use and clean. Like any other litter box, it still needs to be thoroughly cleaned out and have litter levels maintained, but lets face it, rolling a box and emptying the sleeve is alot better than messy scooping. Our cats and our noses are happy!!"
"I've always been fasinated by Yoda's strength in the force until Attack of the Clones he never fought. After I did see him fight I wanted to get a toy of Yoda to fight Dooku with. When I got Yoda I was excited. He is very fun and durable.He come with a stand that makes him levitate , his mini lightsaber, his cane, and force action that wraps around his hand."
"Bought this as a part of the Booda dome cat liter system. Placed the filter in and there was no smell, thought it was just because the liter box was covered nicely and didn't know it was working until it was time to change the filter. It does work! It won't completely eliminate odor, but it does make a significant difference. Recommended."
I think it is a bit heavy after being soaked in cool waterIt seems to weigh our 70 pound Golden down
"My dogs love this product. They beg for them. Arrived in a shipment of other items, packaged well, received in good order."
"We bought this 4 months ago, as an add'l day bed for our vizsla to use upstairs. The seams have begun to come undone in two places with only light - moderate use. I haven't even tried to wash it yet."
"Absolutely love these. Got two before moving (flying) across country with our cats from Seattle to NYC. They fit perfectly under the airline seats so that we were able to keep our babies near us (which was especially important to us since one of our cats was 16 years old at the time). Very soft and cozy insert which is also washable. Love the privacy flaps with plenty of easy air circulation for them. Our fattest cat fit in easily with space to move around. Shoulder straps make them easy to carry. What I especially love about the design of this bag is that it is unassuming, so that no one really knows you have your pet inside (unless they cry, meow, bark, etc). Great product!"
LOVE IT! JUST WHAT I NEEDED! IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ANYWHERE ELSE! BUY LOTS! GREAT PRODUCT! NATURALLY HEALTHY TO USE .. INSTEAD OF CHEMICAL RELEASING POLISHES!!!
My Grandaughter and I have played this game for two years and we both enjoy it. She is ten now.
I don't feel the product did anything that I was led to believe. Probally would try a different product. It did arrive in a timely manor.
"my dogs love the taste, their coats look like they have rubbed around in baby oil their coats are so shiny. hasn't completely eliminated shedding, but i do notice less of it on the hardwood floors."
"I work at a vets office and we had a 45 lb. coonhound mix surrendered to us about 2 months ago. He had surgery on his knee so he couldn't run around or play. He was getting so bored! I bought him the large size and it has been amazing for him! He loves it when we put the ""caps"" in the ends or put treats in the middle. If we put 1 ""cap"" on it, it last at least 3 days! When I recently put both on it lasted him a week! I am so glad we found a way to keep him entertained while he is recovering from his surgery!"
"I must say I really like this cream. Although I don't have a lot of cellulite or dimples, I saw a difference with the use. I will continue to buy this product and use it. Just need a bigger size! :-)"
"I noticed my puppy, a 6 month old Border Collie/Pointer/Lab mix, was inhaling her dog food from a bowl. I am trying to provide a variety of items to put her mesls in to prevent it. I put 1/2 cup of food in this ball. We also throw it across the room and chase it down when it's empty. She as fun with it. When there is only a few kibbles left they don't drop out as easily.We also put 1/4 cup of food in Premier Twist and Treat Dog Toyhttp://www.amazon.com/Premier-Buddy-Twist-Treat-Small/dp/B0002I0RLW/ref=pd_ys_home_shvl_110 which she likes because she doesn't have to do much but push it with her nose.Reagan is happy to work for her food and if I put food in her bowl and fill up a few toys with the rest of her food she goes for the toys fist every time. Reagan is about 26 pounds so far and I got her the large. She can pick it up with her mouth and give it a throw but she can't carry it around quite yet."
"My 4 1/2 year old got this for Christmas. He can't transform it, but I can. I'm actually quite a pro at it now and my 7 year old usually gets it. The auto-transform feature is neat, except that sometimes it starts transforming when you don't want it to.If your kids have any transformers you know that some parts can come off and many have on ours. He still transforms and looks cool enough for my kids.Personally, I don't think it's worth the price, but kids really seem to enjoy Transformers. It's a good toy for grandparents who want to do a little spoiling."
My german shepherd HATES squirrels. They are often her focus when she is outside. This has held up to all of the abuse she can dish out. Its her favorite toy and a good product.
I ordered this toy after reading reviews and I am very happy with what arrived in the mail! My five month old really enjoys playing with the toy and holding it! I would for sure recommend this to someone else!
"This toy is well put together and stands to most wear. Though the wing release wore out fast. My nephew doesn't care about that though. As soon as it arrived, it became has absolute favorite toy. He takes it everywhere. Well worth the price."
"This is a good game, lasting 2-3 hours for teens and adults interested in games of strategy and with good attention spans. This game has lots of variety and will not develop the same way twice (unlike old games like monopoly and risk)."
"This item was a gift for my 4 year old daughter, she loved it for the few weeks that it actually worked. It was one of her ""supervision"" toys so it was only brought down of the toy shelves when I could keep an eye on her. Unfortunately, it stopped being able to ""read"" CD's in just 3 weeks. The microphones still work but it was very disappointing not being able to play CD's.Also this toy eats batteries up! We have a stash of cost co batteries and changed them twice in three weeks.Buy an actual CD player."
"We had to get this toothbrush kit for our cat who has a bad gene pool regarding his teeth. It works just great and the cat doesn't really seem to mind having his teeth brushed at all. After paying $300 to have them cleaned, this is definitely a good investment. If your cat has bad teeth, or even if he doesn't, this is just a good habit to start in your cat's hygiene. It definitely saves on the health bills later!"
"I like a soft bonnet hair drier, because it drys my hair softly not harshly as hand held dryers do. And it leaves my hands free to do other things. This particular one is compact and when everything is packed away, takes up little shelf space. It is very sturdy too and I really like the long hose."
"You SHOULD buy this toy. I think mighty beanz are FUN. This toy is very durable, I threw a mighty bean on a hard, terrazzo floor. It did not break. They are fun becase there is a lot of fun games to play with. Also, my friends have mighty beanz, and we like to trade. You can also buy race tracks and other neat items. I am 8,and I recomend this toy."
This it s very cute and well made toy. My 4 year old daughter is in love with My Little Pony and went just nuts over this collection of 3 breezies in the 3 cart train that rolls across the floor. The breezies are removable.
"I received this as a gift and have it prominantly displayed with other fantasy figures. The sculpture detail is wonderful and the articulation is good. Any more moving parts, and I would think it would be prone to braking. Too bad I cannot find one of these in a 20"" scale."
"Pink Sugar Body Cream is not so much a cream as it is an opaque gel. It jiggles kind of like a Jell-O dessert, and it certainly smells good enough to eat! It absorbs quickly and is not at all heavy. Another plus is that it's richly scented so that you can wear only the body cream and still smell Pink Sugar all day. It has the same bergamot top note which eventually fades into a soft, powdery cotton candy and vanilla aroma. It's great for cold weather, dry skins or as a gift or treat for anyone who loves Pink Sugar."
"Love it, it's a clean, fresh floral scent My boss says it smells like hawaii:)I don't mind that at all:)"
"Great product, Geat price Wish you had more of the Mcfarlane sports figures"
"My nails are growing stronger, but I haven't seen a difference in my hair. I am still going to order another supply just to see."
"We purchased these dog beds because our Great Danes love lying out in the sunshine, wanting to be outside even when the ground is damp or snow covered and dissatisfied when they can't lie down. Regular dog beds become damp and dirty, especially when removed from the concrete and dragged round the garden. Using the Coolaroo meant that their beds could be kept off the ground most of the time. Having encountered rattlesnakes warming themselves on the concrete on a couple of occasions, the fact that the dogs can relax off the ground provides some reassurance.I didn't find the assembly as easy as I had hoped, I needed another couple of hands to hold things straight and you need to make sure the feet are the right way round in order to insert the screws in the more concave surface. I'm not sure if I missed this instruction or if it wasn't there.The dogs took a little while to get used to stepping up onto the beds and were initially worried by the flexing of the surface, but they seem to have mastered the technique now. Leggy, short haired dogs like Danes rub their fur off and get callouses easily on hard surfaces so the Coolaroo provides a good solution to this problem."
I now have six of these in my yard which is mostly bark. All the neighborhood cats found my yard most appealing. They don't anymore!!
Don't let the 'some assembly' worry you
"You know this stuff, you just have to reach way into your gray matter to pull it out. Do you know what celebrity couple named their daughter Scout after a character from &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;? Can you incorrectly spell the word &quot;potato&quot; just like Dan Quayle did? Your categories are Movies, TV, Music, Books and Pop Pourri. Shouting out like a bad first grader, you want to be the first to answer a question in one of each of the categories. Comes with randomizer (like a spinner, but more fun), 30 plastic pegs, 200 cards, one wipe-off scorecard, a crayon and a really funny instruction booklet. The TV-shaped gamebox is also quite amusing. (And the answers are? Demi Moore &amp; Bruce Willis and &quot;potatoe.&quot;) For 2 or more players."
"I have tried many different shampoos, even prescription ones that cost 120 dollars per bottle! None of them took care of the intense itching, heavy flaking, redness, and scaling. I found this one at CVS pharmacy. I thought I'd try it knowing that it just wouldn't work. The first time I tried it, I loved it. The itching is gone! The scaling and redness are gone. There is still a tiny bit of flaking, but not much. I use it 2 times a week and do a VO5 Hot Oil treatment in between. My hair is shinny and my scalp doesn't keep me awake all night. I highly recommend this product."
"My 5 1/2 year old loves to play with his star wars transformer. He figured it our without our help, and a month later he still plays with it a lot"
"good lotion, but smells just like sun block. the whole reason for me to purchase this lotion was to have sun block on mt kids arm during the the day....with out smelling like sun block.. i wish they could change the odor to something more pleasent. i could have just bought regulat sun block, if i had known."
"My son received this for his first birthday. He wasn't quite tall enough to ride it, but all of the fun levers and buttons kept him happy while watching his big brother run and ride on his own toys. He is now nearly two and this toy is still a favorite. It has held up beautifully and my almost 3 yr old son rides it as well. My only complaint is that the handle/backrest/push bar doesn't attach securely to the train so it pulls out, this is most annoying when I'm carrying the ride on across the street and the train detaches from the handle and falls to the ground. Other than that, this is a great toy!"
"This little atomizer is great! If you like Dior's Poison parfume, you'll like this version. It is an excellent complement to the parfume and body wash, and lotion. Plus it fits in your purse or pocket, without leaving a bulge, it's as small as a lipstick! It leaves your skin smelling great! I love this stuff!!!"
"Love this, great for a 2 month old, but the mp3 wire is kind of faulty which is worrysome. Bascially, the music doesn't flow freely in ours."
"This is the only thing that got my son to sleep from ages 1 to 4 months. I still use it for naps. The song has an auto shutoff (plays for about 15 min) which is nice. I used this so much, I must've changed the batteries in it at least 4 times. Now that he is 4 months old, he can now enjoy playing with the features on the toy."
"This is my second ScoopFree. It's a lazy person's litter box! I change the litter tray on the 1st then ignore it for 30 days. Can't beat that. Much quieter than other electronic box I had. Other one was messier too, changing the plastic receptical for the other one ended up spewing litter (used) all over the place. Yuck! With the ScoopFree the litter sits in a disposable tray that you toss out every month. Refill trays a little pricey but well worth it to me. Cat likes it too. Highly recommend this box."
"I have sensitive, acne prone skin and have been searching for a moisturizer that doesn't make me break out, turn red (due to skin irritation), or leave my face looking perpetually greasy. I finally came across Philosophy's Hope in a Jar moisturizer and it's amazing. The product makes my pores look smaller, evens out my skin tone, and makes my face look healthy rather than greasy. The lactic acid in the product helps clear up scarring and removes dead, superficial layers of skin to reveal healthy skin and prevent pore-clogging and breakouts. The product is expensive, but a very very small bit of the moisturizer goes a long way."
"With almost-shoulder length curly but frizzy hair (not pretty), I needed something to smooth and defriz for 48hours. The super jumbo size rollers work very well for both. The set heats up quickly. The clips are a little difficult to work with and the rollers are hot to handle but that is worth the results."
We love it! Bought it for my daughter for a plane trip to FL and it kept her organized and is compact enough for her to keep up with!
I bought this frisbee after my dog chewed through dozens of frisbees purchased at Wal-Mart. It is tough and strong - no more puncture marks! It's also very easy to throw - well worth the price for a frisbee-loving dog.
"I brought this for my friend name Brian, for his birthday I figured he needed his very own Jasper!"
This was a santa present for my 20 month old daughter. She absolutley enjoys rocking on this horse. It is a very good looking toy and is made well.
"This one works, but it's tough to get the teeth to grab to the hair. You need more tension to get it to make hair smooth and straight. Needs more manual assist than I thought."
"I am so grateful for the Premier Spray Sense Anti Bark Collar. I live in a Senior high rise that allows dogs, but has strict rules. Barking is a big no-no. My little Maltese/Shih Tsu mix goes for weeks with no problem, then has spells when she barks and cries constantly with great volume when I leave her. The bark collar stopped the barking immediately and, I was happy to find, it also works to stop her from crying loudly. She has also stopped clawing and snorting at the crack under the door. She seems a little more subdued than I would like, but still, it's such a blessing to know I can leave and my neighbors won't be glowering at me when I return home. I don't use it on our walks because I respect her ""right to bark"". I've been squirted by the collar a couple of times when cuddling her and chirping ""good dog"" in her ear. It didn't hurt or sting, just startled me. I'm also grateful that I can turn it off and on, saving the battery."

"I have used Pureology products for almost 2 years but never tried this one until recently. I love it. I don't use the conditioner, but the shampoo is great. One of the reasons I color my hair is for the added volume it gives. Towards the last 2 weeks prior to my appointment my hair always is flat. I have lived with it in the past in order to avoid over processing, but with this product I feel the need to color as needed from an appearance stand point. Try it."
"I often purchase sample vials of my favorite scents for travel...and this product was no different. Shipped quickly, received in good condition. I highly recommend this as an option to buying larger bottles of higher end scents."
I installed as the directions stated to do and proceeded to put my two 60 pound dogs in the back of my SUV. By the time I came over to sit in drivers seat they had broke through it! I followed some of the reviewers advice and purchased different screws to make barrier stronger...this time it took they about a few seconds more to break it down!!! I am going to get a refund-this is NOT for big dogs maybe it would hold back a Chihuahua !!
"We have a 1.12 pound puppy (pomeranian puppy), and she recently started hacking, like she was trying to clear her throat. We couldn't figure out the source for this, until we found that the stitching on the INSIDE of this toy (the log, where the squirrels go) was not properly sewn, and there was exposed stuffing along the inside of this log/toy. She had been eating the stuffing! Lo and behold, when we took this toy away the hacking has almost completely gone away. She is ITTY BITTY and not an aggressive chewer, but with any puppy, if they can eat the stuffing and it's exposed they will do it. For the price, I am extremely disappointed! I thought this would be a high quality toy, and found out the hard way that it is not. BE CAREFUL PURCHASING THIS TOY."
"I bought this game for my pre-teens and they like it a lot. Theres so many different ways to look at the same tiles that it really gets the brain working. The tiles are very durable--like lighter weight dominoes. The stands are less durable, but good quality in a game. We've played it many times and still enjoy getting it out."
"This is a great flat iron for the price. In my opinion it works better than a chi,for half the price :) very satisfied"
I have natural African American hair and using a wide tooth comb is a must. I tried two other regular wide tooths but they still pulled at my hair. Got this because the wavy teeth pattern seemed better for my curls and boy was i right! Works perfect and does not pull my hair out at all. Great if you have thick curly hair.
This hand cream is the best! It goes into your skin quickly and leaves it feeling so smooth!
"We bought this for my 1 year old and while she really loves to play with it, she gets bored quickly. She'd rather walk around with the little people in her mouth. I think as she gets older, it will be a great learning tool for her. The Zoo is just precious."
"I used the comb regularly for about 3 months and did not see any noticable changes in my hair thickness. Perhaps I needed to use it longer, I don't know.For me, it caused acne breakouts on my scalp which continued to get worse. As a result it sort of hurt when I used the comb. Finally I stopped using it and in about 4-5 days my scalp cleared up completely.In general, I have acne prone skin, but I'd never had scalp problems like that before.Also, for me the comb often gave me a slight headache.Questionable product...."
"My puppy is a Siberian Husky. They are bred to PULL. Well I bought this and it was like night and day, the FIRST TIME I WALKED HER ON IT. It's great! Now, she hardly pulls at all, and only does so when she forgets she is on a leash. Buy it. You wont be diappointed."
i though when i bought this chi i thought it was going to work like magic and one strip of my hair would be thin and silky well i was wrng it takes alot of work and alot of burning hair my hair was already burned from last straightener now this!!!! Well then i had my dad buy the conditioning stu on here for chi better results my hair was how i imagened and i was real happy with my hair but its not easy for an 12 year old girl to straighten hair but basicly im telling you to buy the chi conditioning with it it will have better results-kayla!!!
These blocks make me very nervous when it comes to my one year old son. He loves to chew on these blocks. So far he has left lots of teeth marks on the blocks but I am afraid one day there will be a chunk missing from one of them. Definately require very close supervision.
This is a great product that has worked well for me. My wife loves the smell and I receive compliments on it on a regular basis.
"Camera sounded alright for the price for a child. Then take it out of the package---disaster. Battery thing came undone and batteries would fall out, which would then reset the camera and lose all the pictures on it. Downloading the pictures on the computer was very difficult compared to our digital camera. Let's say it is in the garbage now since it just stopped working."
"This is not a dog toy, this should be sold as a stuffed animal to put on a shelf. In less than 30 seconds my dogs had all the stuffing out of this toy and the tail was ripped from the body. I don't know what they sewed the seams with but it needed to be reinforced. Very disappointed!"
This sucker is going to be a huge classic. I really like my governor!
"This is the first time I've owned a cat. Along with that is a huge learning experience. One of those learning experiences has to do with the litter box. The first box I bought was just a cheap plastic box. No matter what litter I bought, it was a pain in the neck to clean, not to mention disgusting! I hated searching through the litter for any small clumps, it smelled, and it was a huge waste of litter. I saw this litter box online when I was searching for something better. I did a lot of research, but the only boxes comparable to the function were the $100-200 automatic boxes. I wasn't interesterested in paying that much for something that my cat was just going to use the bathroom in!! I had my doubts, but knew with Amazon's easy return policy that it was worth a shot.I received the package quickly, set it up, and waited. My cat used it, no problem, and the high opening and covered box help keep the litter and smell in. I rolled the box just as instructed. It worked great!! The only two problems I have are, one, the urine clumps still stick to the bottom, so I have to scrape them loose, then roll. Two, I was unsure of the size, so I bought a large. I should have bought a small or medium!! The large is huge! It takes up a lot of space! And you have to leave room to roll it! Other than that, there is no way I would go back to a regular box again! I love this thing! Great invention!"
I have found this Laugh and Learn Cuddly Puppy is a great gift and I know that my Great Granddaughter will realy like it and learn from the many differt things that it can say I got it for her Birthday which she will be 1 year old in June.Charlie F Foster
I am very happy with this! The litterbox is hidden and my cat loves it. It is pure white and looks so nice inside my bathroom. I was supprised it was not damaged during shipment cause it was poorly packaged but it was perfect. I am gonna recomend to all the cat lovers i know.
"I am a real fan from lost series me and my wife,we realy are lost,and she favorite is JACK ,tht's why i GET THIS TOY FOR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR HER SHE LIKE JACK,we love the show n all episodes now my family watch it WOW. We love every toys brand from McFarlane he is doing a great job well I'M LOST NOW. PC"
"This has been a great investment for our puppy! She is able to have everything she needs in there and seems to like her own space. We used puppy piddle pads for the first two weeks. Now, we have removed them and she doesn't have accidents in her ""house""! It has been a life saver. We started using this when she was 7 weeks old. It is nice quality and am so happy we purchased it. I would recommend this to anyone who has a puppy or pet. Much more space. We put her bed, kennel, food and water, and toys in there. She is able to choose where she is and protects your house while still training your puppy! Great product."
"My only complaint about this product is the lack of corresponding materials. But this is a huge complaint! My son loves the animals book but the others are not exciting enough to hold his attention. Also, all the character books (Wiggles, Dora, Elmo, Dr. Suess) only come for the My First Leap pad. When we are in stores, he shows a lot of interest in these other books. Had I been aware of this, I would have skipped this step in the leap frog path."
"Ouija boards, at one time, were mysterious and mystical to play. This new version has a great box and cover, recalling those intense hours of the future of my youth. the contents in this version is cheap, made entirely of flimsy cardboard. It does not live up to its promising cover"
"I have a Westie mix who is prone to anxiety barking when I leave him alone. These symptoms intensified when we moved. Couple this with a cranky neighbor and I was beyond myself with stress. I hated to even leave the house!I actually bought two of these and wanted to share with you what I think went wrong with the first one since some reviewers are having problems with it not working. I had the first one for about a week. Everything was great--the results were immediate. And then, suddenly, it stopped working. Of course I no longer had the receipt, so I couldn't return it to the pet shop where I bought it (btw, do purchase it online because at a pet store it costs almost twice as much). Out of desperation, I decided to try again with another one. When I was filling it, some spray was coming out, making me think that it was full. But then I saw in the directions that you cannot overfill it and, when more pressure was applied, the citronella spray didn't sputter out. On a whim I went back to the old one, which I still had. Sure enough, I filled it as per the instructions and it worked. Basically, I wasn't putting enough spray in when I thought I was overfilling it.Also, for those worried about whether this causes stress for the dog, I can tell you that in my case I think it really lessened my dog's stress. When I left him alone he would not only bark, but he would also tear the place apart, getting into trash cans, etc. I think the collar really helps because it gets his attention and stops him from working himself up into a frenzy. Of course, you still need to exercise your animal and desensitize him to your leaving, but this collar is really a great supplement to that training if you have a constant problem with barking. I couldn't be happier with the results!"
This soap works like it always has. I bought it from Amazon because I can't find it in local stores any more.
"My young male cat needs plenty of exercise & while he doesn't play with these by himself, he loves me throwing them. I bounce them off the ceiling & walls, throw them down the hall & he goes full speed chasing them. He makes sure I get computer breaks to play with him, so we both benefit."
"Extremely well-made ""toy"" with hundreds of precision-fitted parts that are a joy to piece together to form the beautifully detailed ship. Truly stunning and highly recommended! Mega Bloks is a very impressive, high-quality company."
"We received our Buster Food Cube about 2 weeks ago. It is made of sturdy hard plastic with a hole in one side. The core can be removed to allow food to be easily loaded into the cube. The core is then replaced and clicks into place. I takes a bit of twisting to maneuver the food out from under the core, but it's never taken me more than a minute or 2 to get it into place.We have a 10 month old wheaten terrier who is smart but certainly no genius. We filled the cube with a combination of his normal dry food and a few delicious treats to entice him to keep using it. It took him a few hours to really get the hang of it - I had to show him a few times by batting it around but he quickly caught on to the fact that there is food inside. He uses it every day now like a pro. As some reviewers have mentioned this thing is INCREDIBLY loud if you have hard floors - he also bangs it into walls and doors on occasion which makes a real racket. I would recommend it for carpet only. Overall this is a great toy for keeping your dog occupied and make him work, especially when you're not home."
"I gave this toy a 1 star for fun because no one in my house and neighbors has played with it for more than a couple of minutes, Except my 4 year old son battles Kasey and the Fisher Price Resuce Hero robot URV. My 3 year old daughter was fasinated with the display at the store. Trying to avoid buying her more Barbie products, I thought this would be a good choice. It turns out, she is not that interested in its wonderful capabilities. Santa even velcroed a pink bow to his head to feminize it. Oh well, mom enjoys Kasey's humor, but my childrendo not."
"A good way for a beginner to learn chess. My grandaughter, age 7, is learning."
"I wanted the Adventure Team ""Secret Agent"" set as a kid, but only got the cheap ""Undercover Agent"" (not to be confused with this) instead. I was excited to see that they did a repro revival of it. The set comes with a Man of Action style figure (honestly, the only one that the mask really works with). The only piece of equipment missing from the classic set is the revolver/shoulder holster combo. However, they added classic look fragmentation grenades (something that was phased out of the GI Joe line after 1968), binoculars, K-BAR knife/scabbard, flashlight, and map/mapcase. The real reason to get this is theFrom Russia with Love [Blu-ray]inspired briefcase that includes the modified Luger p-08 and a small wiretap recorder. The P-08, with its removable stock and silenced barrel extension draws its inspiration from the AR-7 inFrom Russia with Love [Blu-ray] andGoldfinger [Blu-ray], as well as the modified Walther-P-38 fromThe Man from U.N.C.L.E."
"My son hates tummy time. Everytime we put him down he'd fuss and kick. His grandmother got him this for Christmas, and he'll spend a good 10 minutes (which is a record for not complaining about being put down in general)pushing himself up to talk to the 'mirror baby'.The ONLY thing I'm not crazy about with this toy - the buttons in the tags are a little hard to activate. You have to find just where the right spot is to make the noise. If I have to poke around, I'm sure it's a little more frustrating for a 4 month old!"
"The Mickey Mouse Clubhouse binoculars are useless. My 2.5 yr old love the way it looks, but it has absolutely no functionality. Doesn't even have a 2x zoom, just basically 2 pieces of cheap plastic pieces serve as 'lens' and I feel completely ripped off.My son also has the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse Funlight flash lihgt... Another useless piece of junk. No 'off' button and the lights are really low quality, especially the 'footprints' light is so out of focus that you can hardly tell they're supposed to be footprints...Overall Mickey The Rat Crackhouse toys are overpriced, useless and don't work at all."
"It has been quite a while since I sat down to play the Game of Life, but when my 7 year old granddaughter brought it over we all gave in and played. It brought back a lot of memories and was really fun to play again and you know when my house was hit by a storm I was glad I had purchased insurance.....gee just like real life living in Florida :0)....I promised I would be honest in this review and tell you that my granddaughter won the game.....I can only say that I hope that is how her life will be ...with her as a true winner. Bottom line---a game that is fun to play with the whole family and really does teach a little bit about life."
"I know this could be educational someday but right now it's just for fun. We bought this for our three-year old for Christmas. He loves having the glow-in-the-dark stars on his ceiling but now he has a moon in his room too. He loves it and has to show it to everyone who comes to our house. Tonight, he even mentioned that he wants to go to the moon someday. I love that this has a remote and that it turns off after 30 minutes (I think). This is exactly what I was expecting so I don't have anything negative to write."
There is nothing special about this product it is just regular shampoo and it made my scalp dry my hair didn't even grow
"I had to do this with a few of my kids' other tub toys since I hated throwign them out because of mold getting inside them. Before ever putting them in my the tub, I get out my glue gun and fill the holes. It works great! It also helps certain toys float better. We don't use the Dora in the tub as much as we use it out of the tub."
"Are you constantly searching for a toy your cat will love? Give this one a try! My one year old cat loves to play and I find myself constantly looking for new things to entertain her. This was it! We got the toy two days ago and she went after 'da bird' immediately. She has only had 4 play-sessions with the toy so far and now I have a new problem...she won't move away from the closet when I put the toy away! Also, be sure and buy the toy that comes with a few replacement birdies, I have a feeling 'da bird' is not going to last very long once the cat gets it alone."
"My daughter is into horses of all shapes, sizes and colors. She loved this pony right out of the package. Our webkinz are abused with hugs and dragging from place to place and they hold up well. I am sure this one will do the same."
"This toy was given to my son when he was 4months old. He has loved it sence the moment I put him in it. The toy has also grown with him. Now that he is 1year, I took the seat out and he loves to run back and forth along the keys. I would recommend this toy to everyone."
"I have narrow shoulders and a big bust. Have always had problems with bra straps staying up. I had once found an adhesive through a cosmetic company that worked well but could not find it again. So I searched through Amazon and found the IT Stays Body Adhesive.I have used it several times now and it works well, but not as well as the former product. It definitely holds the straps in place for a while, but after moving around the straps have come ""unstuck."" I am going to try using more adhesive and see how that works. The ""roll-on"" ball is a great way to apply it. You don't end up with tons of goo on your body."
"After reading the review about the errors in the written Spanish, I still bought the product, thinking that its only value anyway for my child would be in hearing the Spanish spoken, since my son doesn't even read yet. However, despite the fact it carries the Leap Frog name, there is nothing Leap Frog about this product. It has no auditory component at all, so all you have is a simple memory game with Spanish words. Would have been a great item if it had been part of Leap Frog Tag or Tag Junior. When I contacted Leap Frog, they disowned it, saying it was made by another company although I'm sure that they got some money from the licensing of their name!"
"I got tired of always buying the little bottles of Brut and when I saw this bottle on line, I immediately purchased it. I can't imagine ever needing to buy another since it was so large. The price was very good and the service and delivery were excellent. Thank you"
"I normally do not take the time to write reviews, but we all had such a great time playing Wit's End, so I figured what the heck....Anyway, we found this game by accident when buying the Junior version of the game for our kids. But while I was buying the kids game, I thought why not buy us adults something to keep us entertained. The game is centered around different brain teasers. During your turn you will answer 1 of 4 question types. Where you land on the board (and you can strategically decide where to land) determines what type of question you will answer. The Teaser category challenges you to find the relationship; the Odd-1-Out category asks you to decide which item, term, person or place does not belong; the Sequence category asks you to put everything imaginable into sequences; and the Wild Card Category mixes different types of challenges, such as naming famous songs, identifying famous quotes, etc.. The questions are fun and we had a blast answering them. We highly recommend Wit's End, it had an edge over other Trivia games we have played."
When I wear this perfume everybody grabs me and asks what it is!!It is so yummy!!I even bought it for my daughters kindergarten teacher cause she would comment every timeI had it onAwesome product!!
"I bought this product for my 3-month-old kitten. They were easy to apply (I glued them on while she was napping) and she didn't even notice they were there when she woke up. They were very effective for preventing scratching. HOWEVER, we have many rugs with looped carpeting and she gets her nail caps caught in the loops several times every day. I was only able to work her claw out two times.....the other 20+ times I have had to cut the yarn in the rug to get her out. Just a few minutes ago she got caught (for the second time in less than one minute) and she started rolling around and got her arm twisted behind her in a way that makes me wonder how she may have injured herself had I not been right there to help her. Now I worry every time I have to leave her alone because I'm afraid she will hurt herself. I can't get the caps off (I tried nail polish remover)."
"I bought this back in july, ive had it a few months and my dogs love it! its good quality, very quiet, and supplies fresh cool water. make sure if youve got very small dogs like me you clean it regularly, they drink so little it gets kinda slimy if the same water has been in there for awhile. But id recommend this to anybody"
"love the title and scent and great for on the go, fits in pocket or purse. I plan to buy more items under this label in future."
"NICE HAIRDRYER.........WORKS WELL AND MEETS MY NEEDS. THE ONY THING IS THE NIGHTLIGHT IT HAS DOESN;T REALLY ILLUMINATE ANYTHING, SO IT DOESN;T REALLY SERVE IT'S PURPOSE.......OTHER THAN THAT...NO COMPLAINTS&iexcl;"
All my granddaughters have played with this toy and findit enjoyable. They learn to sort and it helps with theircoordination and fine motor skills. It is very durable.
I really love this oil. It is thick so easy to use. I really enjoy the smell. Great ingredients. Will definitely order again.
"This piano is great. My daughter used it for the first 18 months and I'm keeping it for my next child. You can hook it to the crib when they're little and then later on, they can sit and use it as a actual piano. It has 3 different settings so it can play music on its own and your baby can use their feet or hands to play the piano. There's so many toys out there these days and I would recommend this to anyone!"
Does Not Flake Or Turn White. Only Need A Little Bit To Get The Job Done. Nice To Be Able To Just Re Order When I get Low Instead Of Finding It In The Store And For A Lot More.
We own two of these cat scratchers - one for each floor of our home. Our cats love them and since we got these posts the cats have stopped clawing our furniture! They love the tall height of the scratcher and these are solid construction and will not tip over
"I bought this toy for my 21 month old thinking she would love it. Like other reviewers, my daughter isn't that interested in her old shape sorter so I thought I would pick up this one, since it seemed more age appropriate and a bit more complicated. My BIG issue with this sorter is that there is no hinge on the lid. My daughter immediately figured out(as most children would) she can simply take the lid off then toss the shapes in the box. The lack of the lid closing takes the challenge away. I was very unipressed. I would wait until a better version comes out before purchasing this product."
"After Vader's and Luke's lightsabers, I was eagerly awaiting Maul's and Obi-Wan's. Well, they went and made Maul's alright, which is this review, but made Qui-Gon's instead? Another green saber?! Jeez!Anyway, Maul's double bladed saber is slightly different from the previous sabers in that it doesn't have the same battle clash noises or light up like the others, which really irked me. Otherwise it looks great on my wall with the others!."
"This scent is fantastic. I am quite picky about cologne. This has exactly what I was looking for in a cologne. It has a musky smell as well as a sweetness that is very important. Another thing I love about it is that it ""is not too much."" My friend said, ""this cologne smells awesome. It is not too much, but is just enough to make you smell great."" It is the bagel of colognes - not too much, but enough to please. I am also a 22-year-old college student (addressing the review that it is an old man cologne) I would say old man colognes are the original Green Polo (which is much stronger than this scent) and other strong, overbearing colognes.Some of my other favorite scents are"
"I don't know how isolated my case is but I found this game very poorly designed. First off the questions are based on the same movies and other Disney related topics over and over again. There isn't nearly enough variety making the game very repetative. Second, some of the cards are miss printed so that the answers don't match the questions. Third, the board was not designed correctly. Like Trivial Pursuit you have to acquire five colors which are red, yellow, purple, green and blue. Every space on the board has a Disney picture outlined in the color of the question to be asked. The problem is, there is no blue outlined spaces on the board. This means you can never be asked a &quot;Blue&quot; question, and you can never acquire the five colors to win the game. I was very dissapointed in this shotty product. You would expect quality from Disney. This game is anything but. I would definitely recommend not buying this game and going with the original version."
If your one of those starwars fans who love clone troopers and vehicles then this the perfect toy for you.It stays together very well and dosen't have to many peices so you don't have to worry much about losing peices. the arc fighter is almost bigger then the repulblic gunship so 30 dallors is not a bad price. this toy is most common at toys r us staores so you don't have to go hunting everywhere.
"I have been looking at these in the pet stores and they are double the price of this one. My dog LOVES to chase tennis balls. I was very happy with the quality and the fact that you do not have to use the Chuck It balls in this. Any regular ball will work, although we did buy the glow in the dark chuck it for nighttime. Whenever my dog sees me pull this out of the cupboard she starts running back as to catch a ball! Worth the purchase!!!"
"At half the cost of Pet Smart or Target, this was a great deal! Although my dachshund won't walk thru the pet door, the walk thru gate is perfect for all members of our household."
"Product is great but what was shipped was different from what was pictured (the description said it would come with a measuring cup and it didn't). The lid on the container received is different from the one pictured, but the container serves the same purpose, it's nice and sturdy and keeps the kibble fresh and free of bugs."
We wanted to get this ball for our Shi Tzu as he loved the one we got from a pet store. Well the same day we got it and gave it to him it quit squeaking. The piece kept falling out if the hole in the back so it doesn't squeak and it had some kind of white powder in it and reeked bad. Don't go cheap but the one at the pet stores.
"This chess set is wonderful, it has inspired at least two children who have been to our home to learn how to play chess.My own children love playing with this set. In addition to playing chess, sometimes they recreate the Fritz and Chesster games they've played and printed from the computer, sometimes they make up puzzles for each other ""Move one piece and put my king into check"", sometimes they haul the chess pieces around the house to do double duty for some other imaginative play venture.I do wish there was some way to weight the pieces, they are hollow plastic with felt bottoms. I've debated opening them up to put sand inside of them, but haven't done so yet. Anyway, I'm not sure how this game would hold up outside on a windy day, but regardless, we have been very pleased with this chess set."
"We bought this for our son when he was 8 months old, and he was immediately fascinated with it. His early favorite was the little &quot;flip book&quot; on the top of the table. He would play with it constantly, and never got tired of it.Well, our son is now 16 months old, and this is STILL one of his favorite toys. He really enjoys running the little train track on top of the table - he especially loves stacking the little blocks that come with this table on the track, then watching them all go around! And because the train track is wind-up, not battery operated, it never runs out of power. (Our son is even beginning to learn how to wind up the track himself!)I can tell our son will get many more months of joy out of this toy. He is just beginning to explore making block towers with the lego blocks that come with it, and lately has had a lot of fun stowing all sorts of toys in the area unerneath the table. Also, the little train has become one of his favorite toys - he runs it all over the house on the floor!Finally, because this toy is easy to disassemble and assemble, and is very sturdy, our son has also found a new game"
I ordered and purchased the Mega Tex product. It was delivered as promised. The product is bringing the results that I had hoped to require. Thumbs up for Amazon and Mega Tex.
"I've been coloring my own hair for almost 10 years, and tried Colorzap after paying a ridiculous amount of shipping for it. First of all, the box was tattered and beaten up, and second of all, the product is horrible. Try Color Oops (which is what I usually used, but wondered if Colorzap would be better). I had a dark brown to blonde ombre, and was going to lighten my hair before going back to red. My blonde ends didn't lighten at all, the middle of my hair is still nearly black, and the top is a patchy, patchy bleach job. It's 10:16pm and I'm considering running to Walmart to grab a box of bleach to try and even out the color. I'm highly disappointed and, to be honest, pretty upset. The product was watery and horrible to spread, and gave me knots worse than a rats nest.Sticking with my Color Oops :("
"I live in an area where people seem to think dogs should be free to roam the neighborhood. Animal Control disagrees (as do I), and they pick up roaming dogs during their working hours, but these highly intelligent neighbors have figured out that their dogs can still roam at all other hours. Since I have to do my jogging in the early morning, I regularly encounter poorly socialized dogs--14 wandering dogs last time I went out. Makes me mad just thinking about it. But anyway, now and then, the dogs are aggressive. I have sprayed 4 different dogs who were being intimidating, and one who was definitely in attack mode. The spray works immediately (I think the motion of walking/jogging gives it enough of a shake). When sprayed, the approaching dog reduces his barking/growling to a confused mumbling sound, then wanders away. I never leave home without my dog spray."
Update
"Faconnable is classical, same good as 15 years ago - I just love this fresh, aromatic, slightly warm scent, accompanied with sandalwood middle and base notes. True gentleman's perfume."
"Many men like that musky-over-bearing-should-be-after-shave smelling designer crap. Wrong. Men should wear what women like because guess what? They're the ones that have to smell us.Givenchy Pi is the best cologne I have worn. I've been wearing for over 5 years now and every time I wear it, I receive compliments.Why it is definitely a cologne, it's subtle. It lasts long. It's sweet smelling with just a kick of spice to it. In my opinion the best fragrant combination and at a decent price. I want to extend my thinks to the lady at the Lazaraus counter for giving me a tester back in '05."
"I am a firm believer that certain things work for some and not others. This did not work for me, unfortunately. My little poop-eater was munching on doodie the whole time."
"I do not like doing my hair. I am mixed with curly hair. I hardly go thru the trouble to straighten it becasue, perms dont take, I hate that burnt hair smell from flat ironing & rollers take too much time, just for a stlye to last until it gets humid. My mother sent me this AND I LOVE LOVE LOVE it. I wash my hair. May or may not air dry, blow dry or even all wet and use this to dry. But it straightenes TOO! And I have a friend who has nornal hair and she loves it. My sister locves using it on both her hair and her sew-in hair. The bad review, cant say what went wrong. But Im on here now looking for one for a friend (because I really dont want to let mine go)."
"I have been using 3 Minute Miracle for several years and have found it gives body and improves the texture of thin hair. It is simple to use when showering - shampoo first, then apply 3 Minute Miracle, and by the time washing the body is done, it's time to rinse out the body builder - simple!"
"Hermes advertises Eau d'Orange Verte for men but this active and very female woman loves it. It has such a clean, citrusy odor that it is ideal for warm weather when too many perfumes become cloying. I even wear it to the gym and the dojo -- one of my partners remarked that I was the best-smelling woman who ever threw him across the room. Again, it does not become cloying even on a very warm body. Sorry, guys, the secret is out and you are going to have to share this along with your boxers, sweatshirts and pajama tops."
"We tried the product at our VET's office. We were very impressed but frankly the price was too high. We went home and priced it on Amazon and found the cost to be much more reasonable so we ordered two of them, one for our own Golden and another for our son's Golden as a Christmas present. They arrived very quickly and we love the product."
For the price this product worked well for me. I have had dark circles under my eyes since childhood. It didn't totally get rid of them but noticably lightened them. I haven't finished the first tube yet so it may even get better.
"They don't explain you not only have to take the can out but then find and put the straw on..not easy with 1,2,3 or 4 dogs on leashes. Then the item does freeze the mess but also the grass. Also you need to turn the item over and freeze the back ""according to the instructions"".. I have been unable to do this. I guess its an art... like... flipping pancakes.The freeze spray does help but don't expect it to be anything like the commercial"
Great for traveling. Very convenient. It is not too large so I can place it in the small ice chest I carry in the car. My dog can get water anytime when we stop on the road.
"My 18-month-old really enjoys this dollhouse. I wasn't sure if she was ready for a dollhouse, but she's starting to get interested in it. She doesn't play too long with it yet, but I'm sure she will as she gets older. This is her first experience with the ""Little People"", too, and they're great. She likes to take the ""mom"" and ""dad"" out of the house, and tuck them in bed with her blankie. It's a great introductory dollhouse, without all the small parts you usually have to worry about with big kid dollhouses. And it's gender neutral, too, which is pleasant to see."
"I'm Back! This time I'm going to try to explain what the game is. Ok lets get started.&quot; Its The year is 1923. You are one of four world famous rival archaeologists who have come to Cairo,Egypt to begin a race against time, nature, and each other, in search of the stolen treasures of the pharaoh. Enter the Vally of the Kings, a world of burning desert heat and blinding sandstorms. Danger lurks in your every step as you dig your way through the dark, damp corridors of ancient tombs. but beware.....the cobra goddess WADJET has gaurded the pharoahs' tombs for over 3000 years.....She awaits your intrusion.....! You will be faced with danger, intrigue, and possible financial ruin. You must use your wits,knowledge, money, and memory to outsmart your rivals and WADJET.....Search for royal tombs of the pharoahs.....learn their secrets.....But don't let anyone else learn yours!&quot;That about covers it doesn't it? I hope you enjoy the game and found my reveiws useful. Look for more of my reveiws in other catagories. look for my bold openion and smiley :o) then you'll know its me...... Enjoy..."
"I have REALLY, REALLY thick hair. To dry my hair in the past I would blow dry the top for about 20 minutes then go sit or do chores and let it air dry for at last 30 minutes. Then if I really needed it dried all the way, which I rarely did, I went back for 20 more minutes under the dryer. My sister in-law said she got a great hair dryer at Christmas for over $100. Well 1, I will never spend that much on a hair dryer and 2, I don't have the money to spend over $100 on a hair dryer!! My daughter ""suffers"" from the same hair as me. So between the two of us we can't dry our hair within an hour at the same time. Well, with this hairdryer I was able to dry my daughter's hair in literally 5 minutes. I timed it. I was able to dry my hair in 8 minutes!! I couldn't believe it. This is the most amazing hair dryer I have ever owned or used!! It is light weight and the buttons are easy to use with one hand. I can't say enough great things about this hair dryer!!"
"This is the classic SET game. You get the cards and instruction book. However, the product description says it includes a durable plastic carrying case when in fact it is just a flimsy plastic tray. My friend's SET game comes in a real carrying case with plastic top, not this tray. Honestly I am just going to throw the tray out and keep the cards together with a rubber band. Other than this description inaccuracy, the cards are great and I know I am going to have a lot of fun playing."
"I brought my Shitsu to the groomer and the vet said to use this shampoo. The groomer raved about how well it helped the pups skin as she bathed him. They are going to use it as their medicated choice for customers. If your pup has skin alergies, use this stuff!"
Product arrived in timely manner in excellent condition. After initial shipment was destroyed by dog I contacted seller and new product was sent next day. Toy was exactly as described in advertisement and was enjoyed as Christmas gift to neice. Thank you for excellent service. Susan
when i recived my order it was the wrong perfume they were quick to respond and get the problem resolved
"This LOTR figure does not create any fun action. If anything, its just another bad guy for the main characters to slaughter. To make this figure more Easterling... it should have included a Katana or a Naginata."
My son loves this Superman toy. He likes the sounds it makes. If it was more posable it would be the perfect toy. My son doesn't like that it can't sit.
I think that the electronic force vibration is cool. I duel my brother who has a jedi saber. He thinks the vibration is neat because his saber only makes sounds and lights up. My friends liked it alot too. When you battle with the saber you feel like you are using the power of the force. It's awesome!
"It's always a bonus when a skin cream has a nice, pleasant aroma. This one certainly fits the bill. I feel great when I apply this cream, and feel it adds a lot of moisture to the skin. It didn't do much as far as anti aging, (reduce wrinkles etc) but for the price, it's better than going to be without trying to improve the skin. Good product for the value."
My daughter has enjoyed this toy since she was 11 months old (that's when she got it). She's 16 months now. You can also use your hands to push the balls into the holes. I think it losens up a bit (not in a bad way) over time.
"I purchased two of these for myself and a friend. It comes with a sponge and brush head - we both discovered we much preferred the job done by the brush. I ordered replacement heads (two brushes, 3 sponges) and received 5 sponges. After contacting the company direct, it would appear that the brush heads are no longer available for purchase, I've been trying for months. The overall kit get's an OK rating, not great, but not the worst(and I have tried others). However, once the existing brush is no-good, the machine becomes obsolete as it is the only tool I use in the kit."
I got this product because of its amazing reviews from amazon customers. WOW. They were wrong.I got this chunk of cardboard home and my cat wanted nothing to do with it until I added the catnip that comes with it. Then he was interested in licking it and rubbing his body on it. I made the mistake of putting this setup on my rug so as his body weight tip the box it fell in the rug along with the catnip that now the cat is destroying my rug to get to.I don't suggest this product for any cat as this ingesting cardboard cannot be healthy for cats.
The blocks were ordered for the 1st. Birthday for our Grandson. What a hit. He loves building (and destroying_ with the blocks.
"Unlike many harried parents, my husband and I refused to give up our love for gourmet cooking when we had our baby. She is now one year old and has spent many, many hours beside me in the kitchen. Keeping her entertained was becoming challenging as she began to crawl and wanted to explore every inch of the kitchen.But even with her one-year-old attention span, this toy keeps her busy and entertained for a relatively long time! I don't even mind the little song after hearing it several ""million"" times. IN fact, my husband and I sing and dance to it - which only increases her delight in the toy!"
"harry potter uno is so much fun! my friends and i played it all the time this past summer, when we weren't busy building or running shows (we worked @ a summer theatre)."
"this is good product. I bought it to go with the le bistro automatic pet feeder, so they would match. It is much larger than the feeded. The water usually needs changing well before it is empty. Would choose smaller 1 1/2 g size. Seems like it would be a little easier to maintain and clean."
"We love Ticket to Ride, and this expansion set was a great addition. The bigger cards are nice to have and the new destinations throw a twist into the ""same old, same old."" Still, we love the game with or without the new cards."
"Came on the exact estimated date. Very precise. Love the bottle and scent. The floral scentis great..I didn't like the cap because it takes a couple times to take it off.lol If you got nice,silky hair this is beyond great! I got that mexican,filipino hair so it takes time to wear this stuff. Got to let my hair do grow first. First item bought from this website. Never used Amazon before. Amazon is okay. I didn't like the shipping cost......"
its a really fun toy for kids a bove 8 years old and deserves a good rating
"They have these puppies at my daughter's infant daycare, and they are a huge hit with the 6-9 month old babies. Just like the other reviewer said, the babies try to stuff the bone-shaped mallet (which is attached so it can't get lost) into their mouths. Because the other babies like this toy so much, I went ahead and ordered it for my baby."
"This is a great product for a certain hair styles. If you comb your hair with a brush, forget it, it's too sticky. This is designed for people who want a messy or semi-messy look (messy but look fixed) where you only use your hands and fingers. In that case, it has superb hold. It does remain somewhat sticky and stays that way the whole day. It gives a semi-glossy look that looks a little wet. It actually works best when your hair is completely dry or a bit wet. It smells like pina colada. Great stuff, but not for everyone."
"I used to keep my cat and dog food in a plastic rubbermaid storage container...during the summer I would get ants and the rubbermaid container was too big...it was one of those under bed ones because of the layout of my pantry. This thing fit in perfectly, holds a lot more food and seals tight...no more ants. My only problem is that it is a bit expensive for a plastic container....but it works perfectly and the lid spins on and off easily. Now it's out of sight and out of mind, until it's time to feed the animals."
"My dog was on a bland diet (boiled chicken & rice) so his poop was usually solid but a few days after eating 1 Greenie a day, his poop became more liquid-y and green. Not sure if Greenies was actually the cause until I googled and read on various dog forums about how Greenies have affected other dogs. Stopped giving out my dog Greenies and have thrown them away. BEWARE, Greenies CAN be bad, so watch your dog after giving them out."
"Searched the internet high and low to find this product after purchasing it at WalMart originally, and they no longer carried it when I went back for more.My parents are elderly with severe dry skin conditions as a result of illnesses, and this is the only product that has healed their skin. I also have severely dry skin and have tried every product out there in an attempt to have soft, smooth skin. This works! No need to waste your money on fancy, high dollar products any more!The other Tree Hut products are nice, but this particular ginger product is amazing. I buy it by the cases and give to all my friends and family, and they love it and rave about it.My boyfriend tells me my skin is as soft as a baby's bottom, and that I have the softest skin he has ever felt! It truly is wonderful.The scent is quite strong however. I personally really like the scent but it is strong and could conflict with colognes.Try it at night after your shower, before bed, and you will feel the soft effects all day the following day. It is heavy, as it is a butter. Also it is great to use with your manicure / pedicure moisture gloves and socks. Works like a dream. I think you will really love this body butter."
"My 8 month old german shepherd is currently in the middle of blowing his coat...received the brush yesterday and within 15 minutes of brushing him, I had a 1 foot tall ball of hair. Works just like it says and feels very sturdy in the hand. Make sure to brush at an angle as shown in the directions on the back, my dog wasn't a fan of the first way I was brushing (horizontal) but when I angled it, he was completely fine and laid down for me."
"I love these rollers. I bought them based on a reccomendation from my director(I moonlight as a stage actor)since I have to curl my hair 5x's a week for a 1959 hairstyle. They're easy to use. Not only do they work great without damaging my hair, on the days we have two shows I don't have to re-curl. The unit starts to steam in a few min. so no more waiting. I'm at the end of four weeks of performance and my hair looks good(really good!) on stage and off because for the first time I'm not frying/burning it to death. I'm a ""Caruso"" steam roller girl for life!"
"I received this item fast, in a good condition. Product is good as well. Aqua Di Gio is my all time favorite perfume.Love it when my husband wears it. Sensual and delicate scent. Recommend it."
"I would have recommended this fountain whole-heartedly when we first purchased it. Our 84 lb shepherd/malamute mix prefers running water, and he loved this fountain. All was wonderful until we introduced a GSD puppy into our home. Around the time she was 3 months old, she started taking the cover off of the filter housing and chewing it up and then taking out the filters and chewing them apart. Even replacing the cover and filters, it still happened. One day I noticed the spout where the water comes out was getting chewed up. Then, she decided she liked to 'play' in the water while we were at work. She started splashing the water out of the bowl with her paws. Along with trying to train her not to, we purchased the tray to go underneath to catch the water. Then one day she splashed all of the water out onto the floor, emptying the reservoir's water onto my kitchen floor. When I arrived home, the fountain was unplugged, drained completely empty, on the opposite side of the kitchen from where it started, and the bottle reservoir was nowhere to be found. I finally located it outside, under the bushes, chewed up (they'd carried it out through the doggy door). I reassembled it, and it was still functional, but the water on the floor had seeped under the cabinets into the dining area and ruined my laminate wood flooring. This could have happened with any refilling water bowl, and I don't blame the manufacturer, but it meant the end of this fountain for my household. I couldn't afford any more damage to my home, and to risk the dogs going without water all day because of her 'playing'. We researched for a week and ended up buying aDog It Fresh and Clear Large Dog Fountain - Dog It 73651water fountain. The filters are completely hidden and internal, the water 'hole' is high off of the ground and difficult to reach with playful paws, and it seems like it would be nearly impossible for the dogs to disassemble it the way they did the big dog fountain. So far this has been a solution for our 'problem' pup.I'm still giving this fountain a good rating. It is easy to clean, relatively quiet and relaxing sounding, and my dogs loved it- had we not gotten the second dog and gone through the puppy phase with this fountain, I'm sure it would have lasted a very long time. The first dog never chewed on it or splashed. And even when we started having to replace parts on it because of the chewing, the parts were readily available and reasonably priced (some on Amazon, some on the manufacturers website).If you have well behaved dogs, I think this fountain is great. But if you have destructo-playful Marley pups, it can be an expensive item to end up in your garage."
My ds just loves the music and how it lights up. He just laughs and gets a great kick out of it. Its a very creative toy for baby.
"Saw Palmetto, the first listed ingredient in Procerin, has been proven many times to reduce the affects of 5 alpha reductase, which in turn decreases the amount of the hormone DHT.This effect is used to help treat BPH as well as help prevent hair loss due to male pattern baldness.Knowing these things I recommend Procerin to my son-in-law. He has used it for almost 6 months and is very happy. He says that he notices less hair falling out in the shower, on his pillow, and on his shirts. I have over heard friends and family comment that it looks like he is growing more hair. At first he did complain about dry mouth, but he was not taking it with the suggested glass of water. Once he increased his fluid intake he has had no problems.Give it try"
This laser toy is great for pets as it is bright so they can see it clearly and has several fun shapes to display.
"Simon Geronimo, Miami...I love to play with my Colbalt Blade, I truely recomend this toy, It's cool, good for tournament, beside has a beautiful sounds and light."
"My 20 month-old daughter got this as a hand-me-down from an older cousin. It's missing half the parts and is still a ton of fun. It's really been great for her hand-eye coordination and I love that the ""barn"" is a great place to keep all the parts together."
"Fun game, but a bit overpriced for the amount of play time you get. You will need to purchase add-ons to expand much beyond 2 players. Each add-on is almost as much as the game. The instructions were adequate but can be improved."
There are a couple nice aspects of this product
It is very fun to play with and learn.
My dermatologist first recommended this cream for an eczema problem on my arm. It is also a great moisturizer if you wash your hands a lot and works in to the skin and dries pretty quickly.
Not only does this leave your hair very dry but it left my hair with an ugly dishwater blonde instead of an actual strawberry blonde. YUCK. Will not buy again.
"I've used this straightener for about 4 years, and it just conked out on me today, a very busy Saturday! I just wish it had a longer life."
"My two girls, ages 9 and 12, got this for Christmas. They love it. Fun to play as a family, too. Although it is a little loud, but I don't find it to be annoying at all.Order it, you won't be sorry!"
"We looked all over for this set and found it on Amazon. So, we were able to purchase this for my son and he was thrilled."
"if you still have a V-flash and a young girl then definatly get her this game, it's worth it, I actually played it with her alot, and a few times without her lol!"
I brought this to try it out because it is all the rave. I was not disappointed. I love it.
"Okay, ladies, want to have that fresh glow without wearing make-up - this is the product for you! LOVE, LOVE, lOVE this product. The light tint matches any skin type and the dewy glow with a little lip gloss is a perfect ready to go look in minutes."
My 17 month old daughter and I love this dollhouse. My 4 year old son likes to play with it too. It is very well made and super cute. Everything fits inside. I even manage to squeeze the Lotta and Lilli dolls in there. It is pricey but worth it for such a unique quality item. It is large so don't expect a small child to be able to carry it around. My daughter even sits on the chair made for the dolls. Very cute!
"I wanted my 9 year old to learn how to play chess and the no stress chess game was a good way to start with. Not very expensive (in case he did not like it). The game has cards that tell him what to do and what to move next. The first time we played, we started out with the cards so he would know what he needed to do. By the 3rd game, he did not need the cards. He liked the game so much that we must have played about 10 times that day.It is a good, fun family game."
"I purchased this item as a gift for my seventeen month-old niece on the strength of its reviews and I was not disappointed. Just like the other reviews, my niece could not put this toy down - even when enticed with other gifts on Christmas day (although a large empty cardboard did momentarily occupy her interest). Short of suspecting the manufacturer with coating the toy with come kind of skin-contact narcotic, I believe that this is an ideal gift for toddlers.Nevertheless, I see an awful lot of the later versions of this toy (meant for slightly older children) at the secondary level stores such as Marshalls for more than half off as well as in thrift stores for around $10 still ""new-in-box"" so perhaps it's really only good for children that still aren't capable of forming coherent sentences (much less words)."
"I have two cats, the little one is just over a year old and the princess, who is about 3-4 years of age. Well the little one decided that she needs to knock over anything with water, glasses, bowls, you name it. We tried the ""untippable"" bowls, but she still managed to put all her weight on it to make the water bowl flip. Every night I would come home from work and there would be water all over the floor and the cats meowing... So finally my wife and I decided let's get a pet fountain and see if that does the trick. Once it arrived the cats knew who the fountain was for, it's amazing how they have that sense when something is for them (then again they have that sense when things are not for them too!) They stood and stared at the water fountain for a good hour or two after it was all set up. The little one took to it quick and started drinking from it. The princess would not stand for change and refused to drink (even obligating to drink from the toilet). I was confused as to why she would do such a thing because ever since she was little she drank out of the bathtub after everytime someone showered... Anyways, I made sure the fountain was the only source of water available to them in hopes the princess would change, and eventually she did, and doesn't mind drinking from the fountain at all. Although, she acts like she is doing something bad everytime she is drinking and is always tense. The little one just sits there and drinks water all day. I have had this fountain for 6 months, and I have to say, no more tipped over bowls and my cats are probably drinking better water than before. There are some negative aspects, if you don't fill it, the motor starts making some weird noise. Also make sure to clean it if it makes any noise too. Overall 5 stars, great product! would recommend to any of my friends."
"I bought one of these for my daughter, and she's really enjoyed it. I'd recommend most of the leappad stuff."
"My husband prefers this product over Rogaine mostly because of price. But he's pretty fussy about his hair, so it must work OK for him."
"I saw this toy at my [...] and decided to suprise my 3&4 year old. This was the best money I have ever spent and would have gladly paid 10x that amount. My sons have found many of their other action figures that fit into the cockpit and even have ones whose hands fit on the steering wheel. I am looking for a Batman figure but they are happy while I searching. The sounds, push button action and missle lauching is perfect for little fingers. There are so many additional features on this toy that they have made this their favorite toy. Buzz and Spiderman have now subcum to BATMAN!!!!!"
"I have the kind of hair that if not dealt with straight out of the shower, it will dry into a frizzy, wavy, unattractive mess. I hate it at all costs. But then I discovered this stuff, tried it, and love it! I have been using it for over 3 years now. I simply apply it to my lightly towel-dried, but still damp hair and then put my hair in a ponytail, and let it air dry as much as it can. Of course, it ends up drying the most when I go to bed and take the ponytail out.The next morning, my hair is frizz free, soft, and manageable. Usually, at this point, I'll run a straightener through my hair with no other ingredients added, and it does wonders. No product build up by avoiding other products, and it's soft and manageable enough that you don't even need other products. My hair will remain straight for a good 3 days before I need to wash it again from oil buildup.The other way I style it, is after applying this after a shower, I apply the Giovanni sunset styling lotion. I let this air dry too, and it dries really fast (definitely within 30 minutes). and I have really crunchy curls and no frizz. I tend to prefer how this looks on me the following day as the curls loosen more and the product loosens up; it ends up looking like I have beachy waves hair.Totally recommend both products, but if I could live with one for the rest of my life, it would be the vitapro fusion. I will seriously cry the day it stops selling, like many of my fave hair products have."
this is a good price for these cards. it was alot of fun openeing each one. i got one loot card landros longshot card for it.
My son loves the toy. It arrived just as described. I was sent numerous emails letting me know the product was on its way.
"Its smells amazing. Not too sweet, not too musky. It's perfect. My husband can't keep his nose away from me when I wear it."
"We love Carcasonne and the river expansion is a great addition, we always play with it. I also recommend getting the River 1 expansion for an extra fun long river."
I am very pleased with the Caruso hair curlers. They were delivered when expected and I was happy purchasing them on the Internet.
I love the smell of this calogne! It's musky and actually is perfect for almost any age. I will definitly buy again once Im out. Stick with the oldies; this has been around since the 80s.
My wife has used Pheromone perfume and cologne for years. It's fragrance is more spicy than floral and the fragrance holds up well. She says anything more than a tiny drop will be overpowering. It does smell sexy!
"This is my all time favorite scent. I do wish it lasted a little longer,though. Fortunately the scent just fades away in a few hours and does not smell horrible the next morning the way so many perfumes I have tried do. Macy's and Nordstrom's no longer carry this perfume in the stores, so I was very happy to be able to get it through Amazon."
WOW....I can't believe how much my cats love this cardboard scratcher. I have one kitty that sleeps on it all the time. I send them to Finland and my son's cat sharpens it's claws and sleeps on it and thats without the catnip. The kitty shreds it until theres a hole in the middle (takes about 3 months)and then hides in the hole! (At least he thinks he's hiding) His cat uses the refills flat on the floor.
"we had the lighter, cheaper ones:[...] and my aussie just ripped right through them. 5 of them.so even though these are a bit expensive for a frisbee, they definitely hold up better. they are a bit heavier, so they fly differently, but still soar pretty far.after 1 week they have some bite marks, but holding up much better. if i were smart i would buy another to keep the wear balanced. but i'm not. i am worried that they won't hold up as long as i'd like them too, but will post a follow-up if i'm disappointed."
"My four-year-old eats and breathes the Justice League, so this will be a big hit at Christmas. I'm glad they are starting to produce some of the supporting characters. I realize that these are bundled action figures, so they won't have lots of accesories, but they packed Green Arrow with no bow. It's a pretty crucial piece of equipment for him; I wish they'd thrown it in. That's my only complaint. They look great otherwise."
buzz buzz cut cut oh what a haircut i got.my whole neighborhood now borrows this.so i would say it works.
I am so happy one of my friends gave me a bottle of this to try. I was completely destroying my hair. This spray has helped me heal my hair.
"I have had two cats for about 3 years and after moving twice one of my cats got rather angry about the whole ordeal and would pee and poop in the corner of the living room and soon after on our bed. Yuck! After trying numerous suggestions that failed, I was pointed towards Dr. Elsey's products. Let me tell you, they're wonderful. Ever since switching to the Cat Attract, knock on wood, my cat has always used the litter box. It's a wonderful feeling knowing that your cat is finally happy. And the way it clumps the pee and is dust-free makes it worth the extra money paid on the fancy litter. Try it and save you cat a trip to the pound!"
This is the best curling iron ever!!! I love it!! Would suggest to anyone to buy this curling iron!
"Too good to be true. Paid $26 for the stuff, and it hardly got out the odor, but my cat continues to pee in the same spot every chance he gets. Nothing short of replacing the carpet will get him to stop, and I can't- I rent. VERY disappointing!"
"I was looking to buy some new perfumes and came across this.... baiugh it based on other reviews and now totally in love with it. This is going in my ""always use"" section :-)"
We have been very happy with our purchase. Our dog has responded quickly and loves the freedom she has when we are out in the yard. The battery life is great and has made it so easy to train our 9 month old puppy.
"The costume is simple, cute and easy to put on, but time will tell how durable (longer than one season?) it is and how well the velcro closures wear. The dog doesn't seem to mind wearing it and she'll look precious as my daughter's sidekick (the hotdog vendor...) on Halloween.FYI"
"I loved the old Jenga game and Uno and thought...wow...a game that has both! After receiving it, the tiles were made out of cheap plastic and when the tower collapsed, it was extremely loud. I ended up donating it to Good Will."
These towelettes smell so great and work just as well. I have used them from getting stains off my son's fouton to simply sanitizing my hands after getting off the subway. I have literally used them to clean everything and anything that needs it- theyre just great and convient. I recommend buying them to anyone!
"I have been using Regenerist for about 8 years and I would not be without. You cannot beat the price at Amazon. It's extremely effective for under the eye and I am told that I don't look my age, and Regenerist is definitely one of the reasons for that. Highly recommend this great product. AMAZON ROCKS!"
"I find most Lush products to be more for fun and entertainment than actually having benefits for the skin.This eye cream isn't really fun or entertaining, and it certainly doesn't perform any miracles around the eye area. Very expensive for a cream that doesn't have visible results. I recommend finding something with anti-aging/anti-wrinkle benefits."
"This is the best product for my purposes--I've tried a number of them, and this one is very good quality, doesn't leak, stays flat and doesn't ravel up when the dog walks on it. I have a 6# Min Pin who is trained to use these pads; we travel extensively, and the ""Ultra Thin"" pad folds up small to fit in my purse, so that we can ""potty"" in any restroom, or stay undetected in any hotel. Because they are Ultra Thin, you may need the Simple Solutions regular pad for a larger dog, but beware the economy pads! They can leak, fluff apart, stick to your dogs feet etc."
"Love this eye mask. It's very soft and has an adjustable strap. It successfully blocks out all of the light in the room, so I find myself reaching for it almost every night."
"I just got mine in the mail last night. Once I got it out of the packaging, I soon realized that there is no external battery pack. You actually plug the included AC adapter directly into a small port on the back of the helicopter. It has a little blinking light while it's charging. And it seems to get a full charge in about an hour (much less than the two hours the manual says it takes).Once charged, I set it on the floor and throttled up. It came up off the ground but went into a bad spin and I had to set it down. After a few minutes of adjusting the knob I honed it to the point where it would take off and land with great stability! No nasty spin, just smooth control. Awesome.Next up, I got my wife to stand at the other end of the room and I practiced flying it over and landing it on her hand. Then taking it off her hand and bringing it back to myself. Then I stepped it up a notch and tried taking off the TV and landing on the couch and then bringing it back.I've already crashed it quite a few times (some pretty bad ones too) and the wings have so far popped back into place. I had to replace one of the rotors but luckily it comes with four extras.You seriously can't help but giggle when you manage to maneuver this thing. It's an awesome toy, a great value and I highly recommend it. I bought one for my dad for fathers day. (by the way, I'm [...] so this is cool for anyone of any age, not just for kids)."
"I was very disappointed to find this toy sagged to the side. The spring has no ""spring"" to it. It just flops there.I was surprised at how small this is. If your cat is not a small kitten she/he will knock it over every time they try to play with it.But of course, that doesn't really matter due to the ""flop"" because my cat couldn't care less about it. I've tried and tried to interest her in it by moving it myself, but the way it just flops around just makes it boring to her.I have had other versions of this toy in the past that kittys love so if you find one elsewhere for a decent price it is worth a try."
"I found this game online because I was looking for the rules on how to play the game. My friends and I were using regular cards and plastic spoons. Then I came across this one. It's great. The spoons are more durable than the regular plastic ones... which helps when 2 people are grabbing for the same spoon. It's a fun game that can cause some arguing over ""i had it first"". Just remember..... it's only a game. Some minor injuries have occurred such as being jabbed by someone's finger nail. We play that you're not out of the game until you spell out the word SPOONS. You get a letter each time you don't get a spoon. Others play that if you don't get a spoon on the first time around, you're out. I would recommend ages 10 and over."
"good toy.if your dog go crazy for squeakers dr noys toy are great.I leave the old sqeakers in the toy every time i put a new one in ,its harder her him to find the one that is still sqeaking .he loves these toys"
My daughter loves her webkins. It teaches responsibility. She has to remember to feed it and put it to bed. It is a great toy.
"""Trivial Pursuit"
All of the kids love this batmobile. Unfortunately we lost the darts the first day. :(
These are the easiest to assemble and use steps every. The dogs both learned to use them at once following some instruction. Assembly was quick. Steps are soft and easy for dogs to cling to on the way up or down without slipping.
I purchased the black light with the Simple Solution Cat cleaner. The light worked great but the cleaner didn't remove the stain. I followed the instructions to no avail...
The newest member of tna total nonstop action wrestling christian cage is awesome to the roster i thing. but i also like the toy and it comes with trish which is even better. this toy has christian in his red pants with his logos on the side. This is a good toy for any captain charsma fan.
Amazing. Especially great for Florida weather affected hair. My salon uses this iron but sells for twice the money.
"I absolutely love this fragrance on my wife. Problem is it doesn't last, otherwise this would be a 5 star handsdown."
"Wether you are a kid, tenager or adult,the Jax Jumbo Sequence Game is the most entertaining game to enjoy in family or with friends, with easy to read instructions and lots and lots of ways to win. Enjoy!!!!!"
"i have a 10 pound weiner dog that barks at any thing and every thing. this collar works great ""finaly some peace and quiet!"" the ony bad thing i could say about it is it's a little on the lage side for him but it dose not seem to slow him down i recomend this product highly."
We have all lost the pegs for our cribbage board. Here is a lifetime replacement. I am going to buy a set for my entire game playing family.
My face feels soooo good but it was not exactly what I had expected. I would purchase again even with the unexpected aspects.
"We have owned a plexidor (2 actually) for about 5 years (the large door version). We have gone through many different brands and this is the best buy far. Granted it is pretty expensive, but you will save money in the long run (in both durability and energy costs).The doors are actually double-pane... almost like a window. We just bought another one for our new house.I would never consider a regular ""flap"" dog door again."
This dryer is like a toy. Not much heat. Not much power. I wanted it to use it for heat conditioning. I was not satisfied
My 2 year old grandson loved playing with this toy. It captivated his attention for hours. He loved hearing the noises it made and actually kept putting his hand up to his ear each time he made the telephone ring.
I have used this product for several years and been happy with it. It can not be found locally any more. I'm happy I can order it on line and buy in quanity.It works well to keep that red tint in my hair. Redhead's color fades faster than any other color.My hair gets dull or too yellow-orange looking without this glaze.
My 19 month old got this for his 1st birthday and he loves it! It is a great learning toy!
"Although the IDEA of this cutter/trimmer is great, with battery power and multiple settings adjusted by a push of a button, the product is VERY sketchy. Seriously reconsider when deciding on it.I have had 3 now in the course of 2 months. First one was DOA, so I exchanged it for another. The 2nd one worked a couple of times, then it shut off on it's own, then turned on by itself, and I could not subsequently shut it back off. Called Conair - which was a terrible experience, with hold times of >20 minutes (thank goodness for speakerphone...) - and they gave me an RMA for an exchange. Free? Hardly. I needed to pay shipping BOTH WAYS (Sent them a check with trimmer #2). Got the new one today in the mail. Does it work? NO. I'm done. Good thing I kept my plug-in Wahl trimmer..."
"These flashing balls really appeal to some of our cats. We hear them whacking them around in the track at night, often when they didn't get their way and extra treats they take it out on these balls ;)"
"I am so blown away by this figure. This is by far my favourite Boba Fett. People say that the new 2010 Boba is better but I disagree. This Boba looks more like he does in the film then any other figure in the Vintage Collection and is just amazing, I'm absolutely blown away. My favourite figure in the OTC!"
"I've used it for about a year. It's the only product that's completely cleared my face up. I never even considered myself having severe acne, but I always had something or other in some place or another. Everything I tried never got rid of *all* of it.What I don't like? It's four steps. Thats a lot of time, many nights I forget to use the last step (to use 10 mins after the toner). I'm not very consistent with using it, which is probably why other things never really worked that well. But it cleared up my acne, if I become too inconstant (not using it at least once a day) acne will pop back up. If I start using it consistently again the acne will clear up pretty fast.I always considered my skin normal, not very oily or dry. My skin never became very dry because of this product. If my skin ever becomes very dry though, I'm pretty quick to apply another lotion to it.Over all though, it works. It works really good. Even when I say screw it and don't follows all of it's rules is still works pretty well. Not prefect, if you don't do everything, but still better than the rest if your inconsistent."
This was great while it lasted. He was so excited when he got it and would spend the days throwing it up in the air and making it squeak. Then he destroyed it a few days later :/EDIT
"This is supposed to replace Wella PhD conditioner. I wish. This doesn't smell nearly as nice (I actually do not like the smell of this and therefore avoid using it) nor does it condition as well. Wella, why did you tinker with success?????"
I bought this and another set for my niece for Christmas. She loves the Ponyville items and this set did not dissapoint her. The pieces are just small enough for her to carry in her hands or pockets which makes it easy to travel with. As with any set with small parts make sure that extremely little ones aren't around when the older child plays with this. The parts are bright and extremely attractive to little eyes...and hands!!
This game is really for any age group. It is simple and fun. I had it growing up and I bought this one for my wife and I to play. We have a great time with this game.
"I bought this because we wanted to purchase a xylophone for our little guy, it was a ""Hot Deal"" and offered free shipping so we could get it delivered quickly since we were ordering baby gates too. It's bright and attractive and our little guy likes banging on it...but it is out of tune, which drives us nuts. I don't expect the world from a kid's xylophone, but it would be nice if the different keys made different sounds -- ideally, progressively going through some type of range. We should have spent the extra $5 for the one from Fisher Price ($14 w/shipping on eBay). My SIL has one of those and it sounds just fine after being well-used for two years."
"These dog treats are wonderful. I have two Shelties and my daughter has two Shiba Inus. All four just love these cookies. All I have to say is ""Cookie Time"" and they come running. Thanks for a great product."
My son really likes this set. We all pick an instrument and march all over the house playing loudly.Re
Is it me or is there actually no Sulfur in this shampoo? It has Triclosan which according to the FDA is under review and has no health benefits aside from treating bacteria in the mouth...hm...?
"We've been fighting ticks all summer. Just got these collars and it worked exactly as described on the package. Ticks gone in a day, new ones dead and not attached. Ordering more now."
"I purchased the Drinkwell Platinum a few months ago and my cats love it. My 3-year old Kadin always drank from the falling stream of water, while my 11-year old Tish drinks from the bowl below. They both drank way more water than they did before, as evidenced in the litter box.I believe the fountain helped Kadin, but alas couldn't stop the blockage building in his bladder- we had to put him down 11/30/08. I think a combination of purchasing this fountain earlier and feeding him different food would've prevented this tragedy.The fountain holds a ton of water. With 2 cats drinking from it in a dry apartment in winter, I didn't have to refill it for about 1 1/2 weeks. The filters last about a month if you rinse it thoroughly 2 weeks in. The design of the new filters, where it segmented so the carbon doesn't settle to the bottom, helps their longevity.I take the whole fountain apart once a month and clean it up with a teeny tiny bit of dish soap. Its very easy to disassemble and reassemble, even the pump is easy. The brush kit that is designed for the fountain is a great convenience, it saves a lot of time and hassle fighting with cleaning tools that don't quite fit or bend right. To unplug, disassemble, clean, reassemble, and refill takes at most 10 minutes, and that's if the cat's playing with the cord and making things difficult. :)I found that cleaning is even easier if you have soft water. The tap water here is VERY hard (and tastes like a swimming pool), so I use the gallon jugs full of filtered water from the grocery store. Its $.80 for the first jug, and $.25 to refill the jug.Of course, now that we're down to one cat I can go a little longer between refills and cleanings.I was so impressed by this product I bought one for my best friend for Christmas. Her kitty had bladder problems too, and he loves to both drink and play in it. She saw the same results in her litter box that I did in mine. I highly recommend this fountain to anyone who owns a cat, and especially anyone who owns a male cat to help avoid bladder and urinary issues."
"I ordered this deck about three days before it came, and I did not pay for the decreased amount of time. This deck fans smoothly in my hand. It also does good ribbon spread and turnovers (card flourishes). When I first took the deck out, it dropped all over the place because the cards are so slippery. This makes it good for thumb fans and ribbon spreads. It feels awesome when I hold it in my hand. It was worth the ten bucks (including shipping), and some time I am going to get the Viper Tally-Ho deck, for people have good product reviews on that. I may even get the ""Ghost/Viper/Tiger"" package. I love this deck!"
"I thought sure my ferret's days were numbered when I saw that he suddenly lost his appetite and was all skin & bones. He was a little hesitant to try the FerretVite at first, but now that he's hooked on it, he gets a good capful a day. Now he's almost back to his former weight and his energy level has spiked! I plan on continuing to give it to him, as it not only pumps him full of calories & vitamins--it stimulates his appetite & makes him eat at least as much ferret food as he used to. I'm so glad he'll be bouncing around my living room for awhile longer."
"My kids (ages 5 & 8) have really enjoyed this. It's like an electronic version of Mad Libs. Instead of writing your answers, you get to record your own voice. It took the 5 year-old a few tries to get the hang of doing this, but now she's really enjoying it. My only criticism is that you're limited to the 10 or so set stories."
"I have used this for years to keep my nails hard and strong - I am a ""fingerstyle"" guitarist and my nails take a beating - this stuff keeps me playing."
"After seeing the Gentle Leader in action before I got my own dog, I was already convinced that it would work. My dog (a 40 lb. rescue) is a puller, and while I originally got a harness for him, I felt that the Gentle Leader would ultimately be the best thing to use. It arrived today, and the difference was instantaneous. Sure, he's not a fan of the feeling on his face (he paws at it trying to get it off) but the walks have been more leisurely and enjoyable - I walk at MY pace, not his. Before when I had to hold the leash tightly wrapped around my hand, now I can literally hold it between two fingers. I'm hopeful that my pet will adjust to the feeling of the collar on his face, but this is definitely the way to go if you have a dog that needs just a little more control on your walks."

"I bought this leave in conditioner, and it wasn't any better than my $3.17 conditioner, actual that one works better. you have to use to much product to get a curl"
I bought this for my 4 year old grandson that loves transformers. He wasn't too thrilled with this one. Might have been a little advanced for his age. It is durable.
"I love this game! I've been playing Chess since I was eight years old, which is quite a long time, but I love this variation on the age-old game. It is a wonderful teaching tool, which I have used to teach several dozen children, some as young as six, to play. Every child has learned the basic movements in a single sitting of about 30-45 minutes, and most have moved on to the three-card or five-card variations very quickly. The truth is, though,that most seem to prefer this game to ""regular"" Chess!"
"I played this game with my 5-yr old son and he quickly caught on to the game. It helps if kids have a general knowledge of the game such as having played T-Ball or Little League. Baseball in general can be a complicated game, but this game does a decent job of teaching various aspects of the game, ie, balls & strikes, moving and scoring runners, and fielding outs.The game basically has two main components"
"Ah the controversial Swheat scoops litter! Does it breed bugs? Does it stick to the bottom of litter boxes? Do pets gorge themselves on it? You won't know until you try it in your home with your animals. However, know this... One of my cats love sleeping in it! Ok now that I have your attention, keep reading.From my own trial and error instead of reading the instructions, Swheat Scoops likes to be used with a deep layer of about five or six inches or so in a normal box. Otherwise, you get that odoriferous oatmeal cookie dough consistency stuck to the bottom of your litter box.The Litter Robot II doesn't work well with Swheat Scoops litter. Unlike a conventional litter box, you can't simply add more than the recommended litter to the Litter Robot II. If you add too much litter, the excess gets dumped into the waste receptacle. And there in lies the problem. Since the litter isn't deep enough, the cookie dough sticks to the flexible rubber bottom of the globe! The cookie dough sticks so well to the rubber, that when the rubber flops out when the globe is fully inverted, the cookie dough won't let go! That's sticky... and Stinky too.So folks with normal boxes, double up the depth and you'll be fine. People with Litter Robot II's, don't use it or you'll end up taking a litter scoop to your globe. Quite ironic since didn't you want to stop using a litter scoop when you got your Litter Robot II? Also, I noticed that my normal litter scooper didn't sift the excess swheat scoops too well. It felt like I was tossing out a lot of the good with the bad. So maybe a scoop upgrade is necessary too."
"For the first few years of our marriage, my husband and I had hand-me-down furniture and were pretty lax about letting the cats sharpen their claws on the couch. When we bought our first home and purchased new furniture, we didn't want them shredding it, but didn't want to put them through de-clawing surgery either. My friend recommended these and they have worked great!Our indoor cats are 2 and 5 and were really good about letting us apply these to their claws. (Tip"
"My daughter had a rare blood disorder that resulted in widespread scleraderma on her arm. This causes hardening of the tissues, skin problems, and loss of function in her hand. All in all, a nightmare for this young woman.She was introduced to this therapy by her hand and arm physical therapist. It helped her greatly, and they decided that daily therapy at home would be a huge benefit. We purchased this unit, which, for all intents and purposes, is the same as the professional unit used by her therapists.We have hope that systemic drug therapy will eventually reverse and even cure the scleraderma, but we think the wax treatments are essential to prevent further damage in the interim. If it can help someone like my daughter, then it should be a fine option for many people with less severe skin conditions."
Bio spot doesn't work. I bought it to try and save money. Guess you get what you pay for. Bought Frontline and it is excellent.
Let me set this straight
My husband and I bought Sing Me to Sleep Pooh before our son was born. This is all he needed in the crib to fall asleep. If he woke in the middle of night he would hit the pillow on pooh and when the first song was done he was fast asleep and so was I! He will be three next month and carries him everywhere pretty much. The babysitter has sown piglet back to pooh a million times. We are going to purchase another one for his birthday. The first one was loved to death and it shows. I have given this as baby shower gifts and all the mothers loved it too.
"I tried it several times right after I got out of the shower. I use the smaller end, and went slowly. It definitely had a good suction, and it felt good, but it did not clean my pores. My pores looked just as clogged after using it, and the vacuum hadn't collected any gunk.However, Amazon made it very easy to return. Shipping was free via USPS. All I needed was a printer for the return mail label. Trying it for yourself will only waste your time, not your money.(I wish Amazon let me give it zero stars.)"
"My cat likes to urinate in the front of the box. The litter is not very deep at this location, so it sticks to the bottom. The rake tries to get through it but struggles. I have to use the old method of scooping to losen the clumped urine mass and then the rake will continue its job. The downside is that it is automatic. If I am unable to loosen it because I am not home, the motor will continue to run and try to clean the box."
We received this as a family gift for Christmas. My 2 year old and 5 year old both love this game and my husband and I have fun playing it with them too! I highly recommend this because it is very educational and fun at the same time! Plus it helps the kids burn off some energy!
"A friend of ours had one of these and it worked great! It was so sensitive that you could stand across the room and move and the Musini would play. Ours does not work that way at all! Even with the sensitivity turned up to 10, ours still does not play unless you are so close you are practically touching it. The music sound is good when it does play. That is why I gave it 2 stars. It will probably go in our junk pile."
"The description of this game are somewhat vague and I didn't know what to expect. Well, it turns out this game is all about anagrams. This can be enjoyable if you are someone who enjoys word games. However, compared to standard trivia or family board games, it falls a little short for ""fun""."
"My french bulldog sleeps on this bed and prefers it to two other sleeping areas we have for him. The memory foam is firm and it looks pretty comfortable for my little guy. I only wish that the material on the top wasn't white, as it seems to get dingy very quickly. I would buy this again and suggest this item to friends."
"I bought this toy for my two-year-old son. He shares it with his one-year-old sister and it has been getting pretty steady use since we got it three months ago. They just love it!!! We have all of the cartridges, which my two-year-old changes by himself.I wouldn't recommend the Dora tape - it drives me nuts. They play the same repetitive song on EVERY page. All of the other cartridges (Barney, Elmo, Blue's Clues) are fine, though.Both of my kids are highly mobile and have been giving this thing a work-out! This toy has been dropped repeatedly, dragged by the microphone, had the cartridges put in and out a million times and it still works fine (quite frankly, I would be happy to see the microphone break). It has two volume settings that I would label as ""tolerable"" and ""ear-splitting"".I would highly recommend it!"
This is a gift for my son.. He lost his dinaco and we needed to replace it. He has all the cars toys and now this completes his collection!!
"Finally something that makes my dogs smell better! Other products just add a new scent on top of the stinky dog smell. I was looking for something that covered up the stink until I can bathe them. This does the trick and smells really nice! Anybody that says this is too strong does not have a big, stinky dog. Also, I have never had a dog that enjoyed anything I squirted on them -- if I wanted something that they liked, I'd buy a spray that smelled like something dead. I recommend you try this stuff instead."
Works really nicely but the heat guard red things on the sides sometimes catch my hair - so be careful!! Its wonderful that you don't mistakenly burn your hand but if you have fine/thin hair like me the guards might pull a hair strand or two.
"I am very happy with this product. I have two little girls, 4 and 7 they beg to take baths all the time so they can play, it hangs so strong onto my bathroom tile and is so very cute. The little animals are very detailed considering is it plastic and painted, they have holes in their mouths that you can spuirt when filled and holes in the bottom that drain- this is so great cause I have had the mildew build up inside old plastic toys before. The slide is my only concern because is hangs out a little, but even with my accidental braises nothing has pulled away or broken off. Another adorable feature is all the upper decks have a slotted floor- this allows the water to flow down like a waterfall. Truth is I enjoy watching the boat as much as they enjoy playing with it."
"I just used this blo-dryer at the JW Marriott in downtown LA and I LOVE it. I am buying one today. Normally I don't just find products and fall in love like this, but as I was doing my hair I realized I don't even have to use my straightener after to reduce the frizz that I usually get with my other blo-dryer. Great product. And such a bonus that it can be neatly put away."
"My cat is a total pig. I have had him on a diet for 3 years and he still manages to gain weight. Being an indoor cat and living in a small apartment, he doesn't get a lot of opportunity to run around. So, he cries and harasses me for hours before feeding time, scarfs his food, and then proceeds to cry for another hour or so. Automatic cat feeders had broken him of harassment, but he was still fat.The PetSafe SlimCat Food Distributor Ball is a godsend. Yes, he still tries to get me to feed him earlier than the scheduled times, but he will also cuddle with me if I start petting him. He loves to push the ball around the house (we have hardwood floors) and always acts really excited when food drops out of the ball. He'll even stop eating to go and check out a noise or see what we are up to. He is more playful than he used to be and seems really happy. He has stopped hissing when we pass by his food and has generally become a nicer cat.I would be happy with just his attitude change, but he has also lost weight! He has always been a large cat, but I was feeding him the recommended servings for a cat half his size and the diet foods didn't do any good. With the ball, I actually feed him more and he is trimmer and healthier.TLDR; cat is happier, thinner, and this makes me happy!"
I had clear skin most all the way through High School then suddenly when I turned 17 I had severe Acne...so severe Accutane barely worked. My dermatologist(one of the best in the nation) sells the whole MD Forte line. He suggested that not only I use some of the higher glycolic acid contet products but that my family members with conditions like rosacea. We all found it effective and not nearly as irritating as products like Retin A or harsh over the counter face wash. The face wash is detergent free so not at all drying and I found this particular product good for oily skin since it is a gel. Now that I am older and have much dryer skin I prefer the lotions and creams. I hope this is helpful because with all the very expensive(dior) type product lines out there this is what Dr's actually suggest.
"We tried the ""wired"" invisible fence at our previous home, but the dog discovered that if she ran fast enough, she could escape. Amazingly, this product works for her. It was much, much easier and less expensive to install, and she learned very quickly that she could not leave the yard. This product also eliminates problems that the ""wired"" invisible fence can have when erosion or children or animals digging expose the wires."
"I've been playing this game with my 8 year old son every night since we got it last week. It is really fun for him and I enjoy it as well. I especially like that he is learning his states, capitals and location of the states while he is having fun and he doesn't even realize it! Wish the four included maps had a plastic coating instead of just paper, but overall it is a great game, especially for the price."
"This is a great product that can literally stay warm all night. My indoor cats love it, but I found out about it from friends who do animal rescue and feral cat T&R. They use them while feral cats are being acclimated to a new location during the colder months; the cats are in a ""hutch"", or large cage, while they get used to their surroundings and are given these disks for warmth. Be careful to make sure you follow the directions, overheating the gel will cause the outer plastic casing to bubble up and then you'll have to throw it away. I only wish it was wider and flatter to be able to put under a blanket more easily- the disk is smaller than an animal so they're laying on a lump in the blanket. Still, my cats do not seem to mind and it's kind of funny to watch them all try to pile up on one disk while another is heating up."
"After using this dryer for only 3 months, the low heat setting no longer works. Sparks also flew from the bonnet the last time I used it. I have yet to hear from the distributor to get resolution."
"This is a GREAT puzzle toy! I have a dog that tends to destroy things (Hes a pit mix with a super strong jaw)... he chewed through the rope on the tug a jug within an hour. These squirrels provide more of a challenge and it just keeps me laughing seeing him throw the squirrel around the living room trying to get the treats out. Over time, the prongs do come off and I have gone through 3 of these due to the prongs coming off, making it too easy, but that is over the course of 6 years and he gets treats in it daily. Its the only puzzle toy ive been able to get him that has actually kept him busy and frusterated for hours! I highly recommend it. The large one is big enough to fit a little over 1 cup of kibble which is perfect for his breakfast and dinner. Great Toy!"
this videonow xp is the best toy ever I just got it yesterday and I love it so so much I don't even watch tv any more
Sure most of the parts fall off and get lost but so does every other toy and walker on the market. After the doors were removed (and lost) by my 10 month old son -he became interested in using it as a walker. This walker is wide and much better then the narrow handle bars on the fisher price. It's resistance is great for carpets and I never worry about him speeding off uncontrollably. He just loves using this walker and complains every time we take it away! I think it is a great stepping stone for his next milestone ....walking on his own!
"This is a fun game to play when you don't want to be on a set time schedule. You can pick up a quick game or play all night. The questions are fun and interesting and the timer helps you ""exercise"" your brain. Small and easy to take anywhere."
"My twins are about 9 months old now, they are B/G and I own this B.E (baby Einstein) and the UltraSaucer Castle One (I'll call it U.S.C) This one is more of their favorite, and I love it too!I purchased this saucer when I saw how much the twins loved the U.S.C that I got for my shower. I like that its not all music and electronics like the LeapFrog. My sister has a little girl whos one year old, the leapfrog is too small, but her daughter fits well in mine! It makes too much noise and there are no toys that actually are just rattles, too anoying and pricey. The B.E has a balanced mix...One of the other reviewers mentioned all the toys, but the little, what we call, ""game board"" makes music. It has a duck, lion, dog, cat, and a cow on it. They say the names and make the animal noise, but it also says the color on the button, educational and fun. The other electronic toy is the book. It sort of reads, makes music, and the twins like it... but thats all the electronics!Amazingly they really enjoy that green pupet, we see him in the ever so popular B.E videos, and we own an actual pupet of him! The other toys are great teethers and they are super fun to play with.The saucer spins easily, and my twins are now masters! I see my daughter just spining around, having the time of her life just spining! Its also funny to put the pegs up to it rocks, they love that! Its easy to adjust heights, and the twins have one more setting to go!! The seat is the perfect size and any toddler/baby could fit. I also put cheerios, fruits, whatever on the trays and the toys have never stoped working and the kids have a blast!I really love this B.E product, the U.S.C is nice, but its not as fun as the B.E!! I suggest to ALL new moms to purchase this toy, its just soo much fun!"
"This product is wonderful!!! I used it like everyone else and sat under the dryer until it was hard. Then rinsed it out and immediately felt the difference in my hair. Soft, shiny, silky, and much much stronger.What they don't tell you is two things:1) make sure you use the ApHogee Balancing Moisturizer immediately following this treatment because it is a very powerful product. The Balancing Moisturizer does just that--balances your hair; and2) don't use this treatment more frequently than every six weeks. That will most certainly cause this extremely powerful product to over-process and break off your hair.Don't believe me? Check out the results of another believer on www.youtube.com/ateyaaa.Trust me...buy and use the products together for the best results without any damage whatsoever."
This game is absolutely a blast. Our son loves it and it's easy for him and us to play and it teaches competition while still making things exciting. We all giggle over what rolls we get. If we get two sleeping cats we exclaim (CATEYES!) like rolling snake-eyes. We have so much fun and even though the box is almost half in pieces it is worth the purchase and a wonderful wonderful game!
"I aopted an 80 pound German Sheppard that had no training, she pulls constantly to the point of giving me blishter and she acts really goofy around other dogs. So I purchased the Gentle Lead, watched the DVD, (a must) and she has practically trained herslef, with very slight correction from me. I am very sensative to any pain for ahrm with my companion animals so therefore I was a bit concerned about this lead, but after using it I feel I can recommend it as a useful tool. YOU DO NOT NEED TO PULL HARD OR DO A SHARP JERK/TUG LIKE THE PREVIOUS PERSON MENTIONED. Now we go for walk and thee is no tugging or pulling. Give it a try and I hope you have the same success."
i have several of this type of dog crate. they fold up and are easy to carry and set back up anywhere. but the door on this one looks like it may have been welded wrong? it doesn't fit into the clips on the side panels the way it's supposed to.
"Bought for my 30 pound hound mix last summer for a 2,000 mile trip--pricey but worth it. It is great. I'm getting another one today (small) for my 16 pound terrier mix. Haul inside for night bedding. The little drawer is very handy for extra bags and treats. It was tight to get the cover off to wash but it did not shrink!"
Very light eye moisturizer in small compact dispensers good for travel. Minimal cream in each container
"I realize this has worked for others, but it hasn't made a difference in my Yorkie. She still gets upset on car rides. I spray her traveling bag every time a few minutes prior to leaving. I've been doing this nearly every time since receiving the spray and no change."
"My 6 1/2 year old daughter loves Leap Pad - but be aware that when you jump to the blue level, the entire pages are no longer read aloud (which was quite a disappointment to her). The pen will read the words 1 by 1, but not the whole page. The pages are fairly long and filled with text, yet the questions are almost too easy. Early readers may tire ofr reading independently. It would have been nice if the Leap Pad could have read the pages. There are limited activities compared to the orange (lower) level."
I was looking for Unscented Shampoo and Conditioner because of asthma and COPD But this stuff is quite the opposite and very strongly scented. Smells nice but strong. I understand its unscented garlic but the discription lead me to believe the products were totally unscented.Nutrine Garlic Conditioner Unscented 16 oz.Nutrine Garlic Shampoo Unscented 16 oz.
"I have a 3-year-old, 90-lb. German Shepherd, and he absolutely LOVES this toy! He usually rips every plush toy to shreds, but he somehow hasn't destroyed this toy. Although he figures out how to remove each squirrel from the tree within minutes, he spends hours squeaking each little squirrel, flinging the squirrels around the room, and chasing the squirrels. Then he brings the empty tree to me and puts it in my lap so I'll put the squirrels back inside of it. He tires himself out playing with this toy -- I'll find him passed out in his bed with little plush squirrels strewn all over the bed, and he lays his head on the tree. I'm going to get the Hide-A-Bee next."
Nice to have such a display to teach the Nativity scene to our young ones.... nice not to have to do it with the ceramic pieces my wife and I treasure.I have hopes that Fischer Price will do additional bible storie. If you like this setup you also might like the Little Peoples Noah's Ark.
"I bought this toy for my son when he was 6 months old. I felt a little guilty about the toy because my son had more toys than he knew what to do with, but I found it to be a great buy. It fits great on my Graco Breeze stroller and my son loves the toys, especially the snack cup.The only problem that I have encountered is now that he is 13 months he can undo the velcro snaps which face the inside of the tray, causing the toy to fall off. I tend to only use it every once in a while, but it is worth it for a happy baby at the doctors office or mall."
"Okay, so I got these steps after accidenatlly breaking my old ones. They are made of a very hard plastic and work very well. The wider steps allowed my Chihuahua to be able to climb up to my bed. The other steps that I had terrified my dog, but these are really great and give me piece of mind because I know that my dog will not be just jumping off my really tall bed. I do caution you that these stairs are hard to put together. The pegs go in fine but you do have to press really hard to get them in and the instructions are kind of hard to understand, but other then that they are really great. Oh, and my Winner Dog also uses the stairs and they work very well."
"My ex girlfriend bought me the 6.8 oz bottle for Christmas and it's not the real deal! The one thing I remembered about Curve is, it lasts for a really long time and you can still smell it even after you wash your clothes at times, but not with this product. It seems like the smell goes away as soon as I walk out the door. I was really disappointed, since this is my favorite cologne."
"My daughter's name is Stella Luna and we received this gift from my aunt. She got it because her granddaughter has it and loves it. She still falls asleep with it in the bed at 2 1/2. Stella loved looking at the reflections that were projected in a soft focus when she was in a crib and now loves to sit in the dark of her room with someone there to look at the front viewing window to identify moons, stars, clouds, etc. If you are willing to enjoy and point out beautiful aspects of the toy's moving art, you and your child will enjoy this."
"This product is great. The clean up is nothing compared to when cutting with regular clippers. Almost all the hair is sucked up by the vacuum and cleaning is reduced to wiping down the sink area. The motor could be a bit stronger, but it still cuts the hair without any pulling."
I purchased this item for my daughter whom is 2 months old. I wanted the voice activation which is wonderful. It is very sensative to this feature. The lights put on a beautiful display. I would highly reccomend this crib light to any one. My child is too young to play with all the bells and whistles but I am sure she will love it when she gets older.
"This game is a lot of fun for a couple of friends or for a lot of friends. It has been great for me and my wife because it was hard for me to find a card game, or any game my wife like to play.It is easy to learn.It take alot of thinking to win,.so it makes you use your brain to make you think what you and your partners are trying to do either to get a sequence or block the other players from doing the same. Just a lot of FUN just give it a try and you will get hooked on it and start a weekly or monthly get together with your friends."
Absolutely keeps fleas away. My cat does not like taking flea meds. Frontline affects him less than does other brands including Advantage. Just wish it were cheaper.
"I can no longer find Paul Sebastian in the department stores that used to carry it so I was happy to find it online at Amazon. The price was good, too and it was delivered to me so I didn't have to drive around to find it."
"We've used this litterbox for more than 3 years now. We have 2 cats that are quite competetive in their box activities. I agree with many of the reviews...the litter does clump at times and then the rake is unable to complete its sweep of the pan. We currently use Fresh Step (we've tried them all). I hose the litter pan and rake down every month or so and when its dry, I spray it with 2 coats of SILICONE SPRAY to decrease muddy litter patches. !!Spray anything that touches the litter!!I hate cleaning the litter box, but partial scooping every 1-2 days is better than daily changes, any day of the week. Enjoy! P.S. Have you seen the power booster cable advertised to give the rake a li'l ooomph?"
"Our 4.5 year old loves this.We take away all the toy guns, but the cannon is great! We line things up and try to knock them over with the cannon. Unlike most projectile toys in the house, nothing has been damaged!We have seen kids carry this set to swim meets, etc - portable entertainment!I love the modular aspect of Playmobil - every new set you get adds to the fun of previous sets. The pirates can visit the castle, the dump truck can visit the train, etc. Lots of creative play options!About the small parts - if you loose something, call Playmobil and they will send new if they have it. We got replacement oarlocks, and a replacement cannon (by mistake - we asked for the cannon balls!)"
"Great fun for cat lovers and anyone. Just like Monopoly, except cat breeds replace the properties, and cat ""goings-on"" replace the draw cards. Interesting cat facts on backs of the ""deed"" cards, too. MEEOWW!"
"great crate, waaay better quality than i was expecting. feels very sturdy and seems it will last a long time and the divider is a great plus. only downfall was the packaging was horrible, the box was torn and looked weathered. besides that i would give the actually product 5 stars. definitely would buy from this company again (:"
Ingredients
"This lotion is FABULOUS. It makes my skin so soft, I literally can see my hands are hydrated. The smell is very nice, not too flowery or fruity - a very nice blend with several different notes. The real bonus is how moisturizing it is. One application lasts a long time. Lotion is not oily or watery - goes on creamy and smooth. Highly recommend."
"This is a neat game, it's like Othello but for up to four players.My four year old and seven year old enjoyed playing this.I liked that the game lasted for more than five minutes (and it kept them entertained without much assistance from me for a little while).It will continue to be fun for them as they grow older and develop the ability to use more advanced strategy."
"I love this product it actually tight some what the skin BUT teh customer service is very poor, I wrote to them and ask if they have a program for customer that order in a consistence basis there products mayeb it will be a litle economical (shipping wise) and their response was liek I wa asking them fro them to give their product FREE sometingI did not expect eitehr ask for, to me tehy need to put somebody that have the skills to answer to customer porperly I wont order any of their product again sometimes a litle curtesy comes a long way I am going to order somewhere else may not be the same product but the quality better and their customer service better"
"I have read reviews from others saying this thing works. However, for my three small dogs it doesn't do much. I know they can hear something because when I push the button to emit the sound I can see them tilting their heads like they hear something. However, it doesn't stop them when they are barking. I am not even sure they can hear it when they are barking. I am wondering if one of the more expensive sound emitting devices would work better."
"My dog likes the toy, but it is small. The ""squeaker"" is kept inside by Velcro, and they come with an extra squeaker."
"Takes time to set up for short play duration. If you do not mind the set up time, the game is fun for the children."
first of all if you want to save space you should get it but if you really want to battle get a diffrent stadium it works for some but not for all.
"I bought this toy, and all I can say is wow! The droid rotates on it's stand untill it detects your lightsaber. It will give 2-3 beeps (depending on which level your on.) There are two levels. Once it picks up your saber, the droid WILL track you anywhere it goes. Once you are in a still position it will fire a tracer disk at you, almost at the speed of light. Deflect it! The game works bet if you make sure that the back of the lightsaber is always facin the droid and you are directly behind the lightsaber. Overall it is an awsome game!"
"Received the Ravenwing squad today and I'm excited to get painting and assembling the whole thing. I've been playing WH40K for years now, and this is my first foray into the Space Marines army, and I liked the back story for Dark Angels, so I started picking up a couple of sets here and there. Now this set will fulfill a portion of my fast attack contingent to a tee! NOTE"
"The toy is a favorite of one of my cats, the other likes a version that has elastic sewed in so it ""boings"" away from her. I highly recommend the toy but dont pay that much when you can find them at the dollar store."
"This product is amazing. It provides maximum coverage and lasts until I wash my hair again. This along with the hair fibers keeps me in tact. The application is messy, it takes time to apply, but once you're done you're good to go!"
"This toy is very disappointing. I'd like to see a 5 year old put this together and play with it. Its impossible. Nothing stays together. I will never buy another lego transformer for my son, he and both were so frustrated and now that we have it ""together"" he is even more frustrated because he can't play with it. The minute he touches it it falls apart. What a bummer."
The mini perfume was exactly as advertised and made a delightful stocking stuffer for my sister-in-law. Product arrived promptly and exactly as promised on the website.
I bought this toy when my daughter was 5 months old. The minute I put her to play with the drum she began banging on it. She is now 7 months and when I put her down to play with it now I find her singing ( more like babling) while she plays with it. I really think this is a great toy. I cant wait to see what else what else she does with this toy!
"People whose dogs have corn allergies should limit their purchases to the Vanilla Mint and the Wheatfree Veggie-Chicken flavors, which don't contain corn gluten. Without the corn gluten, I'd have given the Everlasting Treat 5 stars."
"I love this dye. Good color, last decently, doesn't hurt your hair. I always use manic panic on my hair and I ALWAYS get compliments"
Scent was too sweet and was not a fan....Sorry! Annick Goutal. You might want to try her Gardenia Passion instead.
"I wanted so much for this to work, but unfortunately it didn't decrease my little ones anxiety level. I have tried it multiple times, and even had friends come over, but he barks just as loud and jumps on people just as much as he did before. He does look really cute in it though which is why I gave in 1 star. I will be returning this product."
"I bought this cologne based on many many favorable reviews. I have over 20 major brand colognes and this is one of my favorites. It is ALMOST identical to Acqua DI Gio except it has kept in check the aspects of Di Gio I didn't care for. It is just a tad less sweet, perhaps by the addition of grapefruit to the top notes that gives it a more sophisticated distinction from DI Gio. There are no unpleasant tones to this cologne and it seems to last a while. The bottle is stylish and very tall compared to all of my other ones, but the box is pretty plain. It is not quite as casual as HUGO and would work well when you MUST make a good impression. It doesn't appear to be as overdone and popular as some others, so you can still mark your territory, perhaps because it's a bit pricey."
"And I say it as an expert on just about any product that promises to reduce pet hair shedding, or make the clean up of it easier.I have a Norwegian Elkhound, one very compact, highly intelligent, gorgeous and HAIRY dog. She has both a long coat and a very prolific downy white undercoat that seemingly sheds 24/7. It's got a cotton ball texture; tufts of it stick out, and if you pull it, you get a pouf of very soft white down that is guaranteed to stick to you and everything in its path.My former regimen was to use a rubber curry brush for the long outer coat, and (the part I hate), an undercoat rake. No matter how much I brush her, I'm covered with hair, and there's a grocery bag FULL of hair. It's an hour to two hour task, and as much as I love my dog, a huge, hairy nuisance!When I got the Furminator, I was impressed with the heft of it. I bought the large size with the idea that it'd be that much less effort (generally speaking, the small size is the cheapest, but it's so small, it would take forever on anything but the smallest or unhairiest dog. And the difference in price between the medium and large is, at most places, only a few bucks. If you're going to invest in the furminator, go for the size that makes the most out of every pass over the dog's coat.)So I tried a few swoops on the dog. And yeah, it resulted in a ton of hair, but if I just run my fingers through her coat, I get pretty much the same result.I got a grocery bag (to store the hair pulled off the comb) and set to work. On the initial combing, it took a little less than the usual hour it does. What was interesting, though, is that I used only the Furminator, not the undercoat rake and curry comb combo I usually use. In that sense, it was less time and effort.The bag, as usual, was full. But the thing that really sold me on the Furminator is how good her coat looked. Very professional looking, like she had just gotten back from the groomer's.Now it's a few days later, and lo and behold, one of the promises the maker of the Furminator made seems to actually be true"
"My polish chiped the same day! Much faster than if I had used no top coat at all. I even tried just this polish by itself and same thing- chipped and peeled within 12 hours. I tried filing & buffing, made sure I washed my hands to remove oils before polishing- nothing worked. It just chipped and peeled right off. This was a waste of money, only use now is to stop runs in pantyhoes. Do not waste your money. The Diamond Strength nail color works much better, usually lasts 7-10 days with no chipping and does not need a top coat."
"I was getting married and the lady that was supposed to do my hair and makeup backed out two weeks before my wedding. I liked the hairgami products that I have used in the past and needed one more piece to accomplish the look that I wanted. I was thrilled that I could get a kit with the piece that I needed and a few extras to play with later on. I have since watched the little dvd that came with it and tried out a few of the other looks, which take patience but look great once you figure them out. I liked this product and would recommend it to anyone that would like to move beyond scrunchies and ponytails everyday for work."
"Our 14-year-old domestic shorthair, always active and muscular, had been showing increasing signs of stiffness, discomfort, failing mobility, even depression over the past several months. Our vet suggested (not terribly enthusiastically) trying Prescription Diet JD or weekly injections to ease his apparent developing arthritis. He is on a CD diet to discourage the development of crystals blocking his urethra (he was hospitalized in a harrowing incident a few years ago, so we are loath to switch his food), would not put up with injections from us, and is almost pathologically resistant to leaving the house. I decided to try Synflex despite a strong skepticism that it would work for him. I've been happily proved to have made the right choice. While he's not tremendously fond of the taste, he will eat Synflex on his food. His appetite has returned, his mood has improved, his ability to jump has rebounded to an extent (he always makes it up onto the bed on the first try again, though he still takes the toilet lid route to the bathroom counter). His gait is much smoother, and he's taken to enjoying the rips again through the house, including several cat flaps. He can race down stairs again instead of bobbing slowly down one tread at a time. We noticed some improvement after just a few days of taking the supplement but tamped our hopes down to avoid the later disappointment of wishful thinking. After several weeks, however, we can enthusiastically report that this has made a *huge* difference in his quality of life. Thrilled!"
This product is waste of money for me. It didnot clean my pores as promised. It was not even able to remove my white heads.
My grandson loves this toy. He is one and loves walking around pushing this toy. one of his favorite toys at the moment.
Doesn't look special? The first time you use the hair comb on your pet you will be more than surprised. It removes most detatched hair that other groomers don't. Honestly you will be tickled pink. Great house-hold pet tool.
"This purchase arrived earlier than advertised and was in perfect shape. I have owned a number of these ""poopie scoopies"" and this one is by far the best quality. It even has metal dowels to hold the two sections together to protect the handle from plastic fatigue when ""twisting out a tough one"". My Springers and I make a game out of ""search for poopsicles"" and diposing of them in the trash. I highly recommend this product. Don't spend $25 - $30 for a similar item."
"Awesome Naruto bandana. Bandana looks great. However its made of synthetic (nylon, or rayon) materials. It's ok for fun wear, but not if you are going to work out or sweat in it. Cotton is better.Too bad metal plate is not removable for machine washing. Hand wash only, and then towel dry the metal plate so it wont rust.Hand wash it in Woolite, because of the metal band, and then dry the metal headband.Adult sized bandana."
"My face is very oily in some parts, and dry in other parts. This lotion keeps both in check, and prevents most of my acne breakouts that occur from broken oily skin."
"you CAN trust KONG~kong is a quality product~ they work~!! i love dog toys, but they wear out fast & i wanted to get ones that would last long! i got kong! yay!"
"This product leaves your hair soft and pliable unlike a gel. In addition it has a mild, sweet smell. The product adds no shine, holds the hair well and is easy to style. The hold lasts more than a few hours.I guess it is not for every type of hair out there. So, try it at your hairdresser's before ordering a pack of 2."
"I searched and searched amazon for a straightener that has a comb attachment for the side of the panels. My old straightener had this and it makes it work so much better! I specifically ordered this one because it has the comb attachment in the pictures and in the description, but when I received it in the mail, there was no attachment. What a waste."
"I bought this game to play with my boyfriend and his parents. After 2 and a half hours we gave up, citing the fact that none of us knew any of the answers to these extreemly obscure questions. The entertainment questions were ok. But we were stuck on the written word for about an hour."
"I bought this to create body for my thin, oriental-like hair (saw this as a tip somewhere), and I like it. In addition, it helps with oily hair at my temples. The smell of the Tropical version is not bad---just different. This is my first can of any brand of dry shampoo, and I'll buy 5 cans next time to cut down on shipping costs (maybe this will last me a year since I only use it once or twice a week). Also, I have not had any problems with the nozzle clogging, etc."
"I love this stuff! It makes my skin feel smoother and I swear it's evening out my skin tone. It has helped a lot with the circles under my eyes, both the puffiness and the discoloration. I had a little red spot right under my eye, a broken capillary, and NOTHING has ever helped it. But this stuff is making it fade. It's awesome!! I cannot say enough how much I love this product!!!"
"We left ours behind when we moved across the country -- wouldn't want to consider the alternative! I loved my pooper scooper and had used it for years. When we got here, I was looking hard for this in the local pet stores (I never thought to look on Amazon earlier). Thank goodness they still make this. It works great for grass, not so well for desert (rocked) backyards unless you want to lose half your rocks after a year or two. Well-designed, sturdy and lasts forever even if left outside to the elements."
I received the product promptly. I use it when my hair is wet or I wet the stick if my hair is dry. My sister has used this product for years and recommended it to me. It is a good product to use on the crown of your head when you need a quick touch up and don't have time to do a full root color. My colored hair is medium brown so I bought dark brown. My natural color is white.
"This stuff lasts forever! Bought a whole bunch of this Dora Playhouse furniture for her 3 years ago, and she still plays with it....and it still looks new...can't go wrong with this stuff. It doesn't have sharp edges, and it's not flimsy. Very sturdy and colorful..she loves her playhouse and furniture, and provides hours of fun for her and her cousins."
"My 3 year old son loves playing with these ducks in the tub. The only thing I have learned from previous toys like this is you need to take care of them or they will not last. When he is done playing with them, we clean the bottom of the duck off and tip them over so water does not get all into the pieces that make the duck work. We have had them since Christmas 2010 and 3 out of the four are going strong."
"My 4 year old loves Blue, but found this product complicated and cumbersome. The company needs to get a clue about young children. This was at about a 10 year old level. The idea is great but the execution was lacking. Overpriced and not as good as the oher Blue's Clues products that I have seen."
"It took us two tries to get the size right, but my big lab/golden mix loves her coat. She's not a long-haired dog and was really cold at night, but not now. This is keeping her much warmer AND it is very cute on her."
We thought the shipping was timely. The product is also amazing. We would recommend this company to anybody.
"We purchased this product based on the highly positive reviews we read here on Amazon. Our dog, Oscar, loves frozen Kongs, the Busy Body Squirrel, as well as the Bob-a-Lot and Kong Wobbler (basically anything that makes him work a little to get his food). However, he did not like this toy at all.We use the other toys to get him to slow down as he eats. Oscar is a 9-month old Laborador Retriever, and since he was about 4 months old he has scarfed his food down in seconds (only to become bored very quickly after). So very early we began to explore ways to make feeding time fun and a little challenging for him.We filled the Tricky Treat Ball with his food, just like the other treats, and put it on the floor and waited for him to seize upon the new toy (like he does with other treat systems). Instead he pushed it and then ignored it.The problem is that the food/treats do not reliably dispense-- it is basically a ball with a very long cylindrical piece attached to the entry (like a long tube that goes down into the ball). The dog really would have to turn this over and over and over to get treats to roll out. It has no weighting to it (like the Kong Wobbler or the Bob-a-Lot), so it just kind of randomly works. I think it makes it less of a 'puzzle' to figure out as the dispensing pattern is infrequent and random (and most often actions result in 'no treat' delivered).Hope this review helps. I do see a lot of dogs like this, so it may have to do with how your dog is used to 'working' for treats.Woof!"
"My kids (ages 4 and 5) really loved this game. I purchased it for them because I remember playing it as a child and thought they would enjoy it. Something inside of me feels good when I see my kids playing these &quot;classic&quot; games. The pieces are small and not recommended for very small children. My daughters had trouble successfully reaching the object of the games which is pulling the game pieces from the patient without setting off the buzzer, but they didn't experience frustration with this because the buzzer was hilarious to them! They would have set it off on purpose anyway!"
"When I bought Leapster I thought it would hold my children's interest off and on. I was wrong!! They LOVE this thing. I call it a learning system. They call it a toy. That's the thing. They play it like a toy and have a blast. I see that they are learning and I hear them giving the answers out loud. The constantly play it. I have 3 kids ages 5, 7 and 12. I know the age group is til age 8 but my 12 yr old likes to play with it for the paint feature. They absolutely have more fun playing with it than they do playing ANY video game or computer game-and believe me, we have them all from X-box to GB adv. SP and Leapster is the best!! HUGE screen keeps their interest as well. The animation is great. It has features like ""pause"" and ""home"" so that if they get tired of one game, they can start at the main screen without having to complete what they were doing. You will not be waisting you money if you buy this. A++++ all the way!!!"
This would have been the only lotion I bought for my kids if only I knew this when they were born. Their skin feels softer now ever since I started using it. The scent is great too!
"I do not have a very fussy dog. In fact, she will eat almost anything she finds outside, even though we feed her well. These dog biscuits made my dog very fussy. She refused to eat Meaty Bones and would go to the porch where we would store the Blue Dog Bakery Biscuits as if to say I want this one!These biscuits even smell great when you open the box."
Im buying it write now so ill beet ya to the Toys R Us .............................................................Geting out of the car.....................got it first .............Yippy!.......the first 8 year old TO GET IT IN BLACK AND WHITE!............ That is so sad you know!
"These are fantastic. I have been using them for several years, and I'm going to order two more ""just in case"" they would go out of stock. My toenails are so thick that none of the others--and I have tried several of various prices--will open wide enough to handle the nails. In addition, I have arthritis in my hands. If I do manage to get a nail within the clipper of all of the others I have tried, I cannot exert enough strength to trim the nail. Most others are also more narrow, which contributes still more to my problem.To repeat"
"We have two rescued indoor cats who enjoy playing with this cat toy. One of our cats scratches it to keep her claws off our furniture. We also take care of a feral cat who will step inside to play with the ball and scratch as well. So, three cats love it and have melded their accolades."
"I purchased this cologne (perfume) directly from amazon, it didn't came in the box as the pictures shows; if you're buying it as a gift it may not work for you; it comes in a clear plastic package, those that have the hole on top to hang them from the diplay. But it is the real thing and I love the smell and my friends love it too, for $14.00 I shouldn't be asking for more. if you really need the box (the box isn't really a big deal) you can pay the $17 from the other seller plus shipping. Not worth just for a box. Enjoy."
"Every toddler should have this classic shape sorter. Unlike heavier wooden shape-sorting cubes, it's light but sturdy, and its round shape encourages the child to spin it around to locate the various openings. The two handles are pulled to release the pieces and also are handy for carrying the ball around.Younger toddlers (15 months- 2 years) will need help with opening the ball and finding the correct openings, but they will quickly learn to associate the shapes with the correct openings. They will gradually learn to locate the openings by themselves and can learn the name of each shape.The Shape-O has some very easy shapes (circle, triangle) and also some trickier ones (pentagon, hexagon)."
Good Classic Kong at a fraction of the price they are charging in pet shops. Really happy with the purchase
"Makes combing your hair easy!Before buying my Ace Pocket Comb (hereafter, APC) I carefully weighed its pros and cons:Pros -- It combs my hair.Cons -- None, so far as I can see.So far so good"
"I am not the reviewer type. However, I feel the need to warn people about this because we are dealing with protecting our pets. I have a 10 week old Australian Shepherd. She is 11 lbs. When I received this thing, it seemed ok and solid. Once I Put it together, it was a different story. First of all, the way each side snaps into place is horrible. The design is so flawed, I am surprised the company is still in business. If I put a little pressure on the top of the cage, you can feel that it is ready to collapse. I figured that I would try it out anyway. BIG MISTAKE! I left my 11 lb puppy alone for 1 hour today. When I came back, she managed to not only get out but also bend some of the bars! How can a little puppy do that? Who knows what could she could have done had I been a little longer. Puppies need to be protected from themselves at that age. If you want to protect your pet, get something with a solid build that feels secure. This thing feels like plastic junk with metal coating. Save your money and go to a store so you can see what you are getting. This thing is going right back to amazon and I am suggesting they stop selling this product. Precision Pet should be shut down and ashamed they make such garbage."
"THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL. AS EXPLAINED IN THE MANUAL, YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT THE 2 SENSOR COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE SKIN OF THE ANIMAL. I TRIED IT ON MYSELF ( I HELD THE DEVICE AGAINST MY VOCAL CORD AND I GROWLED) AND I FOUND THE SHOCK TO BE NO BIG DEAL. MY DOG ALSO FOUND IT TO BE NO BIG DEAL, HE WAS MORE STARTLED THAN HURT."
"My daughter just turned 5 and is already on level 3 of all but math. She's an early bloomer with academics, but still, for a 6 year old this might be okay for the first couple of mos of 1st grade and then it would be too easy. I wish it was more challenging for her, and covered more subjects like science facts and basic geography. I guess we'll be investing in 2nd Grade sooner than I thought."
"Once you get it fed into the dispenser top, it is very easy to use. They feel refreshing and sometimes I find myself just wanting the cool feeling they provide. I won't be able to verify how well they work until I have had them for a month or two. But so far I like them."
Works great to turn my gray into copper color. Lasts about a month before the roots start growing out. The process is very messy though.
"I just luv, luv, luv this ""Ouchless"" brush! It feels so good on my scalp! Three came with the order. I also have scalp massagers that I use on the regular. But this brush not only does not snag or pull your hair out, but it invigorates your whole scalp! You honestly feel good and de-stressed after using this brush. I would definitely recommend it. Just my opinion."
"I pair the conditioner withBumble and Bumble Gentle Shampoo, 8-Ounce Bottle. Taken as a pair, I have three things to say:- I love how this product smells. It invigorates me.- I have never received this many compliments on my hair on a regular basis.- It has saved my very processed hair--instead of dry and breaking, my hair is soft and silky!"
"Treated the area twice, but no change - cat spray on carpet.Will not buy again nor will not recommend.Very disappointed."
"I've had two littermaids over the past 6+ years. First one my ex took with her but it managed to keep up with 3 cats for the longest time. Second one I bought used a year ago for my maltese dog and I've been very happy with it. I see a lot of complaints about them on here but I've never had a problem, I recommend them to my friends and family."
- Item described as new came in without the seal wrap. Item appeared to be used and smells as if it was very very old.
"great scent, never get sick of it. I do wish the scent lasted longer however, seems to wear off me rather quickly"
"I had a sample in a Men Mag, and really like the smell So i look it up and purhased a bottle. Would recomend, Not a strong oder mild and pleasing"
"I've only been using this product for a few weeks so it's hard to know if the joint supplement part is working well yet. However, my dogs seem to love it and they tolerate it well. The Digest All Plus in this product seems to work well. I will continue to use this product!"
"It keeps them stimulated and encourages them to learn, and their parents prefer a toy that educates them as well as stimulates their imaginations. The only complaint we have is where can one possibly find an adapter for one? We have searched many different stores and web sites that sell the leapster, but to no avail. Other than the lack of an adapter,the leapster lives up to our expections."
My 6 yr old son loves Bumblebee (of course). He has been begging for a Bumblebee transformer and the stores and online stores have been sold out. I saw this for $24.99 and read the reviews and thought it would be a great buy. Wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews. This toy is about $6. at Walmart. I thought it was a bigger version since it cost so much. I am so disappointed. Definitely will not let anybody know how much I was taken for on this Santa item.
"I purchased one of these back in 06/2007 and was ecstatic about it and so was my little girls and they still are. It is still going strong with few problems except that the material that it's made with is cheap not to mention plastic. I remedied most of the problems that others had mentioned in their reviews. The product is truly phenomenal in its design. I contacted the company who make these items back in 2007 with an excellent idea as to how they could make millions if only they would construct them out of ""Stainless Steele""! Following is an insert from the email that I sent to them, and they decided to ignore, ""Their Bad"".""Overall I love the product because my pets just love the continuous flow of fresh water, too bad you don't have it in Stainless Steel. Many people won't give their pets anything to eat or drink out of plastic containers. I was really hesitant myself because I don't usually give food or water out of plastic because it isn't good for animals. Foods have acids and other ingredients in it that interact with plastic and hard water, which I have, also reacts with the plastic. The minerals in the hard water corrodes the plastic and wear it out in certain areas. If you made this product out of Stainless Steel you would most likely have twice the customers you have now using it! This is ""FYI"" on what true Pet Lovers buy for their Pets. I only use ceramics or Stainless Steel containers to feed my Pets in. Not only does Stainless Steel last longer but it doesn't interact with food or water.""I have just recently discovered on Amazon.com that they sell another brand from a different manufacturerPioneer Fountain Big Max- Stainless Steelthat's made out of ""Stainless Steele"", but it's design isn't anywhere close to the design of the Auto-Pet Waterer (because it doesn't have a reservoir)from(Ergosys), old name, now the name is different with a slightly different design but they're the same right down to the plastic construction! Plastic isn't good for your pets food or water. Plastic is hard to sanitize properly. I've always fed my Poms' out of Stainless Steele Bowls. I ordered my new bowls(2) on 06/30/2011 and was supposed to have received them yesterday by FedEx according to FedExs' delivery reporting them as being delivered, but obviously FedEx delivered them to the wrong address and I'll have to wait until after the 4th of July before I get them! I was very disappointed because I wanted to introduce my cats and poms to them on the 4th of July. If only Pioneer Pets would make one similar to this plastic one by Ergo with the reservoir, they would make $millions. As stated earlier the plastic model cost too much to be made out of plastic. I can't review the new bowls from Pioneer Pets because I haven't had a chance to use them yet, but when I've had the chance I'll do a follow-up."
"This dragon looks like eastern dragons, with its face, whiskers and long body. It's wings were surprisingly easy to attach (considering past experience with other macfarlane's dragons). I thought it would be difficult to make it stand because it has only one leg on the ground, but surprisingly, there was no problem to it. Colors are beautiful.. this is my one of my favourite macfarlane."
"had high ratings although i have not used it yet i did open it to smell it and has a very potent scent, will definitely dilute it before i try it. but was delivered really fast."
"The LeapFrog Discovery Ball is a must have toy! My son was given this toy at 5 months old. He plays with it constantly, spinning the ball around and around while the music and alphabet song plays. The greatest feature is that it grows with your child's developmental stages. Now that my son is crawling I remove the ball from the base and he rolls it around while crawling after it. It has several different settings including a volume control. It plays music and the alphabet song while it spins with flashing lights. You can set it to either play 27 different nursery ryme tunes, letter sounds or the letter name when your child presses the letters. It's very durable and easy to wipe down. I highly reccomend this toy!!"
The Booda is wonderful to use with curious dogs. I love the hood to keep the dogs away.
This is not at all the perfume it once was. I finally found the original smell in the department store - Organza Indecence. Givency should make it clear to the customer that they messed with the product.
"This is a great game of kingdom building that is easy to learn and very fun to play. The games are relatively short (30 to 45 minutes)so it doesn't take an entire evening, either.Players take turns drawing land tiles and placing them on the board. Tiles have various structures (e.g. roads, cities, fields) on them that need to be matched up for proper placement. You can't have a road end in an open field, it must be attached to another road.Each player has a number of followers to dispatch throughout the kingdom. They can be placed on roads (to become thieves), cities (to become knights), monistaries (to become monks), or fields (to become farmers). Once a structure is completed (roads have two ending points or intersections, cities are completely walled in, etc.) the player scores points for his follower and may remove to follower from the board to place him on a subsequent round.This game is a good way to learn resource management. If you place all of your followers you won't have any in reserve for a prime opportunity, should it arise later. Is it better to get quick points with roads or small cities, or try to keep extending the roads and cities for greater scores? There are many strategies to consider and options to contemplate. Yet, this game is easy to learn in a few minutes. And since the players place the board pieces there are no two game boards alike.My friends and I have had hours of entertainment from this game. I highly recommend it!"
"This was actually a gift for someone, but I believe my friend's child is really enjoying it!"
"This hair clippers is smooth and easy to use and maintain. It's cordless and that makes it easy to cut those hard to reach spots. I use the cord when cutting the front and sides and go cordless when cutting the back because the battery dies after 20 minutes or so. Otherwise, they work great!"
"I purchased this item last year and was less than impressed with its quality and functionality. It was too small for my elongated toilet and not quite large enough for my round toilet either. Further, it is less than sanitary since it is partially sumberged in the bowl and thus sprayed with emissions. The stool is too bulky to be used reasonably and scratched my walls. In sum, it is of poor quality.I just purchased and highly recommend the Pottypal which can be used to the age of seven to lessen the size if the bowl and eliminate the fear of fallin in. I fould mine for $18.95 on ebay! You can see it's usefulness on pottypal.com"
A very rich and creamy moisturizer with a tropical scent. Excellent on super dry skin.
"Don't waste your money. The material is thin and cheap, and I'd have to say a kid in a Junior High home economics class would need to do better making something like this or be faced with a very disappointing grade. The product description unfortunately isn't lying, only because these are obviously the only covers produced for the Cool Bed 3."
"They keep my dogs busy and happy for awhile, and they even like chewing on the bones after the rawhide is gone. I have not had a problem fitting the strips into the slats even after extensive chewing. My dogs are large, aggressive chewers and the bones have held up well."
"The furminator works great at removing the fine undercoat, and small to medium clumps. I bought this product to use on my long haired cat in hopes I would not have to sedate and shave him again. He's never liked to be brushed, but puts up with this much longer than any other brush. No more sedation and shaving! It also works well on my short haired cat. It's such a wonderful product, I bought one for my mother to use on her cats."
Love this product. I have had now problem with the charger at all. Just press down to charge like the instructions say and it works. Saves a lot of money on batteries.
This stuff is the worst smelling conditioner I ever encountered. The perfume penetrated my hair and has not been able to get removed. It took 2 days before the scent calmed down enough that it was not bothering me with its obnoxiousness. I wish I could give it a negative rating. I am glad all I used was a sample and did not pay money to make my hair stink.
"The blocks are pretty good although the smaller sized blocks will not stay on the larger sized blocks as well as they should. The bag is junk, way too small for putting all the blocks in and the zipper broke immediately. for the price the quality should be alot better."
"This game is great! At first the kids were a little hesitant that it could actually be fun. Once we started playing, they all got into the exploration adventure zone. There are so many pieces, I think we can last a long time before ordering another set. But its nice to know there is an expansion set available. The hand opening could be a little bigger for ""father-size"" hands though"
"I can't say enough about this product! We LOVED this mobile, and although we never used the remote, it was nice to know it was an option (I didn't bother putting batteries in it). From 5 wks., we noticed our daughter respond when the mobile was put on. For many months, our daughter loved, smiled at, and followed the zoo figures. She even tried to reach for them. We took it down when she was 5 months. Now, we're getting a replacement since the other broke when accidentally crushed in the closet. This was by far the best baby toy/product we had for the first few months. Enough time to keep her entertained while I showered :)."

"Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot is a card game developed by Jeffrey Neil Bellinger and published by Playroom Entertainment. Some praise the game for its smart mechanics while others criticize the randomness. Differing opinions aside, Killer Bunnies is the game that got me into gaming. A few years ago I'd be happy to challenge you to a round of Apples to Apples or Imaginiff. Now I'm ready to team up and save the world in Pandemic.Killer Bunnies is more complicated than your typical card game. But I've taught over 20 people and everyone's picked it up within a few rounds. The instructions are written extremely well, but I can understand someone getting overwhelmed on a first read (particularly because I was one of those people).There are 12 Carrot Cards in the game. The main objective is to collect them. Once the last Carrot Card is drawn, the game is over, and one of those carrots is randomly selected as the winner. The more carrots you have, the higher your chances are of being the winner. This is a primary complaint that some people have with the game. ""In the end, the game is just a lottery."" To that I say:Yep.But strategy is also important. The secondary objective is to have as many bunnies out on the table as possible while simultaneously killing your opponents' bunnies. If the final Carrot Card is drawn and you have no bunny, all your carrots are forfeited and you have no chance of winning. Without strategy early on, you can't enter the lottery.Because of this, Killer Bunnies is a great example of harmony between chance and strategy. Everyone competes until the very end, as opposed to other games in which a single player dominates and no one has a chance to take them down. As long as you have a one bunny and a one carrot, you can win.The game allows for trading, which leads to additional layers of strategy (read"
My husband and our yellow lab have bonded through this frisbee! I have purchased many other ones that don't work even half way as good as this one. This frisbeen is soft and easy to throw. Our yellow lab is 7 years told but this frisbee is the perfect size and material for him. This is probably our 4th KONG frisbee!
"I love this one! And my dog loves chasing it when thrown like a frisbee. Seems very durable, although I have not left her alone to chew it. We use it for fetch at the park."
"My girlfriend acutally introduced me to curve. She really likes it, so i picked up a bottle...and i love it too! wish i had found this a while back! everyone comments about it...smells so good! you can't go wrong with curve!"
"My 3 month old cockapoo loved this toy. However, after just 2 days of light use, he chewed off both tips of the fish's tail. I can only assume he swallowed them. I just hope the pieces were small enough to pass though his system without any damage. I don't understand why toys made specifically for chewing are not made to be more durable. I would never give a child a toy that had pieces that might break off and be swallowed, and now I'll surely pay more attention when choosing my puppy's toys as well."
"This board game allows you to play football bingo with any football game. It comes with pre-printed cards, a ref hat, a silly yellow flag, and one pen.[...]"
"My old ""purple"" system died after 15 years of use. I was excited to try out the ""new, no salt"" system. I ordered it in January, and the system has already quit working. I'm having to find alternative ways to curl my hair and am not happy. I'm also not willing to fork out another $35 on something that may/may not work."
This was recommended to me for dry & shedding hair. I find it to be very lightweight while providing days of moisture. Especially in the winter. My daughter has very dry scalp and wanted a product that didn't weigh her hair down. If you're looking for a great moisturizer and style retention this product does the job beautifully. Your hair will have great body and shine without the oily look. Well worth the price paid. A Great value.
"My little boy was very disappointed, he was expecting what we ordered. which was the jeep with the trailer. What we received was the Four Wheeler with the trailer, it also doesn't talk.I had to spend extra money on shipping it back! I'm pissed!"
"I tried this product and only left it on for 2 minutes, but then it started to burn. After removing the product, my skin was really red. In addition, I am dark skinned so to have visible redness is pretty bad. I can't do anything with my skin excpet apply coco butter on it to help, but it hurts even when I wash my face.My skin is prone to acne and using this product has made it worst. I use Differin and I can't use it when my skin is like this, not to mention, using coco butter is not helping my pores but it is the only thing I can find that helps."
This brush is really comfortable. One star off because the fine bristles are not natural boar bristles but a synthetic material (boar and nylon blend). It is not as effective as a natural boar brush in distributing the oils in the hair. Overall a great brush.
"Sulfate free shampoos sometimes don't clean very well. This one is better than most. Also, it gets rid of any flakies."
"Fooled into thinking this is the best product around.the product was intentionally designed with a flaw to destroy the moter and force one to buy a new one. (why else would the company sell the motors and offer them as soon as the item was produced). Any intelligent engineer would have designed the product to have the filter BEFORE the motor, insuring the motor stays clean as well as the output water. we have to clean out the moter every 6-8 weeks so that it doesn't burn out from being clogged from dust and cat hair. I hope they redesign it and when they do, I will then write another review."
"My son has loved this toy and continues to play with it all the time. This was by far the best baby gift we received. From a very early age, he loved to listen to the music, play the piano, flip open and close the drawer, etc. He also learned to pull up and stand with help from the table once we added the legs. And can you guess what his first few words were? &quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;Bye Bye&quot; and &quot;Open.&quot; A great, activity table that your child will adore and get countless hours of play from."
"if you are thinking of buying a yugioh deck, this is the one!!it has great stratagies and rare cards (toon world, blue eyes toon dragon and the praticlly unbeattable relinqulished!!)OUT OF ALL DECKS OF YUGIOH THIS ONE BEETS THEM ALL!!TRUST ME YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED. Hope this review was helpful>_________&lt;"
My toddler son has really dry but hyper-sensitive skin and this has been a great help for him. It's the only lotion we've tried that doesn't irritate.
This is a very nice product to hide a litterbox or to use as a spot to put a bed & / or the cat's food dish. I have 2 dogs & my one dog would always eat the cat's food. I couldn't fit this in my downstairs half bath so I decided to put it in my kitchen & put the cat's food dish & a bed for her in there instead. Now my dog cannot eat the cat's food anymore. It looks very nice. It's sturdy. Was very easy to put together. I love it. Great product.
"First of all let me say that I have seen worse.This castle is about the quality of any of the mattel Barbie houses.We all know that when something needs to be assembled and pieces popped into place that sooner or later they will come off and have to be snapped back on,that's just the way it is.Secondly and most importantly(judging from most other reviews)the dreaded stickers.Yes there are quiet a few,however there are only 3 shapes-heart,star and circle.The good news about them is that they are made of the thicker silver holagram type material,so if a corner accidently sticks before you have centered it perfectly you can lift it back up w/out tearing the sticker.They are small and it is time consumeing(took me about 35 minutes) but there is a guide and the stickers are grouped into numbered cattagories.Assembly is also pretty basic and only took a few minutes.As for the hot air balloon, come on now.How many beach balls have you ever inflated that stayed inflated forever?That one is a given.I will say that the crown that comes with it is just plain crap!It is made of a rubbery sort of plastic and does not stay together well at all,but it really does not detract or add to the castle one way or the other.The turrets(balconies for balloon and crown) to me seem allright.They each have grooved sides that easily slide into place.I just love the music that is activated w/a pony.It plays the old MLP theme song.Some of the things that could have been better are the elevator(You just move it up and down w/your hand it could have had a handle or something to turn for movement),I also do not like the design of the spinnig dance wheel.All it is is a piece of round plastic w/a magnet to hold the pony on.It fits into a hole on the stage and you also just turn this w/your hand.Also when you place it on the stage it covers up the magnet that activates the music and lights.It would have been nice if it turned with the music.A carrying handle also would have been nice but over all I am not as disappointed as I thought I might be and for the sale price of 19.99 I think it is worth it."
"I have had this straightener for 2 years now. Before this I had the same product for another two years (which my mom now has and uses daily). It is a very dependable and sturdy straightener. I have long curly hair and my hair always comes out straight and silky after use. I have had previous straighters that costed more than $200 and they didn't do any justice. One of the best reasons I think this one lasts the longest is because the wire that comes out swivels. Many straighteners do not last long bc the wire gets bent and comes loose when you bend it. Since this one swivels the wire never has to bend. If you are looking for a cheaper great product, this is it!"
"I ordered this as well asBull Frog Sunblock, Surfer Formula Gel, SPF 36 5 fl oz (147 ml). Besides a better price point, I've found this product wanting in comparison. With the mist spray, I feel like it's much harder to get even coverage than with the gel. The texture isn't just as nice either, and despite actually using both with the same frequency, I've found that I need to use much more of this to feel like I get even coverage. I'd highly recommend the Bull Frog Sunblock instead."
Usage notes
Having trouble keeping your pet hydrated? This product will put an end to that. I puchased this for my daughters cat and he thought is was the best thing since sliced bread. Works well and dependable! You won't be wasting your money here.
"Wow, this hair straightener is amazing! I was thrift store shopping one day last year and came across it. It looked pretty expensive so I searched it on my phone and turns out it was selling for $75-$125. (I got it for $10 by the way!!!) So I went to try it out and my hair straightens PERFECTLY without getting frizzy! I have really curly hair so I always have problems with straighteners but this one is different and is well worth the price! When this one finally goes bad I will definitely be buying this exact one again! If you are sick of spending your money on cheap hair straighteners that don't work....buy this one!!!!"
Thia product was a huge disapointment. it smells nothing like Aqau Di Gio. i am very disaponted w/ my purchase. it smells like a cheap knock off. smells more like old spice. i was no happy at all. i e-mailed the place i purchased it from telling them i didnt think they sent me the correct cologne. the labels were right but it smelled nothing like it was suppose to and i rec'd no response. i will never purchase from this retailer again. it was a total waste of money. not at all what i paid for. it is suppose to be the real thing and sooo was not..
I got a replacement due to only 5 mins operation on battery. 2nd one had same problem. Remington gave a free alternate model and didn't ask me to return the old one. I let it sit for some months. Then I charged it and it started working! Go figure. No problems since. There must be some sort of fluke where the battery won't charge initially since many people have had this problem.
"EWWW EWWW GET IT OFF GET IT OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!OMIGOD I loved Hugo so much I've been anticipating this in the mail and bought the shower gel from a different source as well.This is just terrible. I'm taking a shower. Look for my posting of this CHEAP...I've already taken a loss.I have reviewed many colognes, take a look at them. I like most of them!"
"I have to admit, I wasn't too thrilled when I first looked at this one. &quot;Great, another silly space-war game&quot; I thought. But once we started playing, my opinion changed. The original Risk is a classic, but even the old favorites can get a little stale after a while. This 23rd century version is still the classic &quot;conquer the world&quot; game, but with enough new twists to make it seem like a whole new game. The most obvious difference is the new look of the game board. Continents have shifted around a bit, all the territory names have been updated (oh, how I miss Kamchatka in the springtime...), and there are now underwater territories. There's also a second smaller gameboard representing Moon-based territories. The Roman numeral unit makers are now MODs, little robotic looking battle drones of varying sizes. As for the gameplay, its the same basic deploy and attack, but now there are also special command units to work with. For example, you need to buy a Naval Commander if you want to attack underwater, and you can't get to the Moon without both a Space commander and a space station. Lose either of those, and your lunar troops are cut off until you replace them. You also accumulate power points, which you can redeem for Commanders, stations, special-function cards or to buy a specific place in the turn order. The cards are the best new feature of the game, adding alot of variety to the gameplay, and setting the stage for amazing shifts in the direction of the game. Say your opponant has Asia locked up, and you're really tired of him getting those extra 7 units each turn. If you've purchsed the Nuke Commander, you can use your power units to buy Nuke cards. Draw the right one, and you can nuke the whole continent, removing one of his units from *every territory*!. Careful, though. Nuke the wrong continent (determined by a die roll when you play the card) and you could nuke yourself! (Ask Ray, he knows!) Another nice touch is the status board, a grid numbered 1 to 70. Each player puts a unit on the board, in the box showing the number of territories owned. As battles are resolved, the winner's marker moves up and the loser's moves down, making it very easy to keep track of territory counts. &quot;Risk 2210 A.D.&quot; has enough new features to draw a whole new set of fans, but is enough like the classic to satisfy the old-timers. Overall, a worthy successor to an all-time classic."
"I would say that these are perhaps even better for small dogs than you'd think, because they're so huge that they can't be swallowed. The only problem is if your pup tries to eat the whole thing in one sitting, it may cause a bit of intestinal grumbling.My Jack Russell Terror loves them, and she NEVER chews anything, so that's quite an accomplishment. It keeps her busy, does a number on her teeth, and is just generally a great time-waster all around. They are a bit smelly but as long as I give her an appropriate surface to chew on (ex. a towel on the floor), she doesn't try to bring them up on the furniture.My only real complaint is that there are a LOT of tiny pieces left in the bottom of the bag, which aren't so useful because I have to supervise my dog pretty closely when she eats these."
I gave my father-in-law a couple ideas for my son's (1 year old) Christmas gift and this was one of the items. Boy do I regret giving him this as an idea. It is a cheaply constructed toy. The bus's hood doesn't even work correctly. The toy does not do much of interest and it constantly makes this annoying noise! The toy held my son's attention for less than 5 minutes. My suggestion to anyone considering this toy is there are many more worthwhile toys on the market- skip this one!
"This toy is without a doubt, the best toy my Ragdoll has. He plays with it every day, even in the middle of the night. I'm so glad to have read the reviews of others who convinced me to purchase this toy. I've debated whether to purchase another one for a different area of my house!"
"I just bought this brand of dog food for the first time because I was trying to find a cost effective quality food for my dogs. Not a week after it arrived, I hear on the radio that they have had to recall because people not pets were getting salmonella poisoning from handling the food. Thankfully my wife and I were able to avoid that unnecessary risk to our health!!! Now I had to waste my precious time to get the food out of my house and fill out their recall paperwork. Fail."
"My little granddaughter just received this yesterday. With dad chasing her with it and making funny giraffe noises (or what he thinks are giraffe noises), she quickly became friends with her new tall friend. I established a 'giraffe bond' with her when she was born, and this Melissa and Doug Giraffe Plush was perfect for this years present. While I wouldn't recommend allowing children to climb on it, having a helping hand from a parent to pose for a one-time sitting can help introduce the child to their new friend. The giraffe itself is cute and tall enough to give young children a tiny perspective on animal heights in comparison to themselves."
"I have a mature lab and a standard poodle pup. Both of them really enjoy their cubes, bouncing them all over the place and chasing after the food treats. It keeps them interested and happy."
This product is ok. I worry about the poisonous effects of citronella on my dog and by now she knows how to get the collar off anyway. Best used in small doses.
"The item received absolutely DOES NOT look like the item ordered; furthermore, when I contacted the seller they were bold enough to:1. Say that I was confused2. They said that they do not offer photos for every product they carry!!???Please read their response below:section from one letter--""Unfortunately we do not offer photos for every product we carry and that is why the typed product description is right next to the photo and again in the shopping cart to allow the consumer the opportunit to review their order before they finalize it."" ????They did say that they will refund me."
I've been using this for almost two years now. My dog loves to to be outside rolling on grass ect. Basically she does anything that makes he vulnerable to fleas. This product makes me feel that my doggy is safe ^.^ I highly recommend any pet owner to use this product
I am hearing that this is not the right beyblade and I read one of the reviews and it said that this is not driger s its spark night. I don't know which is which because i didnt get mine yet. When I get it and its not the right one I bought i want to know. Also if amazon.com is reading this and I dont get the right one its not my fault. If the title says driger s it should be driger s. I'm going to be really disappointed if this is not the right one.P.S I gave it all five stars if its the driger s.
"I received this as a baby shower gift and attached it to my son's carrier/carseat when he was about 1 month old and it has not come off since! He is not almost 6 months and still loves it. It does tend to get in the way a little when I am putting him in his seat or taking him out, but with I am okay with that because it keeps him so happy. When he was about 6 weeks old he decided that he hated his carseat. That's when I put this on it and ever since he has loved it. He used to love the music (because he was too little to do much with the toys). But now he will spend forever playing with the little fish and star sliding them back and forth. We still play the music occasionally when he gets fussy.I love this and would reccomend it to everyone. In fact, three other new moms I know with babies under 6 months of age have gone and purchased this after seeing how much my son loves it!"
"This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."
I think Helio Breacker is cool except I don't like the point when his Helio horns fall off and he should have had more power.
"In 15 to 20 minutes I can play a game with one of the kids and enjoy every minute. This game has an unusually simple, two part strategy, that ends up being fun. It's just perfect for those times when you don't feel you have the time or energy to break out Carcassonne and play for an hour or two with it's many expansions. We have come to really enjoy the game. You will too."
"My hair is thick, but fine. So, getting enough lift in the front is always an issue with me. If I don't use this product after shampooing my hair goes completely flat in about an hour. This is the best product I've found over the years. It isn't sticky or gummy or drying. You just spray it on the roots where you want lift. One bottle lasts a long time, too.Karen"
"My dog loves to chew and play tug. I bought this so I could play tug and when I got tired, he could chew on it. It took him a few minutes of chewing to go through a ring. The other two followed later in the day. Definitely not for chewers and not invincible."
I have tried many soaps in my time to deal with acne and skin issues on my face. They all left residue or over dried my face usually just making things worse. I been using alpha hydroxy for just over a week and have seen great improvement. I have normal to oily skin due to my working environment as a chef. I have to say this removes the nasty mess after work while leaving my skin in good condition. Great Product!
"thank you for this good product. I have not opened yet (still had some left), so can not fully comment but it is in same container with same labels. than you"
I have a sheltie with a thick undercoat. The furminator does wonders for removing the undercoat.
"I bought this for my son when he was just learning to pull himself up. It was very sturdy and he learned to stand on his own very quickly. It plays &quot;okay&quot; music (It could use a variety) but my son loved it anyway. He learned to dance while standing up with it. He had fun playing while my husband and I had fun watching him play. The only part that I wasn't fond of which also caused some trips and falls were the four legs sticking out (openings where the balls come out) When he attempted to get a ball on the other side, he would lose his balance kicking or stepping on a leg."
"My dog wouldn't touch food that had the Angel Eyes sprinkled on it, despite trying to disguise it in even his favorite food. A waste of money as I will never learn if Angel Eyes really does want it claims."
"My 5 year old got this toy for her birthday. She thinks it's great. I love how it occupies her for a long time because she can switch the cartridges and play by herself.I've had to recalibrate the screen once already in the week she's had it, but it was a fast and easy process.When Grandma made the choice of this toy over the Pixter, she made the right call. Many more options and games to play and learn with.Can't wait for the recharging system to come out.LOVE IT!"
Purchased this product for my 75pound GoldenDoodle who is an absolutely spectacular dog except for the fact that he LOVES to pull on the leash...making walks a real chore. Well this thing is like magic. We went for a walk and I had to stare into Frodo's eyes a couple of times to make sure this was the same dog. Thank you!
I have about five of these towels and they are GREAT. As the ones I own wear out I will be ordering more. Lightweight and highly adsorbent I actually take one or two with me while traveling. Never go without one to the gym.
My boy's love these. I ordered two and gave them as part of their birthday. O' by the way...they are 55 (my husband) and 30 (my son-in-law).
"This laptop toy has lots of games, but they are VERY pixely and not at all intuitive. We've had a hard time figuring out most of them. However, for the price, this little toy d&iacute;ez have a lot of options. Not the best for English language learners."
I have been using this cream for two weeks and just love it. My skin is softer and feels nicer. I have sensitive skin and this product hasn't bothered me nor given me any blemishes (as some creams in the past have). I am delighted to have found this product and feel good recommending it to anyone seeking a great daily facial cream.
This bed looks nice in our home and hides the black dog hair well. Washes well and has held up with several months of use so far.
"Both my boyfriend and I have learned to stay away from this shampoo. For my boyfriend, it makes his fine, light hair very dandruffy. For me, it makes me dark, coarse hair extremely greasy quickly. Even with our completely different hair types, this brand does not agree us. Definitely not recommended!"
"I have used this product for years and am so worried it will be discontinued! Please no! After 4-5 years of using the shades 8.2, 8.3, and 9.2 I have finally de-coded the secret for natural blond hair fading into the abyss! I have always thought the blond shades produced either to ashy-blonde or to reddish-blonde colors. My hairdresser unlocked the secret.. she said try mixing. So I did just that with 8.3 and 9.2 (very carefully) and I am so HAPPY with my results! FInally the perfect shade! My roots always come in but the rest of the hair is a nice color, so I just do the 'root touch up' directions. I also leave it on for 30 minutes, and do 5 minutes of all over colour. I follow the directions pretty spot on other than that. I really got a professional looking color by mixing. But just be careful. I now have half of each to do my next job in a few months.. so none is wasted in the mixing process. Please Loreal.. DO NOT DISCONTINUE THE BEST HAIR COLOUR ON THE MARKET!!!"
"I've been wearing Zino for over 15 years now and it is the only cologne that I wear. It has a distinctive smell that reminds me of nature, with a rich woodsy note. There was a time where I could only find it in one place in Las Vegas, but that has apparently changed and I am glad to see that Amazon now carries it as my bottle is almost empty. I'll be buying more."
"I used this butter twice a day, everyday on my belly during pregnancy and it really worked. I thought avoiding stretch marks was impossible, but this belly butter was amazing. I have stretch marks on my hips from puberty so I know I am prone to get them, but this butter kept them away from my stomach! It is a little greasy (Kind of like vasaline) and will rub on your clothes but it doesnt stain and it is totally worth it. I just wore camis under my clothes so your shirt wont stick to your belly. Buy it and use it!"
"These are SO great for anyone who does a lot of conditioning (coloring, chemical processes, etc.) on their hair. These are a great price for the amount that you get and the exact same quality as the smaller packs you pick up at the BSS. I myself have rather short hair, so they are a little excessive for me, but I'm sure they could EASILY handle a big ol' head of hair without any issue.The shipping is fast and I would/will order again. :)"
"The lazer tag game works well, but a parent should help read the directions, as they can be tough to understand. game works well. The only thing to make it better is more sensors to shoot at. I like it very much though. Thanks."
"My son first found one of these on the playground and for a kuzoo type toy, it is awesome because it really works. It is an annoying kuzoo sound, but very easy to make and manipulate sound with. We bought one the next day."
"My 2 1/2 year old son totally loves Spider-Man. These are great for him because since he is very little and doesn't have that great of finger control he has trouble setting up some action figures. This series is made for a kid his age. They have big feet and not a whole lot of moving joints (just hips, shoulders and neck). He loves this series!!"
"Stratego is an exciting game that my babysitter introduced to us. I play against my ten year-old sister and seven year-old brother all the time. The point is to find a flag, which your opponent has hidden. But to get to the flag, you have to get through bombs and other soldiers. Each type of soldier(General, Marshall, Scout,etc.) has a rated number. The lower the number, the better. But watch out for bombs because anyone can die by those, except soldier type #8- the miner. This teaches good strategy skills while having fun in a challenge that anyone can win!"
Product was as expected and delivered as indicated. Would definitely buy through Amazon again. Price very competitive.
This is a good dog shampoo that works well killing the fleas. It smells good.
"I've used Pacquin's hand cream for many years but have found it increasingly difficult to buy it in my local stores. I couldn't be more delighted that Amazon has it--since it is far better than any other hand cream that I have tried. My hands dry out terribly in the winter, and this cream is the most helpful I can find."
"There isn't a lot to these beds, but they're well-built and the dogs love 'em. It's nice that they're thin...easily folded up or stored behind something. We now have three of these."
Monopoly game itself is great. Fun for everyone in the family and even great for adults who haven't played the game in a long time. The game board itself folds like the original one which is a disappointment. The different kind of money is also cool. My daughter has also started to use the game to help her with adding and subtracting the educational value has gone up
Not a good purchase. My unit shuts off when run on high setting after a couple of minutes. Nothing is obstructing the flow. Thie other setting (low) manages to stay on but dries your hair to a crisp.
"I bought this toy as a gift. It is very interactive and teaches valuable and relevant information. Lots of Modes and games to choose from with good volume, bold keys, clear pronounciations, and nice narrations. A very nice value and gift overall."
"My older sister owns this straightener, and after using it a few times, decided I wanted one of my own. It heats quickly and stays hot. I like the thinner plates because it allows more manueverability close to my scalp without burning myself. I also love the steam feature. I'm usually opposed to the idea of putting a straightener on wet hair, but because of the steam feature, it allows me to do that without damaging my hair. I was worried about the straightener being so hot at first because I didn't want to damage my hair, but I've been using it regularly since August and haven't noticed any problems.I can't believe people pay upwards of $100 for hair straighteners. This is a good product for a good price."
"I do not doubt that this is made of the finest ingredients. I had heard of how amazing this perfume was and how it is made with each bottle being hand poured etc... However, it is incredibly strong and seemed to have a single note of Pikaki/Hawaiian Jasmine which smelled very similar to Gardenia. That may not be the case but it is how it smelled. I get that quality oils do not fade off easily but this was too intense. I could never detect any other notes to soften seemingly pure Gardenia into a unique fragrance. I appreciate perfumes that do not fade but this gave me a two day headache because it wouldn't go away."
"I have always used this product, but was able to order it through Amazon at a substantial discount. Frontline is the only product I use on my dog because of the effectiveness of the product"
"We have had this fountain in our house for several years now, and really like it, so does the cat. I recently bought another one for our vacation place. What they say about not letting the unit run dry, because the motor will burn out is true. I can attest to that. I suggest getting the large auxiliary tank to go with it. That way the water will last about two weeks, depending upon thirst, humidity, and temperature. If you go away, and have someone coming in to look after your cat while you area away, you don't have to worry about their forgetting or not understanding the fountain because it will last so long. Go ahead and get the biggest extra tank."
"I always get many compliments with this floral,fruity,clean scent. I need to by more !!!"
"The boots are made so wonderfully! Very sturdy and showy. Only problem is that an xxxs is still too big for my chihuahua, like an inch and an eighth too big. They would fit a big yorkie maybe or a maltese. The package says an xxxs is for a toy poodle. I would recommend these shoes to anyone with a bigger lap dog, but I will continue to have to look for boots to fit my 3lb chihuahua."
"Just as the other reviewer said, this john allan Ocean shampoo is amazing. It is the only shampoo I can use and have my scalp not be too oily or to dry. Very good calming scent also (not fruity). MenU is also good, but JA edges it out for me. Thouvie only uses the best, so treat yourself to some JA. Ocean! Your hair will thank you. My dog Zeroski loves it too and he's a spoiled punk, so you know it's fly!"
"Just a warning to all who have this toy. Be careful and don't leave this toy around unattended. Plus, make sure to throw it away once the cardboard pieces get old and are falling to pieces. My friends cat recently almost choked to death on the hook that holds the cardboard pieces together. Luckily she eventually threw it up, but it could have turned out very ugly."
"We bought an older version of this recently at a consignment sale. My son Adores this toy. The train is super sturdy and moves well on both carpet and hard flooring. The animals are large and easy to handle. They are interactive in different ways. Most of them make a ratchety noise when you move the legs, the lion has a rattle in his mane and it spins, the alligator squeaks, the panda has rattles in his feet. the hippo's mouth opens etc... As I said, we bought this used and it came with many other animals, and I have since found more to add to our collection as well so we have many more than come with the toy originally. I would say they are pretty easy to find if you wanted to do the same. In addition to being easy to handle, they are also very durable. My son has dropped/ thrown them on hard floors many times. No damage done to the toy. Our version of the train sings a couple different songs when activated, and while catchy and informative, good for learning about animal characteristics, they get old after the 57th time.... LOL We found ourselves talking back to the nice woman singing them... The whistle next to the smokestack plays different animal sounds also. We found that if you accidentaly start the song, if you press the whistle and it cuts it off with an animal noise. Overall, its a great toy. It has stood up to our son standing on it, trying to ride it and generally playing like little boys do, and its no worse for wear, and ours is an older version anyways.... I say its a great investment."
"I had high hopes for this as it got positive reviews. It doesn't seem to do much. But it is just average, nothing special."
"I wish I had read all the reviews. The tambourine broke immediately!. The maracas and cymbals are barely audible. Very poor quality, disappointing for Melissa and Doug."
"This product line recommended by my Dermatologist, and could not find it locally, so ordered from Amazon. I have used it 5 days now and cannot believe how well its working. I have allergic/ dermatitis and my scalp was a mess.A Hypo-allergic shampoo/conditioner combo purchased from Sallys was actually making it worse! Felt better and 50% improvement within 2 days using this. Yes, does dry out hair but if you need for a specific condition,I recommend.Was soothing and lathers well. An after shampoo product, used on my ends only, helps with dryness, and keeps my scalp free to heal."
"We, Seniors, have enjoyed this game after playing other domino type of games. Only wish company would make a larger set ; not just set of 6. Game goes too fast. But, good for brain and eyes and coordination. I would recommend this game for all ages."
"If you loved the original Bang!, then this is a must have. A whole new set of new characters, new cards, and new rules adds a whole new layer of strategy and fun to an already great game."
"I've been using this product for two weeks now. I can honestly already see some results. I have excessive thinning/balding in the crown of my head due to stress and chemicals. I can tell that hair is filling in, this if very promising. I use this product every other evening and just massage it into the scalp in the balding areas followed by a rich hair moisturizing lotion. Then, once a week I use the 16oz rebuilder as a deep conditioner along with a super hydrating deep conditioner and apply heat for 25-30 minutes. This seems to be working for me. The MegaTek is very high in protein, so be sure to keep your hair well moisturized. Also, I notice some bad headaches when I use this, may just be due to the massaging and increased circulation. Love the fragrance too."
"This seems to be a very nicely made leash. It is attractive and appears to be very strong. The clip is a nice spring loaded one that is easy to attach to a collar or harness. The loop is large enough to easily place your hand through. My complaint is not with the leash but with the shipping container. This leash could have been shipped in a bubble bag but instead came in a 14"" X 20"" X 4"" carton filled with 20 air bags. This is a totally irresponsible waste of oil (plastic bags) and trees (cardboard carton). Whoever was responsible for this, needs a lecture on responsible packaging."
"I bought this for my four sons. They all thougt it was very cool and it worked ok for a couple of days. Now the ferris wheel get's stuck all the time. It is also very noisy. I agree with the other reviewers that it is difficult to find cars that work with the ferris wheel. Most of the ones we have just fall off. This is a problem with many of these types of playsets (we also have the Cyborg set and it has the same issues)! Overall, pretty cool, but they need to work on some of the problems."
"Bought this for European travel plans. Tried it once and it seemed to work well, but does not fit my needs, so I will be returning it. I use a blow dryer to style my hair and usually use a dryer with a longer barrel. The shorter barrel on this dryer made the airflow blow my hair all around, preventing me from styling. The longer barrel lets me concentrate the airflow to the area I am styling. For just getting your hair dry, this one is probably fine."
"I'd used it for a couple years. I thought it had helped initially, but since I wasn't certain that it was still helping I stopped it. I had significant hair loss, that stopped when I went back on the Procerin."
"We bought this toy for my speech delayed 2-year old and she loves it. She is obssessed with the alphabet and constantly brings the little magnets to us and tells us what letter it is. She knows the entire alphabet now and the alphabet song. What I really like about this toy is that it gives multiple sounds for the letters that need them, unlike her favorite alphabet phonics video. We couldn't be happier with this toy!"
This stuff is horrid! My husband bought this and it makes me so so sick. It smells like baby powder and nastiness! I hate it.
"A very unique fragrance - feminine but not sweet or weak, rather for a strong but tender and classy women. Too bad it has been discontinued."
"We bought this for my grandson Christmas 2007. He was 8+ months at that time. His father (my son) is 6'7"", so my grandson is very tall for his age. This little train fit his size well.There are all kinds of neat things to play with on the train, a top sort of thing on the steering wheel, a horn, and there is a secret compartment under the seat.Besides just being as cute as can be, this toy seems to be quite sturdy. He did tip over on it once, as some other reviewers have mentioned and I told my son about putting a weight in the compartment; I don't know if he ever did that or not.I don't know about the educational aspect of this toy, so gave it 4 stars. It does have a lot of little activities on it. I could happily recommend this toy for toddlers."
"this isnt jean paul gaultier. i have been using it since 2005 i know what it smells like. the bottle cap has scores on it from tampering, and the spray cap that was rolling around in the box doesnt fit properly, besides the fact that it leaked into the box and smelled up the box-so it wasnt even completely full. i am surprised because amazon usually doesnt pull this crap. even someone who never used jean paul gaultier would know something was up with this amateurish attempt at theivery. i will get my money back or i will go to small claims in santa monica, its as simple as that."
"I bought this book for my five years old daughter. She really loves it and learn a lot from it, although it is a little bit difficult for her age."
"My son loves his Leapster and all the games we've bought for it, but he really loves learning things that Mom doesn't know and then informing me of ""Did you know"" about all the animals on this game. I'm glad I bought it."
"My 2 year old granddaughter still plays with this even after 1 year. She is just getting to the point where she is able to match up the correct pieces. But, the banjo music part of the toy really sticks in one's head! All of us have been imitating the catchy songs it emits when a particular button is pressed! But, Natalie still uses the toy on every visit and it is one of her favorites. I can see this toy being used about 1 more year. Definitely a great value for the money!"
"I ordered the tie on eye patch. Lo and behold, they came with elastic! However my husband was VERY pleased with the elastic. So I guess this seller is somehow psychic!!!"
My 10 pound Japanese Chin loves this seat! She loves to look out when we travel and now she can do it safely. It also must be comfortable because she falls asleep in it very quickly. I was completely surprised when my neighbor's small dog immediately jumped into it when I left my door open. It is well constructed and study. I'm very pleased with this product and consider it a great value.
I bought this as a gift for a picky friend and she could not have been more delighted. She hadn't smelled it before but loved it's complexity without being heavy. I may have to get some for myself. *grin*
"I bought several flea combs at once to find a good one since I couldn't tell from pictureswhat the teeth spacing was like or the quality of the combs. My dog had a thick doublecoat and I was concerned about being able to comb through to get fleas since combing himwould result in a comb full of the undercoat hairs no matter how much he was brushed prior.This is a review of Safari Flea Comb for Dogs with wood handle.This flea comb seems to have a bigger space between the teeth, and didn't remove fleasas easily as other combs. Also it rusted fast within the first week of use.I used the comb along with bathing of my dog since with wet fur it was easier to spotthe red-brown fleas or Dog Flea ( Ctenocephalides canis ) that are more flat with fatrears. Dog fleas' strategy was to grip the fur and stay on,making me have to comb several times on the flea to try to dislodge it, Sometimes the fleawas very good and scraping and combing the flea would take awhile to get it loose.Also, this comb isn't very useful for Cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) since thosecat fleas have smaller black bodies that are narrow and easily crawl out of the teeth tohop away if I didn't thrust my comb into soapy water fast enough, and yes I tried to getthem in the soap water asap, into a separate bowl. Fleas are sneaky and like to crawlup the dog to air if the dog is sitting in water, soap water also makes it harder forthe black colored Cat Flea to use its wings for a big hop away escape.Bottom line is this comb was a big disappointment and waste of money.The best comb that I wish I had and knew about years ago was an all metal flea comb[[ASIN"
"This is an intense, spicy herbal scent. If it is to be worn, a single drop will be enough. I purchased it for use as a room fragrance, because I previously had a half-ounce bottle of it and liked it very much for that purpose."
"I bought this for my daughter who has dry yet very oily hair. She needs to wash her hair every day but that is supposedly bad so we decided to buy the Batiste. After using it for a week she already has little dry patches but they had become so irritated that they just became huge and out of control. Her hair became very dry and dull looking. We stopped using it and have been washing her hair again with dandruff shampoo. We have it back under control. I do not recommend this to anyone with oily, dry hair. It will irritate and aggrivate your dandruff even more."
I truly love the fountain and the filters are a great product for the money ....they are easy to put in and easy to clean and my cat drinks almost every time he passes it which is what the Vet recommended for his kidney problem. Love them.
Its kinda big but it holds a lot and was easy to install. Its been up a five months and haven't had any problems! It has stuck on the tile perfectly. I love the shelf for shampoos. It holds all our bath toys and baby products. Highly recommend. And its cute!
"The product has a very bad description, so I though I need to write some details. It does not specify the size, but great that they say it's 100% natural.So, it smells bad and looks very small, but my dog loves it! Maybe it's just small for my 100 lbs Cane Corso... On the back of the pack it says to give 2-3 stix a day for dogs that size. Each stick is about 5 in long and 1/2 in diameter. They are very hard, but my dog does not have any problems chewing it. It goes away in about 1 min. When he fells that he is going to get it, he starts ""dancing"".I cannot say anything about its function, my dog only got stix few times. But he likes them even though they have a terrible smell. I would buy again."
"I have read some of the more negative reviews about this cologne, and my experience has been very different. The picture is incorrect, the product is Diesel Green, not Special Edition. It arrived quickly and in excellent condition (no leaking). I find the scent to be pleasant - citrus, clean, and fresh, but not very strong. I would give this as a gift and purchase again in the future. I like to have several scents on hand and for this price, it's ideal (and others have commented positively on the scent when I wear it)."
"I have two cats, one male one female, and the female has had sporadic issues with using the litterbox. It was getting progressivly worse, and eventually got to the point where I was cleaning up messes at least once per day. She would use the litterbox sometimes, and other times go right next to or in front of it. I had her checked out for health issues, and my vet said she was fine, and to try this litter and get a second litter box.I kept one litterbox with their old litter, and one new one with this Cat Attract litter. My male cat used the Cat Attract right away, but my female cat used the old litter for the first day. The next day, she was using the new Cat Attract litter. It's been about a week now, and my female cat is now using the new Cat Attract consistenly, and actually burying everything after she goes too! (Before she would not bury anything) I also like the litter itself, clumps well, low dust and pretty good odor control. Both cats now use the new litter, but I still keep the old litter in the second box, so there is always a clean litterbox just in case. This Cat Attract is such a life saver! I'm happy, my cats are happy, and I can stop thinking about having to keep her confined to a small space, or taking her to a shelter. It might not work for everyone, but definetely worth trying if you have a cat with litterbox issues - just give it a day or two to start working."
"The castle is adorable and my twins play with it daily. They are 4 years old and put on the stickers in far less time than 2 hours! The crown, I have to admit, could have been omitted, though they do use it when they play with their Barbie fashion heads. So far, in the last 6 months, we haven't had any problems with pieces falling off, so nothing has to be glued yet."
"This is one of the few shampoos that I can use where my hair actually feels clean. It runs for about $8.50 on the Aveda website and in their stores so I would suggest buying ti from there (plus you get free samples!). The smell is great too. Even though it seems like you're not getting a lot of product, you don't have to use as much and the quality is amazing. For everyone who has bought a bottle of crap shampoo or an expensive shampoo that turned out to be crap you would be wise to give Aveda products a shot. I have never bought something from them that I disliked and that says a lot about me because when it comes to hair care I am EXTREMELY picky."
"I got this last year for my 11th birthday. I LOVE to play with it, its really fun. It easily fits 3 stablemate horses, and there is room for 3 saddles. It has a pull-out ramp, and a stand that can be pulled out so the trailer stands on its own. I play with it all of the time, and the only thing that has broken is two of the tabs that are part of the thing that goes on the truck bed to attach the trailer, and that is my fault.I recommend this for kids 8+. Oh, and, do not try to cram more than to people in the cab!I tried it, and my person broke.I fixed her with tape, though.Hope you find this helpful!"
"We've had this game over a year and like it, for the most part. The part we don't like is that it has a programming flaw. Radica has known about the built-in programming error for at least two years, and still has not fixed it. It's so annoying, we would actually buy a new model to escape it. As mentioned by other reviewers, the error is that when you deplete the deck, at any time, your points are heavily docked - even if you haven't yet gone through the deck three times.It's supposed to work like this... You lose points when you"
"This Kong was a gift from my puppy, Velcro, to per pawpal puppy, Lizzie.Lizzie loves her kong. Her human mom, Anna, and her human sister break up the treats in various sizes before putting them into the Kong. That way some pieces come out easily while Lizzie has to work for others.Lizzie and Velcro could be poster children for Kongs."
We purchased the Fridge Phonics for our daughter when she was about 13 months old to keep her entertained in the kitchen while I cooked or cleaned up after meals. She learned a few letters very quickly and by the time she was 22 months she could identify 18 out of 26 letters of the alphabet - all without any help from Mommy and Daddy. What a great start to her education by just playing and having fun! I've given this as gifts to several friends and it has been a hit every time.
This product gives excellent coverage to grey hair. I just wet it and apply and it blends very well with my natural hair color. It washes out easily with water. I would definitely buy it again.Roux Temporary Haircolor Touch-Up Stick Dark Brown
"I was looking for a different bingo game that didn't involve small parts and was more than just numbers. I took a chance on this one and boy is our family enjoying it! It's been a month and almost everyday our 3 year old wants to play this game. It's very durable, no small parts and easy to play. In fact even the adults have a good time with this one! I highly , highly recommend it!"
I brought this product and to be honest it did nothing it says!...I actually went out and brought a cheaper product that did work for me. Not only that I tried getting my money back from the company. And someone (I guess CSR) was very nasty told me I had to send back what ever I had to get my money back and when I was still asking questions they hung up the phone before I could finish...I wouldn't recommend to a dog! I don't even want to give a rating they don't even deserve a star at all!
"We purchased this litter box approximatley 2 weeks ago from PetSmart. For the first couple of days, this item worked perfectly. However, over the following days, I noticed that the green light was not on intermittently. I checked and checked the top/lid and eventualy the light would come back on.One thing I did not like about this litterbox during the next twoo weeks, is the area the cat has to do its ""duty"" is very small, and many times, they would leave their ""presents"" on the lid of the unit, which defeats the purpose of this item.The last time I changed out the litter, which was three days ago, the light was on after I was finished. I noticed today that the green light was not on again, and looked as if it had only been on for a few hours after the cleaning by the contents of the ""bucket"" in the rear. I took the top off, checked to make sure everything it was where it should be, but no matter what I did, the green light would not come on. I disassembled the unit, and put it back together, still no green light.I called PetSafe to discuss this item with them, and they advised me since I did not have the receipt from PetSmart, that they could not help me. I also advised them that I had just tripped over the unit, and caught my foot on the edge of the unit, where tangs hang over and out from the product, and cut my foot approximately 1"" and it did bleed. I advised the I really hoped that my foot did not get infected since it was cut on a sharp point protruding from the bowl that is used by cats to urniate in and deficate in (although I did scrub it, and apply antibiotic to it). I did not get a response. I then asked to speak to a supervisor, and was put on hold. After approximately two minutes, I was told that all supervisors were in a meeting. How convenient.Poor quality product, and poor customer service. I am out of over $100.00 in two weeks time. It is a sad state that no matter what you buy these days, you must keep a receipt due to cheaply and poor quality items."
"an inexpensive inter-active toy for your cats. It moves erratically when using it, so it keep the cat's interest. Our 3 kitten/cats (all under 10 months old) love it. Gave 4 stars because after a half hour or more of play, it bothers our fingers. Would prefer to have some sort of handle on it, but for the price, you can't go wrong."
"This dog toy greatly disappointed me because of the 8 curled legs that were attached to the body and could of easily been chewed off and possibly get caught in the animals throat. When I first received the toy, one of the legs were already coming apart. I had to return because of this. I have the dragon and the chameleon toys in this same line and love them."
"These walkie talkie thingys are SO fun! They're easy to play with... I rated the durability 3 stars because on one of mine the batteries already ran out but they only take 3 AAA batteries. One problem with it is that I think it's for kids a little bit younger than me because the head set is kinda small and it's not ajustable (only the part you look into is ajustable) and when I'm playing with it with my sister, I always end up taking the part you look into off of the headset and just look at it while holding it up to my eyeball. My sister just keeps it on and complains about it hurting. I think the key-pad is easier to use if you don't strap it to your arm, but my sister says it's easier when you DO strap it to your arm. I'm weird so just go with my sister... strap it to your arm. Overall, this thing is pretty fun... even though I'm a girl and people might think this is just for boys, it's still real fun... I usually use it in my own way, by not wearing the headset and not straping it to my arm because I think it's easier, but hey... that's my opinion. I recomend it to anyone (boys or girls) who like spy kinda stuff..."
Order came in very quick and was exactly what I wanted. The product looked untouched and the quality was great.
My cats absolutely loved to get on my kitchen counters and drink from any dish I had in the sink. I tried everything
works for a while than gets old. just get the cosmic catnip that u can put in old sock and Cats go crazy over it.Thanks
Little People -- Always a hit with the toddlers regardless of gender. This one does not fall short of that expectation. The recipient started playing as soon as it was opened. Great job Fisher-Price!
My daycare kids like the frog but it confuses them because they keep hitting the language button. I think it would have been better to have a switch on it's back to use to change the language. But other then that the toy is great and very fun!
"Got this for our 17-month old at Christmas. He absolutely loved it and ran all over the house pulling this behind him. It makes a great clackity-clack noise that is quite loud on tile or hardwood floors, but then again, that's what makes it so much fun. It's very durable - our son often is so excited that the poor alligator gets pulled on its side while he runs around with it until it finds its way back onto its wheels. Haven't tried it on carpet, but it does work well on throw rugs and the sound is dampened a bit."
"Star Trek original series fans have had few options for obtaining a realistic-looking phaser. Classmates made a version that was not full-size. Collectors versions can be great, but are very expensive. Now, Art Asylum has produced a plastic toy that is full-size, extremely faithful to the original prop, and very well engineered. The phaser 1 detaches and reattaches to the phaser 2 body very securely. The sounds are reasonably faithful to the original, although they could be a bit louder. The emitter in front has some nice light effects. Yes, this is a toy, and only plastic. It is not collector quality. But for the price, it's very cool. For under $20.00, the Star Trek nut (like me) can't go wrong with this phaser."
"Chewbacca finally gets Unleashed, but it's not the best sculpt that Hasbro could have done to really do justice to everyone's favorite Wookie. The pose is slightly awkward and the display stand representing the green Endor forest tundra is fairly dull compared to others from this incredible Unleashed line. I would much rather have seen them include a display stand as exciting as the Millenium Falcon ramp that came with Han Solo Unleashed, or perhaps part of the Death Star Detention Block when the ""captive"" Chewbacca breaks out of his shackles and ""unleashes"" on the Imperial officers, or when Chewie ""unleahes"" his wrath on Lando for selling out Han and choking him to his knees. Even a Trash Compactor base would have been more exciting then this, but then again, the latest wave of Unleashed figures is not exactly the best they've done to date. I'm much more looking forward to the upcoming Bossk Unleashed wave, but for now, I'm just glad to see this big Walking Carpet finally get Unleashed."
"We've got 6 cats, and bought one of these Littermaid boxes about two years ago. With this many cats, it doesn't take long for the box to jam up, and require manual scraping. It seems as if two cats use it in a row, before it has a chance to scrape after the first cat, you have a guaranteed jam.The box is very sensitive to the amount of litter you put in - just a touch too much and it won't be able to complete the sweep, and will keep trying over and over, annoying you to no end. Not enough litter and you have a hard mess to scrape off the plastic bottom.Maybe they should be lining these with some kind of teflon like a frying-pan has! We always keep a 4&quot; scraper next to the box and need to use it daily. What fun to clean out the &quot;teeth&quot; of the litter comb when the cat potties on them.The first box we had lasted just over a year before it's motor died.We replaced that one, reluctantly, with another by Littermaid, and now after about 7 months, somehow it managed to grab the wire in the &quot;teeth&quot; that provides power to the moving comb and when it got to the end to dump, it snapped the wire in half and stopped. For Good...I can fix darn-near anything, so I disassembled it with intentions of rewiring this part, but it seems they are using some special &quot;extra flexible&quot; wire that cannot be found at Home Depot or Radio Shack. They have this cheezy way of providing a retracting action of the wire with some spring steel and some plastic wheels.Anyway, now I have a second &quot;dead&quot; littermaid unit, and will likely have to buy yet a third one, since nobody else makes an automatic litterbox. Next time I will keep the warranty info someplace where I can find it!"
I paid $12.00 for 14 pills at the vet! I was delighted to find them here for so much less!!
"I Absolutley LOVE the show Lost, because it plays with my mind and gives me something to think about, and that's exactly what the board game did aswell. It's almost as if you make your own episode, or your own season when you play the game! But as others have clearly noted, it isn't like a normal game, and the instructions could have been better written. If you are a person who really doesn't like putting time into things, then no, i suggest you don't get this game, but if your like me and really get into things that give you a challenge, then go for it, get the game, take a bit of time to solve it, then play it! Nonthless, it's a game exactly alluding to it's show! Once you get used to it, It's a GREAT GAME! Overall i rate it 4 out of 5, and congratualte the makers on their fine efforts!"
"This is a great learning toy. I work in the Infants Room and the babies are ages 2 months to 11 months. The babies are all at different abilities and this toy makes it so that the babies that are just starting to stand can lean against it and feel like big kids. The feet unlock in seconds making it a great floor toy as well! The only thing I would fix on this toy is to make the feet not be able to skid on the floor. I have to put it up against something to make it not move as the babies that are just learning to stand and are leaning on it tend to lean and push their weight on it so it slowly, eventually, moves away from them and they fall if they are not closely watched. But they do all love it! And it has the Spanish feature which is SO great here in Albuquerque, New Mexico. They hear words in their own language and it encourages them to learn new words. It is really a great toy and so very durable. They have yet to break anything on it! I love it! So do they! Thank you!"
My husband put this in my Christmas stocking. I used to be able to buy it locally but the shop went out of business so I was very happy to receive this wonderful lotion.
"Smells great...doesn't last that long. Thought it was me, asked others...they all agreed. We couldn't smell anything after a couple of hours. What a waste of money."
"This beautiful Lupine ""Cherry Blossom"" leash gives a look reminiscent of needlepoint. The quality is excellent. Padding makes it very comfortable on your hand. This wonderful product is made in the USA. The only disppointment for me is that, while this is excellent for my puppy, they do not have a heavier leash available in the ""Cherry Blossom"" pattern for the days ahead when she is full grown. Hopefully they will have it available by then."
"The game is fun but we kind of had to make up our own way of playing. The instructions are somewhat unclear and confusing.Definitely gives you enough questions, I think around 100."
"This game is a cute boardgame geared towards preschool age and early elementary school aged princesses. Boys need not play. They definitely won't want too with the Princess movers, princess references (the game really feeds into the princess craze!), and bright pink box. The game includes a game board, thick cardboard matresses (the real user pictures appear to have plastic beds, but this is not the case), 4 cardboard princess movers with little stands, and a spinner. Assembly is minimal. The object of the game is to get the most mattresses and become the true princess. The game requires some reading. My 5 year old reads, but my 3.5 year old does not. Both can play though with the reader helping the 3.5 year old. The concept is actually pretty simple, so children younger than the 5+ can play with reading assistance. The game is quick too, which is good for short attention spans.The main flaw is the movers. They are one sided. All of the stands are purple and all of the backs are hot pink. In order to easily keep track of which mover is which, the movers must face the ""wrong way,"" looking away from the goal rather than towards it. The movers should be double sided or the bases should be color coordinated with the movers to make it easier to locate the correct movers."
"I cannot do without this conditioner! Prior to using this for the first time (introduced by my stylist) I ALWAYS had to use a leave-in detangler after conditioning just to brush or comb through my long, fine, and processed hair.My hair is extremely dry on the ends and tangles easily, yet I need no other conditioner. Leave on for 2-3 mins, rinse and comb thru EASILY. (It also doubles great for shaving and smells wonderful). The Shampoo is also fantastic - none of that stiff, waxy feel on my hair -just shiny, smooth, and very soft, touchable. After years of hating my hair, I actually enjoy looking at and touching it."
"My daughter spotted this at a garage sale and we bought it because it was compatible with her Leapster 2 and came with 2 games. We paid $7 which I figure was worth it in games alone. The system is basic and does not respond as well as the hand held. As for the graphics, it's kind of like pictures...if you start with low resolution it only gets worse when you enlarge it. My daughter, however, is enjoying it because she can play on the big TV. I guess, in the end, that is really what it is about and heck, it was only $7."
I use to get my dogs bully sticks at a local pet store but they moved. The other pet stores that carry them charge more and they didn't like them very much. I just ordered these for the first time and they were delivered yesterday. I have seen some that are extremely thin so I was glad to see that these were a decent size. They did smell pretty bad when I first opened the package but since then they have aired out and I don't notice them much. I've bought other ones that have smelled far worse. My dogs liked these ones so I would definitely recommend.
"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002MABGE/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThe Highland 20045 pet barrier for a car is not very secure, it is hard to tighten it so it sits secured in one place; it has a tendency to fall out of place by itself, can injure a pet."
"My nephew is in love with McQueen and from what I understand, makes his parents watch ""Cars"" almost everyday. My parents got him the bed and he loves it. I am glad we read prior reviews because it makes great sense to put the stickers on first before assembly. Once the stickers were on, it took no more than 20 minutes to put all the pieces together. My nephew is convinced that his race car bed ""goes fast"" when he is sleep. Well worth the price to see the smile on his face."
"The kong toy is the best dog toy I have ever purchased. I bought one for my golden retreiver when he was a puppy and five years later, the kong is still his favorite toy. Even better, the kong is still in great condition. There is no visible wear to the toy, even though Tucker chews and gnaws on his kong on a regular basis."
"This set is easily meant for collectors, not casual players, especially since it now costs $52. The individual limited edition rare cards this set comes with are classics. The packs it comes with are pretty good as well, though I've never liked Pharaoh's Servant or Legacy of Darkness.My Pulls:Legend of Blue Eyes - Flame Ghost (Rare)Metal Raiders - Harpy Lady Sisters (Super Rare)Spell Ruler - Invader of the Throne (Super Rare)Pharaoh's Servant - Magic Drain (Rare)Labyrinth of Nightmare - Card of Safe Return (Ultra Rare)Legacy of Darkness - Bottomless Trap Hole (Rare)"
This is the second Conair Hot Brush that I have purchased over the last 11 years. It has multiple heat settings for styling and the auto off is great feature. The combs last through the various styling products used. Tolerates any travel conditions including trips to the gym. I recommend this product and I'm considering purchasing a back-up in case Conair stops manufacturing this one!
"This was to be a gift for a lady in her 80s--one of us who remembers ""Evening in Paris"" from the 50s or earlier--so I did not open the package, but it was attractive and looked the way I thought it should have. I also wasn't there when she opened the bottle, but was told later that this was the stuff. I bought it from Perfume Station (through Amazon), and shipping was quick and excellent. I would buy this again, and I would buy it from Perfume Station."
This is a great product if you like the challenge of hitting a drive straight and love to play with your dog in the park. After 15 swings I dialed it in! I love it and I think my real golf swing is better for it!Awesome - Go Doggie Driver!
"I bought this because my neighbor complained my dog would bark a bit too much for too long at the postman or the UPS guy. I placed it by the front door. And it worked immediately. Dog learned to just growl softly when the UPS guy knocked, low enough i guess that it didn't trigger the beep. I would highly recommend you give this a try. I am using it indoors. The cord is plenty long to reach just about anywhere. and it is a small enough that I can hide it behind something to be inconspicuous, or tuck in a drawer when I don't need it out."
I love these. I can find them at Wal-mart. I wish they were on the Amazon Subscribe and Save program.
"My sons loves this game! He plays with it as it's intended, then takes the cars off and plays with them separately. It's challenging enough to keep him busy for a while, too. Definitely recommend!"
"The Furminator removes about four times as much hair from our Golden mix dog as did a standard dog rake-type brush. It seems to be comfortable for the dog as it has no sharp teeth and he enjoys the massage. We purchased the medium size, but perhaps a large would have been more efficient. Expensive- but worth it."
"My daughter and I could sit and play with this toy for hours. It is fun for me too! A great way to spend time with your child. My daughter sits there playing with it and laughing so loud... it's cute. Wonderful toy, especially for the price."
My wife wanted this dual purpose iron since it can to the job of 2 different devices without the clutter. It also has dual voltage which comes in handy if you like to travel. Amazon definately had the best value so we went ahead and ordered it. It arrived in a timely manner.She tried it out and was very happy with it. It really does heat up quickly and performs well. The only problem I saw with it is the short cord. We have other Conair irons and they all came with longer cords.
"I purchased for my son, followed the directions very carefully and product did not work on his brown hair. We tried twice, leaving the product on longer and still no results. I contacted the company for a refund and were told that since the product was opened I could not return. Will never, ever purchase another product from this company. Extremely disappointed with the company and the product."
"Tried this brand because unlike other major(cough)brands selling grapeseed oil, this isn't processed using hexane (a terrible chemical that is used in many skincare products). I called the customer and they told me they do not. Leaves your skin smooth as a baby's bottom! I'll never stray from Hobe."
I buy 2 at a timeOur Vet claims it will help prevent dental problems so we don't have to do dental cleaning so often.So far it appears to be working (4 months)
I love my Chi!!!!! It works so perfect and straightens my hair in half of the time as my Hot Tools Iron did.
"I bought these for a little boy I babysit. He's absolutly in LOVE with Toy Story and Cars, so I figured that these would be the perfect compromise for the kid that seemingly has everything, being the only child and only grandkid on both sides of the family. They're very cute, but I had it in my mind that they'd be... bigger. Maybe I'm just thinking of the toy cars that my cousins and I used to play with, but each car is very tiny. All in all, though, they seem great for the price and I'm very excited to give them to him for his birthday."
I decided to ignore the other reviews thinking it couldn't be as bad as what people said. This curler made my really straight hair straighter than before I started curling it. It maybe would curl my ends if I used enough hairspray and held it in the curl for a long time. Also the cord is not very long and the tip (as other reviewers have said) is pretty hot to hold on too. Do not purchase
"I strongly recommend brushing dog teeth. We've been brushing our two dogs' teeth their whole lives (7 years) and their teeth are white and their breath is fresh. Our previous two dogs began getting their teeth brushed late in their lives, after both had many rotten teeth removed. Even their teeth improved and their breath got better.I am surprised by the price increases in the past few years. Although much, much cheaper than store-bought, the price for the 6.2 ounce tube of Petrodex on Amazon.com has gone from $4.49 in 2007 to $5.74 in 2009 to $6.86 in 2010. Despite the slow economy, with practically no inflation, the price has increased over 50% in 3 years!"
Dear Conair
I have had my litter maid cat box for over two years now.I have two cats and my one cat still hisses at the box once in a while but he has never stopped using it(he's a big chicken about everything).My sister is getting married and she and her fiance asked for a littermaid as their wedding gift.I am getting them the best model available.It is money well spent.If my model were to break tomorrow I would buy another in a heart beat!Dump the containers often and don't use too much litter and your life will be breeze(a fresh smelling one)!
"I purchased this for my children, a boy 8 and a daughter almost 10. My son seems to enjoy it the most. It is not terribly high-tech, but they do learn things. It works by inputting the card number into the laptop and lights blink on the sides of the cards where terms or titles are listed. The picture on the card has numbers and you type in the number that corresponds with the word beside the blinking light. For example, a card of geographical features lists things like Island, Peninsula, Plain, Cape, Cove, etc. and the picture has numbers pointing to various geographical features so the child has to type in the number to match the definition with the pictured landform. So low tech, but they enjoy it. It doesn't talk but beeps when the answer given is wrong. There is a +/- key to adjust the volume. One or two can play.The cards are included and it only takes batteries (AA). I stupidly purchased the AC Adapter that comes up under ""other things you might be interested in"" and there is nowhere to plug it into the laptop. The older version of the laptop for younger kids does use an adapter."
"I purchased this item to use for a Siberian Husky puppy and was very disappointed when it arrived. The sides which show a dog resting its head on are barely able to hold up my hand. With only the slightest pressure the sides cave in and fold over which defeats the purpose. The bottom is VERY thin and can be pinched between two fingers. Your pet might as well be laying on the carpet. The ""sherpa"" cover is also extremely thin and not very soft. It is more like a car buffing material. Lastly the item I received was very dirty on the foam bottom so it was probably returned from previous purchaser. If you love or even care for your pet even a little do not buy this so called bed!"
"I bought the XS size for our 7 pound chihuahua-minpin mix. Given that there's not a lot of room to fit in the extra specail features like mesh over the tummy, this PFD does everything very well. The clip across the chest is far better than the double-thickness velcro style, the orange color and reflective tape are highly visible when she tries to hide under the sofa, and the handle on the back is easy to grab and still low-profile enough to not create a hazard for her to catch on things. Excellent value!"
"This fragrance is an attention getter for me. Everywhere I go, I receive a compliment on how good I smell. I have been wearing it for years, and I believe we have a great chemistry."
"These hot rollers are not the best but not the worset.Pros....They heat up fast and do not take long at all to get curls in your hair. They come with two sizes of curlers which allows you to have some creativity. There is 10 of each size which allows you to have enough of just one size curl if that is the look you are after. The curls last all day as long as you allow them to cool before running your fingers through them and of course stay away from brushing them unless you want to relax them to just soft body.Cons....No matter how hard I try I am unable to get curls without the clips creating lines in my hair. While I have read some reviews that you can fix this with touching up with a straight iron I refuse to spend money on a hot roller set that does not allow me to fix my hair with speed. Not to mention the added damage drying my hair, curling with the hot rollers and then having to use a flat iron. That does not seem convenient to me nor healthy for my hair.Bottom line....while they work if you do not want lines in your hair left by clips then keep looking for another hot roller set."
"It's totally cool as a gift for people & it is also cool, since it glows in the dark."
"Just your basic Klondike and Vegas solitaire. Some other variations would have been a real plus. But this is still good Solitaire fun. The cards are especially easy to see on the big screen and are very easy to move, unlike other handheld games. The On/Off switch for the sound is a good idea if you need quiet, though the sound is not at all annoying. If you are looking for a good handheld basic solitaire, this is the one."
"After going to the hairdresser and her telling me that my hair was extremely dry, I decided to give this line a try. I've used practically everything, from Nexxus to Paul Mitchell, Mizani to Biolage. Nothing has worked. Yes...this shampoo is very pricey, but I went back to the hairdresser less than two weeks after I bought this shampoo (and the 5-vial treatment from their Resistance line and the anti-frizz serum), and she noticed a HUGE difference in the moisture level of my hair. I can honestly say that I finally believe that I'm on my way to healthier, stronger, and hopefully, longer, hair!"
"I have a 25lb Pug/Boston Terrier mix and he can chew through anything. We have had this ball for at least 6 months and it looks like new. We play catch inside and outside nearly every day, not to mention he chews on it non-stop. By far the best toy I have ever bought him!!!"
"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter because she sucks on her thumbs sooo much. We love this product since it does the job its supposetoo BUT!!! if you are using this for a toddler, make sure you have a bib or towl close by, my daughter is drooling all over the place. The first time she sucked her thumb, she gagged and almost puked,i kept a trash can near her so if she needs to spit she does it in there. This stuff works!!**UPDATE** my daughter i guess got amune to the taist, shes back to sucking her thumb :( i duno how!! because this stuff taist nasty! i must have one tough toddler.. :("
"Roll, tilt, and you're done. What a great, simple concept! No more having to bend to scoop out individual clumps of poop or pee and spend 5 minutes or more in doing so. It all comes out easily into a tray which you can then dispose of into the toilet or the garbage (depending on which litter type you have, some are not septic tank safe). I use it with Precious Cat litter and the clumping works great. All you have to do is add litter as is necessary when it runs low. No need to dump all the litter, add liners and add new sand, this litter box contains odors very well thanks to its lid. Make sure all the snaps are in place unless you want to risk having sand go on your floor.."
i got some of this good smelling stuff and Yes Lawd it made me smell so good i had to spray myself three times and again. this is the stuff that is gonna make the bumble bees check you out in the winter time. real fly smelling stuff.
"Our dog will not eat the Wellness Wellbar Yogurt, Apples and Bananas Dog Treats; however, we crush two of these up for each daily feeding and mix them with his regular dog food. For this reason I would not buy these crunchy treats again, although I must say they smell good!We feel the reason for his not eating the crunchy treats is that he is accustomed to the soft Wellness wellbites that we have been giving him for over a year. He loves these.Wellness WellBar Yogurt, Apples and Bananas Dog Treats, 50-Ounce Pouch"
I swim twice a week and was using this shampoo along with the Aubrey swimmer's conditioner. After using the shampoo my hair would feel stiff and straw-like. Within a few weeks my hair was breaking like crazy and dull and lifeless. The ingredient that is supposed to help with chlorine is organic corn syrup.
"This item is much better that a shock collar. Shock collars are downright creepy.. AND I'm a hunter so I harvest animals legally.Shock collars hurt your dog in such a way that makes them bark again in pain and then in return get shocked again! WTH is up with that?Dogs are the smartest animals on earth and need very little steering. Hurting and tormenting a dog is a very bad thing and causesthem to be violent and we all know what bad press some dogs get.I love this product so far but you must do a few things correctly:1) has to be snug (not tight) on the pups vocal box area.2) the switch needs to be in the ""on"" position.. don't laugh! I missed it the first go round.3) must be filled with the citro (same no laughing)4) I recommend using it at times when you DON'T want your dog to bark.. ie"
"A bit pricy, but hey its your face right? Very light, no greasy. Like the SPF. Def continue with this product."
Best deshedder so far. Works great and so easy to clean. Better than any burh.
"I've had this toy for a few weeks now, and my bullmastiff is still loving it. It's quite heavy and solid and I snuggle little treats in it to keep him occupied while I'm at work. I think the mfgr was expecting an entire doggie bone to go into the football, but there's no chance of that--the rubber is too hard. It stands up well to solid chewing."
My 8 mos. old son tore this apart within two weeks. It was so loud that it scared him when we first turned it on. After he was acclimated to the noise he would just bang on the flowers and chase them all over the &quot;garden&quot;. Finally one of the bands poked through and he got a hold of it. That was it's last twirl. Now it just plays music and lights up--waste of money. I get better luck with the old fashioned toys that have been around since I was a kid.
"When I lived in my old apartment I had 2 adorable ragdoll cats.I don't know if you guys ever heard of behavioural psychology or Skinner. But every time the cats would hear the food make noise, they'd jump off whereever they were resting to run to the Feeder. They would make a bee line to it. It's so adorable.Also great if your cats need a diet.Also it takes a lot of the pain out of refilling the bowl. This rations everything.Batteries last for a while.Tip"
"I really don't understand women who say they are afraid of clowns.I mean like; painted eyes, painted lips, poofed up hair...like they do look in a mirror now don't they??Stitches will leave you in stitches!!!"
This is a great game for everyone....our 5 and 2 year old love it! Perfect for kids who love to draw ~ like ours!
This is good stuff. Its better than the lotions sold at Target or Walmart. Smells like chocolate. It is solid in cold temp. but melts as soon as you put it on.
"I AM 8 AND I HAVE A VERSION 3 TAMAGOTCHI. IT IS GREAT AND MUCH BETTER THAN VERSION 2! IT HAS PASSWORDS AND YOU CAN CHOOSE MEALS AND SNACKS. ON MEAL, YOU CAN CHOOSE SCONE, SUSHI, BREAD AND CEREAL. ON SNACK, YOU CAN GET A CONE, PUDDING, TART, APPLE AND YOGURT.I HAVE A WHITE AND BLACK ONE. YOU CAN ALSO TYPE IN TAMOGOTCHI.COM AND GET LOADS OF EXTRA PASSWORDS. YOU CAN EVEN MAKE DONATIONS TO THE TAMAGOTCHI KING! THERE ARE LOTS MORE GAMES WHEN YOU CONNECT WITH ANOTHER VERSION 3 TAMOGOTCHI. YOU CAN STILL CONNECT WITH V.1 AND V.2. IT IS GREAT I LOVE IT HOPE YOU BUY IT."
"My dogs love their Cuz! We have the bad cuz with the horns. Its a little loud, but my 3 dogs wrestle over it for hours! I'm currently looking for the limited edition Halloween version. Look for the Mummy Cuz and Franken Cuz during the Halloween season!"
Was difficult to get assembled and once assembled didn't work too well. Parts were cheap flimsy plastic. Not how I remembered it when I was a child.
"We got this when my daughter was 12 months and she didn't really like it. 4 months later and now she loves it, but you definately have to sit with her and help her. If one of the sides is accidentaly pushed then it thinks you have changed pages and it's too complicated for a baby to figure out how to reset it. There is too much programming involved for a toddler and it resets itself everytime it's turned off (which is such a tempting button for a 16 month old!) It's a good toy but don't get it if you're hoping you can set them up with it and go do the laundry!"
If you want to stick to the side of your partner all day long....this is the one for you. I love the way it smells. It's so sexy and smells so good. I've always loved this scent.
I have at least 300 toys but these are my favorites. I play with them whenever I'm not eating or sleeping. I bring them to my humans to show them I want more of them. They don't have them at the local pet store anymore I was so glad you have them here. Bye
"I bought this when I adopted a 10-lb. pomeranian mix from the shelter to store his food. He only eats 1/2 cup a day, but I feed him really premium food, which is much more budget-friendly when bought in the biggest bag (of small breed kibble) they make. I was hoping by using this container, it would eventually pay for itself with the money I would save being able to keep a bigger bag of food fresh. One big bag (maybe 18 pounds?) theorteically would last him 3 months, but near the end (about 2 months in), he was less and less interested in his food--even so disinterested that he would sometimes not bother with his treat ball toys that I would put some of his food in for him to have a game to get his food. He still likes the brand of food I get because he gets so excited when I have a fresh batch, so I know his disinterest is not from boredom with the food (also, I change brands fairly often after the food is used up, with the same reaction near the end of 2 months). The food did not go bad in this container--it didn't smell bad--it just went stale, even very tightly sealed, so that it was less appetizing (and maybe less healthy since I don't know how well the nutrients fared over time).ANY food you buy, you should use within a month of opening it or it will go stale--even in a great container like this. So if you're using this container to store food, buy bags that are one month's worth of food each unless maybe you have a vacuum sealer to seal up whatever you have opened but won't use by the end of the month. (Freezing also helps.) But in that month, you can expect the food to be kept very fresh and protected in this container. I had no problem with ants, dogs, cats, or moisture getting into this container. They don't even bother with it. I just had to start buying my dog smaller bags of food--the size he could use in a month. I use this container for holding dog treats now, and I actually don't use any kind of special container now for the food because I got another, bigger dog and between the two of them, they eat one big bag (now about 27 lbs., which obviously won't fit in this size container) in about a month anyway. Maybe if I start having problems with staleness with my current method(I roll up the bags tight each time and use a bag clip), I'll get a BIG Vittles Vault--because overall it's a great product--but I won't get one sized any bigger than will hold a month's-worth of food for my dogs.Mine also came with a shallow, 1-cup food scoop that I still use. It would be better if it had markings in it that showed measurements--but if you regularly use a specific measurement less than 1 cup and don't trust yourself just eyeballing it, you can mark it yourself by measuring/pouring the proper amount of food into it with a real measuring cup and then marking a line at the top of the food.If anyone knows of a good, user-friendly, practical vacuum sealing food storage container, do let me know. I would think that would prolong food shelf life best."
"This hair dryer is a great value. It cost about $20 and dries my hair faster than my last dryer. It is lightweight, has a large, diffuser, and has actually eliminated the frizz in my bangs. Don't waste your money on a more expensive dryer."
"My wife and I love this game. It is easy to learn in about a half hour and the games generally last about an hour and up to three hours. The rule book is well illustrated, explaining the battle scenarios and game play. One battle scenario leads to the next with historical background. The little soldiers, tanks and pieces are just great. I would suggest this game if you are looking for easy to play, not very technical historical war game for the whole family."
"i'm new to the world of flat irons so I figured I should start with a highly-rated, inexpensive one. My hair is primarily straight but I have a lot of it. I've been blow drying it for years but I wanted to try getting it really straight. After reading a lot of reviews, I opted for the Andis 1"" ceramic flat iron. It's easy to use and I like the results. My only concern is the added time it takes to 1st blow dry, then flat iron my hair and the potential damage to my hair. While I don't think I'll use a flat iron every time I wash my hair, I will use it for special occasions."
I do hair for a living and this is the most amazing curling iron! It cleans very easy and makes the most amazing curls. I have 13 curling irons and this is my favorite! I reccomend it to everyone. It came in the exact time they said it would and was in perfect condition. I love it! And it comes with different temp. Settings which is idea for different types of hair!
So they sell this product in either 1.7 or 3.4. I am curious as to why this one is 3.3? They dont sell it like that anywhere else...so guess a lil confused???
"I purchased this crate in size large for a 45lbs Pit mix. Let me start off by saying the build quality is great. It is very easy and straight forward to put together. The brown is definitely darker than pictured but is very nice. I was looking for something that is more pleasing to the eye in my home and I have to say it looks really good. If my review ended here i would give it five stars.Unfortunately, I have a bit of an escape artist and two stars have to be knocked off just because its not meant for my dog. I was hesitant to make the purchase in the first place. Based on the interior of the crate having the wire crate, I felt that it would work for me and went ahead and ordered. Unfortunately the wire is spaced a bit too far apart. After a week of no problems, my dog just decided she didn't want to be in there anymore. She proceeded to tear holes through the wicker and squeeze herself out. Its amazing how small of a hole a determined dog can squeeze through. So I suppose I should have known better with my dogs track record of escaping every crate i have had so far. She is just too smart and powerful for this type of crate.If your dog is similar to mine, i advise looking for something else. If you have a less mischievous dog and your looking for a well built crate that looks great in your home then look no further. Its a fantastic crate that is well worth the money for that type of dog. If you have an escape artist in the family, then it would be better to light your money on fire because essentially that is exactly what i did!"
"I bought this for a friend of mine. Well, for her mini poodle, not her. The dog LOVES it. It makes a very deep squeak or honk and sounds hysterical. I also bought the christmas one. My friend calls them the sexy chicken toys. I also bought one that looks similar, but is wearing a pirate costume. It is made by a different company and is not good quality, too thin and easily torn apart in no time at all."
"I really wasn't happy with this straightening iron and do not find it at all worth the rather hefty sum it costs. I have long naturally wavy brown hair and was expecting better results from this flat iron that the usual ones you can pick up for about $20 at a department store. Instead, my hair was limp and lacked shine, even when accompanying the use of the iron with some hair smoothing milk. The flat iron failed to straighten some areas of my hair; there were kinks left even after using the iron for 20 minutes. I do not recommend this product."
This product is the best repair mask that I have ever used on my hair!! I am mixed half white half black and have naturally curly hair that I have relaxed since I was 14. I made the tragic mistake of having my mom put highlights in the top of my hair twiceee!!! on relaxed hair (worse thing I could have ever done !!) By the way my mom is a professional hairdresser... I have recently stopped relaxing my hair and doing any type of chemical process on it other then the brazilian blow out which I love it has brought my hair back to health and keeps the frizz tamed....... The first time I ever used this product I was amazed when I blow dryed my hair it was so soft and when I put the flat iron to it it became even softer!!! The scent of the product smells really good too I love all the oils that are in it.
Angel Eyes for Dogs is the most amazing product I have ever used. It completely removes any staining from around the eyes. Amazon.com has the best price by far. Thanks Amazon!
"I got this so I wouldn't have to carry a separate bowl when taking my dog out on hot summer days. However, it leaks all over the place. Additionally, I don't use it as intended (as shown in the photo) because the water comes out at such a slow trickle. I just unscrew the top and pour water directly into the bowl portion. I ended up super gluing the little slits in the top of the bottle closed so water would stop leaking out of it, since I don't use it as a dispenser anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would not buy this. I would just buy a sturdy collapsible bowl to carry around (Ruffwear makes good ones) in addition to a water bottle. It would only take up a little more space, would hold more water, and wouldn't leak!"
"The product's fine, however the directions show exactly how to add the pads, etc. Mine came fully assembled which means it was a used unit. It was sold to me as new and it wasn't....it was used and repackaged.....very disappointed."
"""Lucky You"" makes my daughter very happy. We went on a cruise and in packing, she put her 6.8 oz bottle that I purchased for her a few months ago, into her carry on. Needless to say when the security checkpoint asked us to step aside, we were shocked. Then, she remembered her perfume. I told her, don't worry, we'll replace it and that's what I did when we returned home.Thanks,A happy, lucky momToni"
"Since I'm a woman, it seems like any time anyone doesn't know what to get me, they resort to body sprays and lotions because all women are supposed to like those, I think. As a result of that, I have years' worth of body sprays sitting around and going bad because I just don't like them. But this one is different.This smells more like the stem and leaves of the tomato plant, so it's an earthy yet refreshing scent. I always get questions and compliments about this spray. I love that it's not flowery or fruity. It's probably not something a super girly-girl would like, but for someone who doesn't like the usual scents, this is perfect."
This leash is very well made. I feel very comfortable that it will hold up when taking our English Mastiff out for a walk.
"the product was a gift for someone who loves the stuff. the process, ordering thru amazon and having it shipped to me from macy's, was wonderfully simple and easy -- this is even better than catalog-shopping!"
"The Geotrax set is a great toy!!! We just bought the firestation and remote control firetruck for our son at Christmas. He is only 15 months old, but he loves this system!! Since Christmas, we have accumulated a large amount for his Geotrax system. We bought the Mountain Blast for him this month. This is a great addition!! Even though he is very young, he loves to push the dynamite to make the ""blast"" and he can understand how to work the remotes. He also loves to run the windmill. The Geotrax system seems to be very sturdy and durable for the younger children. It can get to be an expensive hobby. There are many more additions that we plan on getting him. The only draw back to that is finding room to store it all when it isn't being played with. Unfortunately, we do not have room to build it and leave it up all of the time, so we build him a small track to keep in his room all of the time and then we build the big layouts for him on the weekends. I love the fact that these additions do not have a bunch of little pieces that come apart, but it does present a problem as far as storage. There are a few things that they could do differently to make this set even better. The trains need to have 2 different speeds and go in reverse. That would make it alot more fun to play with. You will definetly need to invest in rechargeable batteries!!!!! You will go broke trying to replace regular batteries, they die out pretty fast. The rechargeables are more expensive to start, but they definetly pay off in the end. I would recommend this set to anyone with little kids - girls or boys. I have 10 year old twin girls that love to ""help"" their little brother play with his Geotrax. I think they have more fun with it than he does. It is a great toy for everyone in the family."
It worked pretty good for the first month and then it stopped spraying each time my labador would bark..
Had looked high and low for several years hoping to find my second Conair Curling Combo. The one I have is a decade old and slowly wearing down. The new one offers a brush attachment which is great for using on the top and sides and the larger one is just right for the back. My only complaint is that the cord is noticeably shorter on the new one.
"I read the reviews on here and decided to wait until we'd had this litter box a while before commenting. We've had the regular (not deluxe) Scoop Maid for 6 months now. It has worked out really well for us. Before getting this litter box, we'd tried the conventional litter boxes and the self-cleaning type that you roll back and forth. We had problems with odors with both, but the biggest problem was that no one wanted to deal with the mess.We own 1 cat who is about to turn 6 years old. He weighs 13-14 pounds and eats Purina One. We change out the cartridge about once every 4 weeks. The box works just as the video instructions on amazon demonstrates. We just remove the cartridge and place it in the trash can outside without any mess. Very convenient.The criticisms I do have (why the product doesn't get 5 stars from me) is the cost. I paid around $95 for the regular one, and I think that price is a bit high for the product. In addition, there is only ONE place in my town where I have been able to find the refills. They charge $15.99 per cartridge, and $45.99 for a pack of 3 (a $2.00 savings). Since that's the only store that carries the refills in my town, I have to make sure to keep one cartridge on hand at all times so that I don't ever need a refill when the store is out of stock."
"I have tried many self tanners and this is the best I have found. It gives you a nice natural glow, doesn't smell, and doesn't come off on your clothes. I love it."
"My sister (with yellow-blond hair) loved this product, so I tried it expecting the same. I have ashy blonde-brown hair. It bleached my hair into this awful shade of orange-red. Terrible! There should be a warning on it! I'll be complaining to clairol."
"This item broke almost immediately. It leaked water and the pump was loud and distracting. It's unfortunate, since the idea of fresh water for our pets was a very attractive idea, but I went back to the good ol' water bowl after this waste of money."
"We bought this potty as our 1st try. First of all it is extremely difficult to empty, you have to completely take it apart to empty the pot. Not to mention pee gets into every nook and cranny.....the whole inside is hollow and full of these squares that you can't possibly clean in less you soak it in hot soapy water. Just a pain!! The opening is smaller than most and completly flat. Very difficult to use. We bought the graco soft seat potty. What a HUGE difference!!!!"
"We have a new dog that we adopted from the shelter, and she loves to chew on EVERYTHING. When I got this in the mail, she was so excited, she took it in her mouth and ran in the other room to chew. She loves this and it keeps her (somewhat) from chewing on the furniture, etc. Just make sure and pick it up before heading to bed at night - I've stepped on it in the dark - ouch! LOL"
"We purchased our first food ball over a couple years ago and we now have four. We're extremely happy with them! We purchased these because we have two cats, both indoors, and we felt like they needed some additional stimulation during the day, plus both of our cats would eat way too fast when we would feed them from a bowl (sometimes resulting in piles of vomit throughout the house - not cool). It didn't take long for our cats to figure these balls out - I just rolled it around in front of them to show them how and they got it right away. These work perfectly for what we needed them for. These food balls have held up very well. We have all four colors, but for some reason our cats prefer the pink and orange balls - those are always the ones that end up empty first (not sure why), though they will eat from the green and blue ones when the pink and orange are empty. The only caveat with these is that they are not the easiest things to clean, but I haven't really had to clean them since the first cleaning I gave them after I purchased them. Highly recommend these!"
"This Little People Toy is Great and So Much Fun!!!!! I bought it for Christmas for My Nephew and my sister tells me he Loves it!!!!! He Loves to hear the Sounds, and put the Firefighter to Bed and the down the Drop Hole to his Truck! He also has learned from it! Just a Great Toy and a Great Gift to anyone!! I Highly Reccommend it!!!!!! Great Job Fisher Price!"
"I had my hair styled at a salon before a night at the ballet. My hair is very strait & never holds a curl, but the stylist used this and it worked magic! It even had curls the next morning! So i splurged & spent $120 on this iron and i am so dissapointed. It dosnt have a clamp to hold hair in place while curling, so you have to find a way to hold it yourself. Even with the heat glove i purchased with it, i have managed to burn my arm everytime i pick it up. And its very hard to use. I am now looking for another curling iron :-("
"I was just now setting up this stupid game I got for my 9-yr-old son who asked for it. There are at LEAST 9 spots to land where you're supposed to sue your neighbor and get 100,000. I have a real problem with that. Another is where you get cosmetic surgery...what? I came online to see what alternatives I could come up with and make my own stickers to put over top of the extra bad spots. Definately should have read the reviews. I didn't have this one as a kid, but I can't immagine it being like this."
POSITIVE
"I read the reviews for this and wasn't sure what to expect, but for under $5 it was worth the risk. We have two kittens and it is hilarious to watch them chase the laser around the room and up the walls. Like any toy, they will get bored so using it for short periods of time and then letting it disappear for a while works best. Of the 5 images that can be produced, the dot is the brightest and seems to be the most intriguing for the cats. The smiley face, mouse, butterfly and star are more interesting to the owners than they are to the cats...the cats just want to chase a bright light around and these images are not as precise or bright so they seem to be less fun to chase. If you buy it and your cats don't like it, it makes a great laser pointer for presentations (if you do them)!"
I have owned an Andis hair dryer before and loved it- I had to leave it when I sold my home. I quickly ordered a new one for my present home (a slightly upgraded version) and am extremely pleased. It is very quiet and the nightlight is very useful during the night. I would highly recommend this dryer.
"I have used this product for years. Amazon is the only place I could find it this time, so I bought extra. I use the real J'adore and this smells just like it and lasts a long time on your pet."
"I have five cats that range in ages from 3 years to 15 years old. This toy is enjoyed by all. My 15 year old is lazy and had not played in years with ANY toy other than the Turbo Scratcher. She is obsessed with the Cat Charmer as are all my cats.The Cat Charmer is an attractive well made toy. The stick part is a clear strong but slightly flexible plastic.The ""ribbon"" part is a four foot long narrow strip of a stretchy polar fleece type of material. It does sometimes get snagged on the cats claws. However a flick of your wrist and it comes undone.One of the best things about this toy is that you don't have to move around too much to entertain the cat with it because the ""ribbon"" is so long. Also it's a quiet toy.Overall, I think this would be a great toy to add to your cats toy collection!"
"To be honest, I do not own a huge dog (my pup is only 10 pounds)...so why did I get the huge bed? I have a good, old-fashioned bamboo mama-san (bowl)chair that I have not been able to part with. However, the cushions get well worn and can be lumpy or simply not in colors that I would like. I decided to try the largest size dog bed and it is a PERFECT fit! It is far superior in cushioning and so comfy that my family fights over who gets to sit in the chair. We even bought a second one and now have one as a floor cushion for lounging on. These are HIGH quality, well-made and come in fabrics that match my furniture, so they are WELL worth purchasing...EVEN if you have a BIG DOG that is going to use it instead of a big kid!"
"My daughter recieved this toy when she was about 1 1/2 years old. She is now 3 1/2 and still plays with Noah's Ark. We bought a lot of the Little People toys, and this was her favorite. In fact, we have handed down most of her LP playsets to younger cousins, but she threw a fit to keep the ark. The extra animal sets are also really great and worth the money!"
I purchased this for my granddaughter's 1st birthday. This was the gift that she took to bed with her that night! She just loved it. I just purchased another one for my grandson who is 8 months old because I couldn't wait until his 1st birthday to give him one!
I bought the same product at another site and unfortunately the item was a fake. Bacause of that bad experience I wasn't sure of making this transaction on Amazon but I did and this time the perfum was original. Thank's Amazon for being a honest seller.
"I got this game as a gift from a friend... and I enjoy it sooo much!!! It's a pretty good ""boardgame simulation"" of an aerial battle. It's alot of fun...and it isn't too short or too long to play. You can play it over and over again and it's still fun. I suggest this game for anyone who wants to have a good time...whether it be a rainy day inside... or a sunny day sipping lemonade outside."
"My 6 yr old went crazy when she saw these in the store. We bought all 4 of them and they were opened before we got in the door. Much to her dislike, her 23 month old brother liked them just as much. They do have little parts but the turtles themselves, without the small stuff, work great for both of my kids."
I bought this for my new puppy (9 weeks old) and she really loves it. Thumbs up on this one.
"Though I knew this was an 18"" figure, I was still surprised at how massive it is-and heavy. I recently bought two, one to display and the other to sell somewhere down the line...yes, I'm a geek... Regardless, for collectors like me, this figure is definately worth the price. The detail is immaculate down to the actual bullets in Hellboy's ""Good Samaritan."" I love how the figure is also wearing stitched clothing which gives it a more textured appearance. The gun is a little hard to squeeze into Hellboy's hand, but there is a holster on his belt that serves as a temporary sanctuary. The tail is a bendy, so you don't have to worry about it getting in the way as you pose it on your bookshelf. Speaking of posing, the figure can be easily placed in an upright position without it falling over. The one gripe I have is the packaging. It took me ten minutes to untie all the twisties which was a royal pain. All in all, you don't have to be a Hellboy fan to appreciate the artistry of this figure."
Other Customer reviews helped me buy this for my wife and she is very pleased! I Think if you want an inexpensive Hair Dryer That acts like an expensive one than this is a good try! Although the test of time is still out as it was a recent purchase. We are pleased!
"I got this for my squirrel-chasing, bicycle-lunging, pulling-towards-dogs dog, after he choked himself on a regular collar once so hard he threw up.He is a polite walker now. No more pulling. He eagerly noses into it when I pull it out. It did take a couple of sudden backflips for him to learn that this harness won't put up with that kind of behavior. The leash attaches to the front, so a sudden lunge will pull him around right quick, often flipping him over. A heavier dog might not be as resilient to this as my 40-lb pup.It doesn't fit quite as the instructions intend, since it creeps up over his shoulderblades instead of sitting behind them, but it does the job anyway. And it might not be ideal for shorter dogs, as the lower attachment point does result in more leg tangles. I even taught my dog to lift the foot I point to on command to make untangling easier.It also makes a handy handle to hold him by that is easier on him than the collar."
"We adopted a bichon a few years ago from a rescue shelter. He was a mess with brown spots all around his mouth and eyes After using angel eyes according to their instructions, all the brown has disappeared and he has stayed without the staining for over a year. I've since reordered it to help with his hot spots and it appears to have helped with that too.It's an amazing product and would strongly recommend it."
"We received the Oceans Wonders Aquarium and used it from birth to 9 months then received the Slumbertime Gloworm as a Christmas gift. We have both ont the crib. The Ocean Wonders Aquarium works great &amp; I would recommend it. However along with our son, we like the Slumbertime better. It seems to help more when he's fussy and doesn't want to go down for a nap. The little bears on the sides really grab his attention and distract him from being upset when they are activated. Sometimes when it's quiet in his room I'll peek in and there he is sitting up watching it like he's watching television, then before long he's off to sleep. If fact, I'm purchasing three more today, so he goes down a little easier when visiting his Grandparents and Aunt. I would highly recommend both monitors, but if I did it all over again I would purchase the Slumbertime over the Ocean Wonders Aquarium. Reason being"
"my hair is falling too much,I will stop using this product.I will try loreal professional scalp scurb product.The hair brush and the mixing cup is uesful."
the game's so good i bought 5!
"It can squeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaak for a really long time. My dogs love it, though occasionally we put it on a high shelf for ""quiet time"". Its great for a good play session outside!It's not meant to be chewed on unsupervised, it's not a chewie. It had many, many hours of rough play before the felt eventually tore, but it had a good duration. Great value for the price, so I just ordered another."
"Not five minutes after getting the Snoozer II out of the box my chihuahua knew it was for him. Now he is sleeping comfortably with plenty of room to lay down. He is 12 lbs, bigger than the average chihuahua. I haven't used in my car yet. I noticed though that the strap to clip your dog in isn't attached to the seat, I think it goes through the seatbelt when you put it in."
My nephew loves this toy. He runs around for hours. It is noisy but it is worth putting up with the noise to see the smile on his face.Oh! and it only pops on carpet and not hard floors. That's the only complaint.
This is a great game. I bought it for my 4 year old daughter and she loves it. Her 3 year old sister also likes to play it. My oldest daughter has learned alot about different animals and there habitats. Very educational and fun at the same time.
"My 18 mo. son liked this toy very much, he is now 25 mos. and he has outgrown it, he still plays with it sometimes. It entertains him for 5 minutes at a time. The colors and music are fun, the woman's voice gets annoying after some time but then again, the toy is not for me. It's been through war and still works great. It has numbers, letters and songs to choose from and the spanish feature has taught my 5 year old some spanish."
"My 3 1/2 yr old granddaughter wanted an 'airplane' for Christmas (grandpa's a pilot). After a fair amount of shopping around, this looked like a good bet. I think it is. Toy is made from appears to be pretty durable plastic parts. Top of the fuselage comes off, allowing child to play with pilot and Texas oilman passenger in airplane. One note of caution"
Excellent product for the treatment of bruises. Bruises get lighter with the treatment and go away much faster too. Try it and see>
My Girlfriend had gotten me this cologne while she was in Europe and i had never been a big fan of cologne. I am now.A scent is hard to describe but I'll do my best. Its sweet smelling but at the same time has a lighter smell. Either way You need to smell this for yourself it's amazing.The bottle design is very trendy looking and many people had to ask what it was.All in all i'm a very big fan of this scent.Since getting this i have become i big fan of Hugo Boss
"This comb is sturdy and will last, and is simply built. My cat LOVES it. By far his favorite comb - this is the only one I'm recommending from now on."
"I was so hopeful this was going to work after reading all the other reviews. Our 3-year old bites her fingernails and toenails until they bleed and we are worried about her health. We applied this liberally and every day (despite the claim that the product should be applied every other day), but she would pick it off and kept on biting. We're hopeful we'll find something that works, but this didn't do it for us."
"So someone else says that this toy is inappropriate for children. Good, I'm very proud of you. Just like the TV series, these toys are not meant for kids. Maybe if you had a sense of humor you'd get a kick out of these funny items like most rational people can."
"Euphoria by CK. The fragrance of this perfume is truly euphoric! A mix of Pomegranate, Black Orchid, Lotus Blossom, and Liquid Amber, this fragrance turns woody as the day passes. I've got compliments during the day whenever I am wearing this perfume.The fragrance is confident and sexy. A must have!"
"The cats go wild for Greenies, but then they like bugs too. Seriously, these are good. I just wish they would chew them so they could get the dental benefits, instead of inhaling them."
"The first thing our male cat did was remove it from it's hanger and flip it upside-down. He's such a glutton that food in a dish takes too long for him to eat, so he knocks it out. We cleaned it and refilled it with water, which he's learned not to flip. I do like how easy it is to install, so that you can position/reposition it at whatever height works best for your pet."
"Frontline purchased through Amazon is half the price of what the vet charges so I was able to buy a larger quantity at once. Same product, half the price; it's a win-win! And, the product works to help keep the ticks off our cat so we're all more comfortable."
"I got some of this in a sampler and started wearing it to rave reviews! So even though this is intended for men, it seems to be a good frangrance for women too. I also think it has a bit of a flowery smell, like one of the other reviewers, so I can see how some men might not like it! Perhaps this is really a unisex scent."
"Why run with the crowd?If you wear cologne and you're interested in something REALLY different, an Annick Goutal eau de toilette may be just what you are looking for. They are not cheap, but a little bit goes a long way, and it is unlikely that you'll smell like anybody else in the neighborhood.I have worn Goutal's Eau D'Hadrien as my ""signature scent"" for more than 10 years. It has a bright, woodsy, citrus scent and while Goutal recommends it for ""evening wear,"" I think it's appropriate for daily use. That's not necessarily true of Mandragore.Mandragore is a very ""dark"" scent. Goutal says that's the smell of the mandrake root. I'll take their word for it since I have no idea what mandrake smells like. But be that as it may.... Mandragore is a very dark, rich, almost ""chocolaty"" scent. Eau D'Hadrien is dashing; Mandragore is elegant. It reminds me of dark wood, leather and old country homes that I couldn't possibly afford, (not in this life time anyway). If you're in the habit of ""splashing on"" your cologne, you're going to use way too much. I think it's too bold for daily wear. But on that special night when you want to impress that special someone, Mandragore will transform you into the Dark Knight - a man of mystery. The rest is up to you."
"I love hearing, ""Wow, you look great. Are you doing something different?"" Yes, I am. NuFace is my secret. I use this little gadget every morning and every night religiously. My skin looks much firmer. My jaw line is much, much more defined. I just hope I don't wear it completely out. After all, I've been using it twice a day for about 6 weeks. I'm 52 and my skin looks great.I have a nice rosy complexion. Thank you, NuFace! And, by the way, I am a real customer. I have no affiliation with NuFace. Wish I worked for NuFace so I could get a discount. All I can say is...love it, love it, love it!"
"Have used this type of straighter since I've been 15, now 23. Even out of the other top brands, this still exceeds. Top stylists in the area agreed. I recommend."
"The base of the product is not that sturdy....I tried to fit it with the help of a screw but it didn't help. However, after putting it on patio floor, didn't notice any issues.The seller should have checked the product before shipping."
"This deck has some great cards. For example, it has the usual cards like Monster Reborn and Dark Hole, but, as you all know, those are limited to ONE per deck. And, it has the card i've been wanting for a LONG time...Polymerization. It has the Fusion card and Materials for Thousand Dragon and Flame Swordsman, and it has Red-Eyes Black Dragon, a great card. And Penguin Soldier has a rather ""annoying"" effect on your opponent"
"Having several very young grandchildren I purchased a lot of the Leapfrog toys for Christmas--this ball is great. Colorful, durable, educational and most important -- its fun. Well worth the money and another winner from Leapfrog."
"I like this product, i think it makes my skin better. when i apply it, my skin absorbs it quickly.thanks"
"My son received this for Christmas and liked it even though he was only 5 months old at the time. We'd sit him by it and put the balls down and he'd watch and smile. Now at 9 months old, he's standing and will repeatedly put the balls down the holes for 20-30 minutes at a time. He also likes to just push the little buttons to make the noise. It helped him when he was learning to stand up and was very stable for him."
WORKS VERY WELL AND YOUR DOGS COAT FEELS NICE AND SILKY SMOOTH AND TANGLE FREE WHEN USED AFTER SHAMPOOING. VERY HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT.
"This won best perfume at the FiFi Awards (Fragrance Foundation). I have been wanting to buy it, and when I saw that it was such a good price (better than Sephora or Duty Free sales at the airport), I went ahead and purchased it."
"I have wavey to lightly curly hair. I straightened only my bangs with the product because basically I like my curls, just not on my bangs, where they have always bothered me, especially in the summer when swimming or exercising in humid climates.After reading the reviews, I was a little apprehensive and sceptical about what I could expect. However, I used the product on my color-treated hair, and the result was just what I had hoped for"
My French Bulldog LOVES this bed warmer! She gets very chilly in the winter and usually sits on top of the heater vent all day. With her new bed warmer she lounges happily in bed until her ears turn bright pink from the heat. She's in heaven!
We used to play this game when I was a child and it is fun to have it again and to play it with my children. I am happy I found it on Amazon.com
"Our 17 lb. pug, Desmond, can go through a bed in no time what so ever, but then we ordered this item (24 inch version). He absolutely loves it. He plays with it, sprawls in it, actually wears it (if you don't believe me there is a youtube video of this by searching ""Desmond the pug"", he also carries it to where ever he wants to sleep. It has only gotten one tear in it, which was in the one spot he would lay in it and chew. It was easily sewn and we have not had any problem with it since. Have no fear in purchasing this bed."
"I bought this for my age 6 son for his birthday. The first one we received was defective, as the sound directions were absent. Amazon replaced it right away - fantastic customer service. The new one works well. Both my son and daughter enjoy playing with it, and I am amazed how well it has helped my 4-year old daughter learn her alphabet letters. I agree with another reviewer that it would be helpful if the toy would tell the child when he/she has not actually spelled a word. In some of the activities I know my son has believed himself to have spelled a word, when it wasn't. The graphics could perhaps be a little more imaginative in some ways, but the kids like them, the toy has provided good practice, and I do think the ""silent e"" presentation is very memorable to little ones."
"My sister was very happy with this perfume, which I bought for her on Mother's Day. It has a fresh scent and the price was really good. Thanks."
"This game is great fun for those who are playing. However, once you get voted off the ""island"" there isn't anything to do until the final tribal council so your guests will need something to do until that time. Best if played with the maximum number of people possible. If you've ever seen the TV show, then you know what it's all about. There are brain teasers and pictionary elements to this game. But the most fun is that you get to vote players out of the game! You get small dry-wipe cards so you can secretly write who you want to vote off the island! Cool game board and sure to ignite lots of conversation! This is fun to see who will stand by you til the end. I had a lot of fun with my friends and family battling til the end, until I got kicked off!!"
I had so much fun playing this game as a child I gave it to my best friends famiy for Saturday night game night with the family. Everyone just enjoys it. Can't go wrong buying this for your family or giving it as a gift. It's also a great way to get the family away from the electronics and to actually think with their brains .... lol.
"I have been an avid Axis & Allies player for over ten years, and was eagerly looking forward to this game's arrival on the shelves. Sadly, I was very disappointed. It is very clear to me that not only did the game designers not properly play-test this game, they also didn't read their history texts.First of all, the game allows the impossible"
"My boxer decided one day to start jumping on our leather couch. He is 3 years old and this never happened before. We used our kitchen chairs to block him, and somehow he'd squeeze between and still be standing on the couch when we were home from work. Not only that, but he'd toss my beautiful pillows on the floor and destroy them as he ""made his comfy couch bed.""I purchased 3 X mats one for each couch cushion and he has NOT eaten one pillow or been on the couch sense. They are working in our household. We are very happy with this product and have been using them for over a month with success."
I purchased this for an aging cat. He slept on it one time and then decided he didn't like it. I then used it as a foot warmer. My small dogs also enjoy it.
The kibble we use is pretty small so we had to adjust the holes so that only a few pieces would dribble out at a time. This involved duct tape. Even then it did not interest our cats in the least... which is surprising because the both love to eat. They did little more than sniff or back away from it if it was rolled to them. After a week we threw it out because it was just making a mess on the floor.
"McFarlane finally gets the license for the greatest sci-fi alien warrior ever and they cheap out on it! There were TWO movies, why give us the same figure twice?this figure comes with a closed face and a removable mask, it also has the throwing disc (which fits into the figures hand), and a removable/battle damage arm (yeah i know the predator loses his had to danny glover in the movie but this is THE WORST MCFARLANE ACCESORY EVER. what is this he-man? we dont want battle damage, give us more cool predator weapons!)the ""Hunter Predator"" figure is basically the same figure but this time it has an open face and no mask. it comes with a cool spear that the figure can hold, and it comes with the same throwing disc that the other figure comes with (real original here) and this time the figure cant even hold it in his hand.Come on... where are all the cool different predator weapons? every predator has a different body suit. why make two of the same? nice figures but they need work! give this movie line some respect lets see more predators!"
"this is my third set of rollers from caruso. bought first one almost 20 yrs. ago when it was first invented. love it doesn't damage hair, works fast. curls last a long time."
I give this game to my hubby on christmas...and he loved it!!!if you are a gamers this one is a must have to add to your collections.
"Its not very big , and i am really not to impressed with it. We will see come Christmas morning how my 4 year old likes it."
"I was very happy to find a collar that would be comfortable for my cat and not too bulky- so when I read the review about it not being safe I was concerned. I had to see for myself so I ordered it. The portion of the collar that allows for sizing has two strands of nylon and when only one is pulled the collar actually EXPANDS! So if your cat is wearing it at a comfortable size and this part is tugged, even if the breakaway magnet does not open, you cat will be able to squeeze out of the now larger collar. And the breakaway magnet works well...it takes a good firm tug for it to open up. When I first got it I gave it a tug and it needed a lot of force to open up but that was just the first time, it was more responsive after that.This is a clever minimalistic collar- and it is safe!"
"Since I rent, I couldn't put a hole in anything. This was the perfect solution. Some people have mentioned that the weather stripping was inadequate, and I can understand that. I bought some additional stripping myself, but what came with it was decent quality. Much will depend on where you live.I don't have to mess with litter boxes anymore, and my cat is very happy."
"I got this from a friend last X'mas, and my son loves it. It's easy to play with, educational and fun. He could easily roll the ball in the stand, and it sings while rolling. There are 3 modes"
So sad that they change this product! I loved the old formula it never made my hair look or feel crunchy. The new formula does!!!!! I am so disappointed that I no longer have my go to hair product.
I bought this doll house for my two grand daughters who are a year and a half. It is just the right size with just enough objects in it to amuse them. There are several sound features that they also enjoy. It is constructed very well.
"I have worn this product since it was first introduced-after 23 years, I still have people ask me what fragrance it is, and how wonderful it smells. I rate Obsession as my favorite cologne...I even buy bottles in advance in the fear that at some time it will no longer be available."
"I have dry / combination skin.When I 1st used this I got small, irritating bumps that were the same color as my skin. I thought that my skin was just breaking out so I was sure to pamper it with thorough cleansing and continued to use this about 2-3 more times and each time I saw more of the suspicious bumps appear. They didn't look like acne to me, they looked like my skin was having a allergic reaction to something I put on it and the pharmacist at CVS agreed with that notion. I stopped using this and kept treating my skin with the addition of topical cortisone and a oral anti-histamine to my routine. That same day the irritating feeling and bumps slowly but surely started to go away. With in I'd say 3-4 days the bumps were completely gone! Fast forward about 1 month later silly me wanted to be SURE this was what caused my reaction (and not a cheaper detergent I started using around the same time I initially broke out) so 2 days ago I smeared some more of this stuff on and when I woke up the next morning...whoomp there they were, more of the same small, iritating bumps. I have never had a problem with beta hhydroxy acid and wanted to like this product but my skin just won't accept it."
I did not like this product at all. Too sticky and tacky. It stuck to everything I wore to bed. It also had a gritty texture to it. I do not plan on buying this product again. The Mama Mio Tummy butter is much better.
"I really like this figure. The detail is very good. The Andruil sword is neat. The blade has runes running from the top to the bottom. He looks very kingly. His cape is inserted into the back of the figure,It comes out kind of easily but he looks neat with or without it."""
The instructions were not very clear but I finally figured out how to remove the cover to load it. The design is ok but the feeder started malfunctioning after only 3 times used. It began continually running and wouldn't stop. This probably explains why the battery was almost run down after the second time I used it. I would be willing to try another one if Amazon will replace it.
We had one of these for our Jack Russell (Rustam) and our Aussi Cattle dog (Paro) would wait for him to step out at night and get in it to go to sleep. This made Rustam come to our bed. Today night we had 2 crates and we all slept happily. I like that this crate has 3 doors in case we want to move them around there are many possibilities. I like the fact that we can remove the doors so we are not hitting it or knocking then shut. We don't lock the crates till we have someone who is really scared of dogs over or are using the vacuum cleaner the crate works fine for both the situations to hold them in. But then our dogs don't try to breakout.
I have 5 dogs (both small and large) and didn't know if this would work on any or all of them. I can tell you this is a miracle worker on all the dogs. Some of them will still try barking while wearing it but only one or two times and the barking stops. The others won't even try to bark with it on. The only buyers remorse I've had with this product is that I didn't get it years ago. Great product.
"I used this when I dyed my hair lighter blonde then natural. So I wanted to darken it up. Used this, and It turned out a little darker then medium brown, but still I think it looks good. Once it fades it will look more natural.For the price of how cheep this is, I would say it is a good deal."
"I bought this online and immediately sent it back. IT looks ugly, needs set up and screwing and overall nothing that makes a child be interested in it. I then bought the Disney's little einsteins car that has the handle and seating and all other fun songs and equipment that helps the child interact. don't bother with this toy"
"Product is wonderful for mornings I don't have time to wash my hair (because I hit the snooze button!) Best advice is to shake it, hold can about 6 inches away from hair, hold hair up so spray gets to roots. Don't touch your hair even if it it standing up and looks gray. Let it dry about a minute of so and then style. Smell is not bad, I ordered the tropical scent. I loved it."
I am really upset regarding this product. I bought it a month ago specifically for my Presidents Day long weekend vacation. I have been gone 4 days and this thing is opened in between 2 food trays and my 4 month old kitten is upset because he is hungry. Cheaply made and do not waste your money.
"Simple game ,my son 3 and my daughter 5 love to play this game!Snails are cute and colorful,well made !Good game for teaching colors,taking turnes,not too long to play,keep kids interested for longer time!I like to play with them!"
this is probably one of the best board games around by the actual rules its a lot of fun but this game also makes it easy to make your own house rules. my family trades in cards differently because it makes no sence to control only 1 territory and get 55 armies just because you trade in a card set but this game allows you to intergrate your own rules seamlessly this game is great
"My 5-year-old son just received this for his birthday and we both just love it. It is very hard to use with the stylus because you cannot see what you are making, therefore the toy has a hard time recognizing your letters, but if used with the included paper and a #2 pencil, it is very easy. It tells you how to write a letter and if you write it correctly, it rewards you by making your letter dance. This toy also teaches lower case letters, the ABC song and small words...very neat toy...just don't use that stylus, which I am not sure why Vtech even included with the toy. P.S.You can download all the pages on Vtech's website as well!"
"My vet said this is a very good product to be giving my 13 year old girl. She's in awesome shape, but I give her this because I can tell she slowing down in her older age."
I rate this as a good toy overall because I have only found one thing with it I don't like...the motor is a little noisey..I had read other reviews on this toy saying the same thing..my daughter just turned 1 on Nov. 22 and she got this for a gift..she loved it from the moment we brought it into her sight..She loves to stand at it and knock the blocks off of it over and over again..she has probably over 50 blocks now and beleive it or not it holds everyone of them....good storage too..they all are in one spot for easy access for her..I give it five stars for fun because I even like getting down and playing with her..Educational value is great too because they learn to stack the blocks good eye hand cordination skills are learned through this...Durability is a five because my daughter loves to climb..she is a bit on the small size in weight but she has been walking and climbing on things since she was 10 1/2 months old and she can't seem to destroy this toy yet...I would buy this for any friend who had a child.
This is a great pet waterer. It holds 3 gallons of water - the down side is that it is heavy when it is filled to capacity.
"Vet recommended using to treat kidney disease progression. Added to food at twice daily feedings gave impressive improvement in creatinine (sp?) levels after 3 months use. No longer having to administer additional fluids, dog is more active, and the bright eyes are back!"
My favorite perfume. Always get compliments on the perfume when I use it. People always ask what perfume I have on.
"I misunderstood the dimensions listed ( 7.5 x 1.5 x 10.5 inches ) and thought it would be large enough for my mother to see and handle. It isn't. Apparently, the dimensions include the packaging. She loves Wheel Of Fortune on TV, and I thought this game would be terrific therapy for her hands. Very disappointing. I'll be returning it, unopened."
"High quality toy that my kids love. They've been playing with it since I first gave it to them around age 9 months. They play with it in different ways as they get older. Looks fantastic, and it's smooth and well made. It's definitely smaller than the plastic stacking rings, but I think appropriately sized for a baby."
I bought this game before going on a cruise with my boyfriend so that we would have something to do on quiet days. We played so much and really had a lot of fun with it. It's part strategy and luck and it's almost stressful at times! I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a 2-player game!
"Having 3 children ages 16,14 & 10, its fun for all ages and adults too. The only comment the kids said was they wish it had a grid that would keep the tiles in place. I believe that is available in a more deluxe model but we got the basic game. Overall its a great game to have in your collection."
"I've used Kneipp products for years and this is a staple in my bath cabinet for cold & flu season. Since the baby cold medicine has been recalled for the last few years, I've used this for my children when they are stuffy with chest & head colds. It offers them a little relief and helps ease their breathing. I use it for myself as well, and find it works better than cold tablets to ease congestion, but you can't stay in the bath forever- sigh! I recommend this to all my mom friends & they have each told me how it helps their kiddos when they are sick."
"I love this stuff. My DOG loves this stuff. I don't use it as a food but as a training aid. They are strong-smelling enough to be effective, I take the entire roll and cut the whole thing up into little cubes (about 1CM). I put a handfuls into seperate baggies, saving one to train immediately then freeze the rest. As soon as one baggie is empty, I move another bag from the freezer to the fridge to defrost. My dog is now trained but still gets these as a treat. Now we have a puppy and he is motivated to learn quickly with these!"
Product works great! I would highly recommend it! Best price I found was on Amazon.
"Gave to our grandson and he was all smiles. While he is still very young, he will have many months of play. The beauty of this gift, is it can change as he grows."
"WOW! My younger brothers got this quite a few years ago, and the older version has different colors, but is exactly the same otherwise. This toy is amazingly fun! The chair and computer console, and the tank, all come off easily, so that was frustrating, but otherwise, all was great!My brothers, as avid Batman fans and collectors, had a blast dropping Robin from the fall-in ""glass"" ceiling on the front of the mansion. The computer and it's chair are especially fun to play with. What seems to fuel a lot of imagination is the closet next to the computer screens. It can be rotated so that you put Batman in, turn it, and open the door to see Batman GONE! Whoa, right? The entire mansion itself can be collapsed, which is nice for travel to Grandma's or to the living room.This toy supplies lots of fun, whether you like Batman or not!"
Works as advertised and I am planning to purchase another one for our camp trailer. The only thing is I would recommend a quality clumping litter.
They shipped super fast. The cards are thin enough to shuffle like regular cards and yet they are durable. I was looking for something to take camping; these work great because if they get dirty you can just rinse them off. And they glow in the dark- what more could you ask for?
"This lotion was very nice -- it soaked in quickly and didn't leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky. It does have a slight perfumed fragrance, which may be annoying to those who prefer unscented products. I like Ahava, but it's a bit expensive for a daily body lotion."
"We purchased this cat box thinking that it would be best for keeping the dogs out of it. They had always gotten into the ones with the flap doors and we have big dogs so the top entrance ones wouldn't help either. I saw this and thought it would be perfect. Unfortunately it doesn't latch like EVERY OTHER CAT BOX EVER. No, the top dome just kinda sit on top. If you have very active cats, they can even knock off the cover. It was a pain to move around too. it's not even bigger than a normal cat box, just takes up more room because of the stairs. It's also harder to clean out. Liners don't fit properly and it's curved inside so it can be difficult to clean the edges. All in all, not a smart product."
This is a great item! Baby Tad is awesome. All children love Baby Tad. I even love Baby Tad!
"This is not a game. Some people have trouble geting it to work(i no i did!). First read directions and then take it out of the box. Place your (works best with a friend first time)fingers on it not to hard and not to light.clear your mind and ask it a question and it might not work.the best thing to ask it is ""are there any spirits in here?""and that might work.some times u have to say ""ouija board are there any spirits in here"" and that should do it. This game is not fake it is very real and should not be ured by any one under the age of 11. i gave all five stars in every thing because it is the best game ever made in this world!!!"
"My daughter received this toy for her 1st birthday. The trunk and other little extras are fun, but she can't make it move when she sits on it. Her feet hit the back end because it is so wide. It didn't help her as a walk behind, either, because the handle is low and forward of her feet -- she'd end up leaning over her toes. She also has the Little Tykes Speed Racer and she LOVES it - at about the same price, it's a much better choice."
"My daughter is 4 months old and absolutely loves this toy. It has so many activities that it keeps her busy laughing and playing for quite a while. Not only does she love it, but I sometimes have to tell my 3 year old to give it back because she loves the mirror in the belly."
I bought these for my 7 year old nephew for Christmas and he immediately put them on and wanted to shut all of the lights off. He has been using them for almost a year and still uses them. It's rare for a toy to hold his interest that long. They are great for pretend play.
"I have a difficult time getting this scent on occasion b/c it isn't always sold in an area where I am, but I LOVE this scent! I get compliments EVERY time I wear it"
"I LOOOVE this fragrence. I want to wear it all the time, even around the house. I'm not an old lady and I don't think it's 'old lady-ish' as some might think. It's WOOONDERFUL! Smells like a real rose."
"I have a large white dog and have tried many different dog brushes. This one works better than any I have ever used. Silly expensive, but works great."
"I've purchased every Ring related game except for the Fantasy Flight series. With that being said my favorite (and the best) is the long out of print SPI title ""War of the Ring"" to which the current title under review owes a great deal of it's appeal and design. This is a strategic level WAR game, centering on the military aspects of war in the LOTR, while incorporating the familiar characters we've come to love or dread. This is not a product for celebrating your 7 years birthday child whose hero is Frodo. It is a mature game requiring patience, intelligence and at least some measure of strategy and tactics. Your [...] will certainly enjoy the plastic figurines (I enjoy them as well and when no one is looking I'll play toy soldiers with them!). Set aside an entire evening or maybe even 2 evenings to play the game thru to completion . The expansion set (which I review elsewhere) brings the same qualities but to the tactical level. A younger person might relate to that better since it incorporates the battle sequences familiar from the movies. I rate it 5 stars but keep in mind it is not a ""fun for the whole family"" nor a ""thrill packed adventurous journey in Middle Earth"". It's a war game first and foremost. But man, those plastic figures are super cool any way you see it!"
"I've found this hair dryer to meet my needs drying my longer hair, and it's a much appreciated lighter weight than my last one. However, I do wish it was a little quieter on high speed, or else have a medium speed setting to select."
"The Infusium 23 shampoo was adequate. I enjoyed the light fragrance, it wasn't overpowering like some other shampoos. I also liked the fact that it took only a small amount to work up a good lather. I couldn't tell if the shampoo held up to its claims of adding more body or not, I don't have limp, fine hair, so it was hard to tell. I do have shoulder length hair, which I use styling products on. I noticed Infusium 23 did a good job of removing the styling product residue. Overall, I'd rate the product adequate, but not outstanding."
"Recently i've been looking to buy a cheap curling iron. i came across this one and thought vidal sassoon was a brand that's been around for a while. well. after ""curling"" my hair it just looked like i poorly straightend it. seriously. i am taking this back immediatly. don't waist your money or your time on this. maybe if you have thinner hair it would work. i dont know."
The book arrived as scheduled and I could receive it at my hotel where I stayed during my business trip. Thank you very much.
"This is such a sweet toy. I can't say enough good things about it, really. I found this on-line while I was creating my baby registry, and decided when my daughter was born to investigate further to see if it was actually something we wanted to purchase. I am so glad that we did. So much so that it has become the gift that I give to all my friends at their baby showers. It is just the best.From very early on, I found that my daughter was soothed by the music. I could put her in her crib (with the toy a safe distance away, of course :)) and turn it on, and it would hold her attention so I could attend to other things. Now that she is 7 months old, it has become a savior at night. My daughter is a tough sell at 'night-night' time, but 'Mr. Pooh' has become a staple in our nightly routine. As soon as I press the pillow to start the music, she smiles.We recently travelled to visit my husband's family and took 'Mr. Pooh' with us. If my daughter became fussy once I put her down to sleep, I could easily turn this on and within minutes, she would settle down. It was great, and the slowly dimming night-light was a real added bonus.It's really not a toy you might rate as very 'educational' in the traditional sense perhaps (except that it does expose your child to different musical and nature-type sounds). But if your child likes music, as mine does, this is a wonderful addition to any toy repertoire. I just think it's the sweetest, and so does my daughter, which is really all that counts, huh? :)"
"I was searching for a gift for my soon to be step daughter. This was going to be my first gift to her and on her 13th birthday no less. I wanted to get her something educational and fun. What made my search even more difficult was the fact that she is 13 going on 30 and I didnt want to get her anything too mature but not something that would make her feel like i was babying her either. In searching, I stumbled upon this game and although I didnt know anything about it or anyone that had purchased it, the reviews swayed me. Well I was not disappointed. My step daughter absolutely loved it. She spent the entire day of her birthday playing with her Mom and anyone else she could convince to play with her. She thanked me over and over again and said it was great. To top it all off it reached her 2 days after i placed the order with regular shipping. I am an average jaded NYer that feels too cool and too busy to take the time to write a review. This game made me take the time. Enough said!!"
I bought this game for my friends son and it works great. He loves playing with it and I like playing with it myself. It's inter active so you feel like your in the game and you can play against someone or by yourself.
"We found at first it to be a nice fountain, however ...........We no longer use this product, the way it is assembled with the motor housing connecting to the bottom, occasionally would vibrate water out onto the floor, we had a tray underneath the fountain, but to come in and find a lake wasn't a good feeling.We opted for a different fountain, the pioneer pet big dog, it holds a little less water but the pump is on the inside and water will only spill out if it is overfilled."
I am a First Grade teacher and I used these dominoes to teach fact families. It was wonderful for the kids who needed a bigger challenge as it offered higher numbers to use. The kids loved using them and it really added to my differentiated instruction.
"This color is really pretty. I am looking for more of a bright pink, so this wasn't for me. Flamingo pink has a lot of purple undertones. Still really nice color and application was easy. Cleans off of tubs and sinks easily with a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser :) Has a really pleasant scent as well and takes much longer than Manic Panic to wash out!"
"I just wanted to leave clarification here to all buyers who see bad ratings, I read thru bad reviews and most of them are not about product itself but about political issues. Apparently everybody else including me loved the product, I just wish that Amazon wouldn't become ground for political statements, there are other places to do so."
"Nice product, received on time as told. Very satisfied with the service and product overall.Thanks,"
"The picture was different from the item we received but we like what we received better. Squeeker still works and still not torn up, gave to the dogs as a Christmas gift...that is pretty good!!!"
"I was pretty happy with the smell and texture of the product itself, however, for the money, I was extremely disappointed that it was gone within 3 weeks! I only used it once a day and occassionally a second time at night. Way too expensive for how long it lasts."
Delightful parfum...but very hard to find in the stores. I'm glad I could buy it on-line.
"I bought three of these collars for my cats because we're moving and I want them to have IDs.In the past, I've tried the wider collars with the safety snap. When I put those on, the cats would wiggle and squirm trying to get the collar off and with the safety snap they eventually unlatched them. Plus, the width of other collars tends to mat the hair around their necks.This collar, so far, is far superior. Two of my cats were hesitant about having something go over their head, but once the Safety Collar was on, they haven't thought twice about it. They haven't tried to get them off or scratched at them, it doesn't seem to bother them at all and since these collars are so thin, the fur on their necks aren't suffering.The sliding motion of the collar is easy to move back and forth yet secure enough to stay in place with regular use. The colors are very vibrant. I got Mango Orange, Maui Blue, and Tulip Red but unfortunately, since my cats have long hair the color gets lost in their fur. But that doesn't take anything away from how much I love these collars.If your not sure, these are inexpensive enough to give a try! If you need to put a collar on your cat, I think these are one of the best options available!"
"Zirh's products are amazing. Scrub will be like giving yourself a new layer of skin, and this mask is like detoxifying the whole thing. All I can say guys, is that if you want to look great going into your 40s and 50s (and beyond) this is certainly a way to do it. WELL worth the money."
This was offered with another product. I ordered both. The other was vastly superior. The Petco product was junk. Even the dog prefers the other one.
Legges are not detachable as the instruction claimed to be. Do not buy. Mis-leading instruction and picture on the package.
"I used this product for one month. I thought if I kept using it that maybe it would eventually work. It made my skin old looking. I stopped using Strivectin. Now I am using a cheap creme and my face is back to normal.LauraSeattle, Washington"
Hair
My two Rottweilers love this ball. It is extremely durable and holds up to two aggressive chewers. I have bought two of these balls and plan to purchase more. They are great for indoors because of the rubber material (doesn't harm the floors or walls). I hightly recommend this ball!
"Ordering item and delivery was exceptional. However I was VERY disappointed with the brush. I have several of the Bio ionic brushes and loved them!! The newer versions are missing the rubber grip on the handle and the new ""super smooth"" handle makes it almost impossible to hold firmly. I had to resort to wrapping the handle with grip tape. Unfortunately due to the change I would not order this product again until they put the rubber grip back on the handle. Very unfortunate as it was an awesome brush and worth every penny:( It is now a complete waste of money"
"This garage is very durable and a neat toy. My son is very rough on toys, and he hasn't broken it yet. It came with a video, too. He has become bored with the garage, but still loves the video."
"Very soft flowery scent. As I heard, this is a limited edition from Guerlain. It says that it is reccommended for evening, how it smells on me, it is not really heavy, on contrary soft and really nice. If you like jadore by dior, or glamourous by lauren, you might like this."
"This mesh carrier is great - I received it very fast and am very happy with the quality of the product. I would highly recommend it to anyone with a small animal that wants to take your pet along. Also, it was about $10 cheaper than anywhere else I could find it."
This product seemed like fun for my cats. My cats liked it when it first arrived then grew bored with it soon after. My cats are very spoiled and older. I think a kitten would be delighted with it 24/7.
"I have been married for 24 years and every since I have known her, my wife has used this perfume. It is a great product that is subtle and not overwhelming."
purchased 1 it worked great purchased 5 more 4 of 5 either parts broke or just stopped working poor quality.
"I bought this for my new puppy, be he just ignored the sprayed area. One of my cats, which knew how to use litter already, ended up peeing on the sprayed doggie pee pad. I think it really depends on pets =/"
This zoid was my 5th zoid built by me.I like this one. This zoid has beaten every zoid almost.My sister has the same zoid but...SHE BROKE IT!No wonder she cannot get any zoids any more.
I always keep a tube of Lansinoh Lanolin around - It is wonderful for breastfeeding and it is great for diaper rash or chappy skin.
"This has become one of our favorite, often played, family games. I like this much better than the board game! When my child (age 9)wants to play a game, this is one of the few that we actually play and enjoy. Yes, as one reviewer noted, there is some luck of the draw involved, but there is definitely stategy too! The only drawback to the card version of the game is probably that you don't really 'get to know' much about the characters as much as you do in the board game."
"What a great gift for a pirate lover! Not to mention that it was cheaper at Amazon than at any store we looked. Very cute, love that the cannons work. Our son has used many different figures to go on pirate adventures and rescues."
I adopted my dog a little over 2 years ago and it's been absolutely wonderful. She's a great companion
Ummm... What can you say about a board game? It's like most games that combine strategy with luck. They're pretty fun. This game it pretty fun.
"My name is Lydia and I'm six years old. I love the yellow Blinkie, and I also have the purple Blinkie. If you have two children, one little brother or sister, and the big girl or boy has a Blinkie, you might want to get the little brother or sister a Blinkie, so that they will not grab yours all the time. I put some useful information about playing with the Blinkie in my review of the purple Blinkie. All the Blinkies do the same stuff."
"I was at the fragrance counter at the mall, going through all of the generic floral/vanilla/oriental perfumes, when I sniffed L'eau par Kenzo. It started out with a sparkling burst of a leafy, grassy note that instantly reminded me of a fresh spring lawn covered with dew. Then the grassy note merged harmoniously with a bright citrus, which later warmed up at the edges with a sweet hint of vanilla. The light drydown was ethereal, and reminded me of something warm and watery (in a good way) and shifting. It lasted on me for the rest of the day, and I caught whiffs of it throughout the night.The delicacy and harmony of the notes in this perfume is very impressive. Rather than hitting you over the head with a bunch of cloying flowers, it starts off with a unique splash of green, and then proceeds to morph into a lovely, clean, slightly sweet and unobtrusive aura.This is a wonderful departure from the typical headache-inducing mass-market scents that smell like candied flowers and fruits. It makes a statement by NOT assaulting your nose and screaming SMELL ME. It's one of those scents that, like a dream, will stay with you, and will make you perk up each time you catch a whiff of it in the future.This perfume has the delicate touch and quality of artisan and niche perfumes, and I was pleasantly surprised by its very accessible price tag. I usually pay 2-3 times more for something of this quality. The only downside is that it's a very light scent, and will probably disappear in colder weather. The only solution is to keep spritzing it on you throughout the day."
Pros
"This product works well to prevent scratches on the door when it is in place. However, the small velcro dots do not seem to hold on to the door well. The velcro sides are fine, but the adhesive side for the door comes losse very often, especially when the weather turned cold. I would supplement this product with better adhesive velcro dots, or for that matter, cut out your own piece of thick clear vinyl and create your own."
Keeps our dogs busy for a very long time. Great in the toys for puppies too! Better they chew this than anything else in the house! Highly recommended.
"The kids loved the GI Joe DVD, the action figures are somewhere around the house and we through out the tiny pieces, swords, guns, etc. because we have a baby in the house. The stand is good if you are going to display the action figures, otherwise its pretty much useless. Ours went in the trash. I let my son purchase a toy for good behavior and this is what he picked. Like I said they liked the dvd."
"My cat loves these, and the price is right! I love having them in bulk because it's hard to keep track of where they've all ended up after being batted around all over the house."
Porter's lotion is the one if you want your skin to look moisturized all day! It is unlike any lotion you have ever used...yet it works without any greasy feeling or sticky top coat.
"Before this I had only used the Turby Twist or some other generic type of hair wrap. My old one was dying and I decided to splurge and buy a nicer one. You get what you pay for! The Aquis Microfiber Hair Turban just sucks all the water out of my hair, leaving it almost dry and definitely in good shape to blow dry and style. It's also larger and more flexible, making it very comfortable to wear. I've only had it a few days, but it definitely seems much more durable than my old one, so it should last a long time. If you don't mind spending a little extra money on something you will use daily, I highly recommend it. You would probably spend more replacing the generic ones anyway."
I must agree with previous reviews. Darth Maul's lightsaber broke before I even got him out of the box. Not nearly as good as other Star Wars products....disappointing...
Another A+ for the hasbro mlp line. These playsets are great. The key missing ingredient is IMAGINATION! And that is what the child adds! There is just enough toy to get the imagination going which makes it educational. I do recommend these toys for children over 4 or 5 tho. They are not toddler toys. My daughter is 8 and just loves all her little pony playsets. We have no trouble keeping them together. She plays with them for hours and when I can I do too! Keep up the good work hasbro and generations to come will be looking for these toys on ebay like I did the 80's playsets!
"I picked this stuff up by chance a couple years ago and have used it ever since. Ive tried the cheap Fructis products and the more expensive JCrew pomades, Redken etc. I never could find something that worked. In addition to other gels, I found myself using hairspray with them. The HardUp gel by ShortSexyHair eliminates the need for multiple applications or hairspray and still leaves your hair looking the way you left it in the morning. I will never use another product. Oftentimes its hit or miss finding it at Walmart or CVS, so I checked Amazon and ill be purchasing through them for the nice price."
After reading Amazon reviews I ordered two of the Large litter boxes. Unfortunately they turned out to be a tight fit for two of my three cats. Returning them to the Amazon seller was too much trouble (no UPS return labels available) so I donated them to our local shelter and found Jumbo boxes at Target. The boxes themselves are nicely made and last a very long time judging from the ones I'm replacing. My cats have always been happy with them.
"English Leather Cologne has been a toiletry staple of mine since high school 40+ years ago and has consistently drawn compliments over these years. During this time, there have been various manufacturers of this fragrance (remember MEM?) but it's quality has remained consistent. Whereas I've had some severe disappointments with other ""classic fragrances"" lately, the quality of English Leather is holding up quite nicely."
"We have owned seveal copies of this card game. As a family with five children, we love that a child from 4 to 90 can play it and like it too. My daughter called from college today and said that she and her friends played it after lunch during finals week more than once! We keep seveal boxes in our gift stash to share with freinds for birthdays. It is easy to learn. Try giving all the Queens new and exotic names for an added fun."
"My 3 year old just got this toy for Christmas, and she loves it!!We play together, but she also plays alone with it. It really helps to improve cognitive skills. I hope that I can find more backpack cards to go with it."
"This is not what I remember the original smelling like, This has a horrible smell I would not even use this as air freshener this is a knock off that is out of control!"
I bought this toy for a friends daughter who just turned 2. She was in a no bath phase for a week until the penguins came in. She loved them. Now she wants to take baths all of the time.
(...)THEY HURT YOUR EYES AND BREACK EASLY.(...)
"When I bought this I thought I was buying a plushy toy for I did not pay attention to the dimensions. However this toy is made really well and is very detailed.The company that makes these makes a lot of different animals. I have bought a number of their birds. But this toy is small, fits in the palm of your hand."
I own five dogs and one that had nails from puppymill world.... This tool is great and worked on her nails! She hated the clipper and had issues with her feet. After working on them every week she has more normal nails. She does not mind the sound after being introduced to it first. Love the product and all my dogs but one pom who pull have no problem with me using the grinder on their feet. The one that has issue's allows me to work on her feet if my husband rubs her belly. Great tool and worth the money!
"I bought this similar kong about 5 yrs ago for my lab (who is now 10 yrs old) and its the only toy that he has not been able to destroy or chew parts off. I bought this product again for a friends young lab because they could not find toys that were durable enough for a chewer such as a lab. They have told me that their lab loves the kong and he chews on it daily but the toy is still 100% in tact. Buy this toy for your power chewer. For a full grown dog, buy the xtra large size. This large size seems to be good for a younger or smaller dog cause its not really that big."
"Well, this is a special find. I obsess on dinos here and again, and always like toys to look at to help me imagine the dinos more thoroughly. I also like to display toys of current interests - monsters and the such. Finding a good, realistic dino is hard to come by!! I tried doing a few models, but am not the modeling type - - so when I stumbled across the Papo dinosaurs, it was like a gift!! These are sturdy, durable, extremely realistic toys - and my first one was the lovely Velociraptor. It's great! A realistic, mature depiction of what a real Raptor might look like - and the working jaw is nice, but it's a display toy; meant more for office spaces at work, or a desktop (for an adult) than it is for a kid. It's nice to not have them so articulated, as it adds to the realism of the creature and pose. The JPark toys were horrible, and not very good representations of realistic dinos. The Papo creatures are just right if you want a good, adult dino to spark your imagination. Great, great toys - you can't get 'em any better than this!!"
"Kirk's Castile Original Coco soap is perfect for those that do not wish to have animal by- products in their soaps, nor use products tested on animals. The information contained on the packaging clearly states that there are no synthetic detergents or animal by-products. The glycerin used in the soap is vegetable and the rest of the formula is quite simple. I had been looking for a vegetarian friendly soap, and found it in this product that has been around since 1839. The soap provides a rich lather, and washes off better than many of the soaps on the market. The fragrance of the soap is pleasant and not overbearing. The soap does seem to last a shorter time, but the results on the skin and the knowledge that the soap is all natural and guilt free makes it worth buying a bit more frequently. I am surprised organizations that promote vegetarian lifestyles do not mention this soap,as I could have used it years ago. Besides buying it on Amazon, it's also available in major grocery stores (Fry's, Safeway, etc) and independent stores, as well as Kirk's on-line."
I was happy when the shipment came earlier than the date it said it would be shipped.
"Over the years I have tried other products, but ultimately return to biolage. It's great for naturally curly hair."
The good memories I have with this one.This fragrance is NOT to overbearing but really stands out in a way that someone WILL ask you what you are wearing.
"The turbo twist spelling is a terrific educational tool, however, it is worth the extra $$ for the mind station. My first grader struggled with his weekly spelling tests. He was even put in a special group that only tested on half of the words. It really became a chore and he was getting discouraged. For Christmas he received turbo twist spelling and the mind station which enabled us to download just his spelling words for the week. He has scored 100 on every exam since then and scored extra points for challenge words as well!!! I am amazed at what a difference this has made. We have all of his tests since Christmas on the fridge. Thank you!"
"I bought this collar for my 9 lb. Havapoo and I'm having trouble getting it adjusted properly for him. Though very furry, he's got a tiny neck and the pronged electronic piece is a little heavy. Thus the behavior I get when I put it on him in any location on his neck is that it falls below his neck and I think it's losing contact. Now clearly, this is not the fault of the product as it works just fine (tried it on my leg). However, I would caution owners with very small dogs that it might be difficult to adjust properly. We have an electric fence for our 90 lb. Golden Retriever but you can't fence a 9 lb. and a 90 lb. dog on the same system. Thus we tried this remote. One other very important caution - READ ALL THE DIRECTIONS FIRST! I almost cut through the wire transmitter on the collar when adjusting the length to fit Rocky. Luckily, I didn't. In summary, this collar works fine but for very small dogs, the weight of the receiver may prevent good contact. I'm still going to try to get this to fit better as I believe that it's a good product."
"Muy buena calidad de los materiales, mientras no se mojen con agua caliente ya que se empiezan a despintar... mi pecado fue no comprar mas bloques..."
Just like dice - but more entertaining! I used this game to fill time at my son's &quot;camp out&quot; birthday party. The boys were 8-11 years old and had a blast &quot;passing the pigs&quot; around the table. Just don't &quot;pig out!&quot;
I bought this toy for my daughter's 2nd birthday. She does like playing with it and has learned the names of quite a few dinosaurs.Pros
this is a cool item for removing ticks fron dog kids and me.service was great
"My miniature poodle loves his new bed!It fits perfectly in a crate that I bought on amazon (see my other review)We like the border as he rests his head on it.I've already washed it once, stuck in the dryer and it's brand new again."
"I'm a guy who likes to smell good, ands Hugo Boss has some of the best cologne there is. I can proudly say I own every Hugo Boss cologne!Boss#6 is a big hit with the ladies, Really! I wouldn't sit here and waste my time writing a review if I were lying! You can't go wrong if you purchase this cologne! I'll be using this until the day I die or if by chance god forbid they discontinue it (I doubt that would ever happen!)It's kind of sweet, but definitely in a manly way. You wouldn't mistake it for perfume, but if you are a real macho man who likes old spice then this is not the cologne for you! If you want a really attractive smell that lasts long but doesn't overpower the room, than buy this stuff, you won't regret it!"
I've never found such a great deal! Excellent price for big quantity of this classic frangrance.
"The Mavala Stop is the only product that gets me to stop biting my nails because the unpleasant, bitter taste is just off putting enough."
"I was very impressed by the quality of these hooves. Usually I purchase a ten pack of hooves for my dogs at my local Pet Food Express for about $8, which is a good value. This is a far superior deal. The hooves are nearly twice as large, ranging from 3.5""-5"", mostly on the larger end of the scale. I estimate that there are about thirty in the 5lb box, but due to their superior size, you get at least 25% more value with this over the Pet Food Express hooves, maybe as much as 50%. I will definitely buy these again.If you have never purchased cow hooves for your dog, there are two important aspects to consider -- one positive, and one negative. On the downside, they stink, and they make your dog smell like a barnyard (temporarily). Not a good thing. On the other hand, they have unsurpassed benefits. They are long-lasting (days or weeks rather than minutes) and they remove tartar from a dog's teeth better than anything else I've tried. Bully sticks get eaten too fast, raw hide isn't digestible and can damage a dog's intestines, and knuckle bones lose their charm after the yummy bits are gone. These hooves, however, are fabulous. My 5 year old dog has completely reversed her tooth decay after a year chewing hooves, and she used to have the telltale black-brown color at the top of all of her teeth. Now they are white again!I cannot recommend hooves more highly. And these are good quality hooves."
"I'd like to start my review by spreading the word I read here - If you tape some small weights inside the seat of this toy it will make it much sturdier. I put 20lbs of dumbbells in there when my daughter was first learning how to pull up so it wouldn't fall over on her.This toy was the catalyst that propelled my 11-month old baby to be an 11-month old toddler. She learned to walk by pushing on this toy. The first time she pulled herself up with this toy and walked unassisted my knees were like jello, as if it was me learning to walk for the first time!My daughters older cousins come over and play with this toy too. It's a very good value."
"The Soft Sorter by Lamaze is a good toy for a 6-month-old baby, and for olderkids as well. It's easy to play with, safe and fun."
"A little thick the leave in. It has a great smell and I am excited to see what effects it will have on my hair. I am a black woman with natural hair. I am using it as a part of my Kimmaytube's leave in conditioner, so we will see!!!"
"My 9 month old loves this toy. It captures his attention for quite some time. He likes to chase the train and pull the balls out, and then put them back in to watch them go around. My dog also likes to watch the balls around and often hits the button on the top of the train when my son is not playing with it. Great toy! The music is kind of loud, but it keeps the baby quiet, so I won't complain!"
"Our 8 pound terrier/yorkie mix is sweet as can be, but she has a most unpleasant high pitched bark.. She would bark when anyone came by our house or if anyone came to the door. She would bark if a doorbell rang on TV. She would bark if another dog in the neighborhood was barking. I tried the water spray, which worked, except I couldn't always get to her in time for it to be effective.This collar, has changed our lives. The first time I put it on her, she barked ONCE. After that, she went to her bed and we didn't hear a peep out of her for 2 hours. I took the collar off and she remained quiet for the rest of the day.. That evening she started barking so I put the collar back on. Again, she barked ONCE and stopped. Since then, she has not barked at all in the house. Once in a while she will have a little growl, but all I have to do is show her the collar and she stops. I would highly recommend this product. It's safe, humane and effective..Thank you."
"When I first opened this product, a wonderful smell emerged from the bottle. It makes my hair shiny and soft. Be careful not to use too much product, it will make hair greasy."
"I've tried a lot of acne kits, even those expensive ones, & none of them worked. Then I saw this while looking around Amazon & read the reviews. It works wonders! I have sensitive skin & it made my skin dry & flaky at first. Well, I've been using it for 3 weeks now, once a day, & my skin is totally clear! Two thumbs up! :)"
This is a sturdy roll-up mat that is perfect for those without the space for a permanently displayed hardwood board. It also makes a great travel mat; I've packed it into luggage several times and it's no worse for wear.
"I like this moisturizer. I use it with skinceuticals b5 gel, and it goes on smoothe and sinks right in. It's not greasy at all. It's a great basic moisturizer for a decent price."
I already had on dog reel lease for a chocolate lab so this was for my smaller mix-breed dog. I'm using one reel in each hand and find it quite good and relatively easy to do. I am concerned with a fraying of the pull cord about two feet from the snap end. The bags dispense pretty well but are sometimes hard to separate---especially while tending two dogs.
"I got this for Christmas this year. WE played it and we had a blast! The instructions were not hard to understand, and we all ended up laughing so hard!! It is a really great family game. I think you could play it with children under 12 also, as long as they can spell ""dog"" or ""cat"". Then you tell them to write either of those words and you crack up when you read the saying. It is especially great for parties!!"
"Felt like I lost part of myself when I couldn't find my Fendi - I feel like my ""dressing-up"" is complete now - I don't spend many dollars on myself - this purchase was worth it."
"Exactly as described, received my order quickly. Have not been able to find in stores and was happy to find on line."
"I received this as a gift in July 2012. The corn popper that is currently for sale is very poorly made. The wheels DO NOT ROLL, on either carpet or on hardwood. I have a hard time making it pop when I am pushing it myself, exerting considerable downward force.My one year-old daughter is a great walker but could never get this going. She carries it around with her sometime, but I don't even think she understands what it is supposed to do.Additionally, the older models used to have a switch on the underside that could turn off the ""popping."" This switch is gone. When I called my Mom to complain that ours didn't work, she told me to check to make sure it was in the ""on"" position. When I let her know that no such switch existed she couldn't believe how much Fisher Price has cut corners to wreck a toy that used to be such a crowd-pleaser.Don't buy this unless you find an old used one at a tag sale."
"Several months ago one of my domestic short hairs started shedding. It was spring, shedding was to be expected. She was shedding a LOT, so much that when my husband and I went to pet her gobs of hair would go flying everywhere and we would both end up with stuffy noses, even though we both have very mild allergies. Her fur was EVERYWHERE- even in gobs on the ceiling fan and the WALLS. This went on for months, and when I realized she'd been shedding this much for too long I got worried. When I pulled her hair just seemed to come out! So panicked and took her to the vet. He checked her out and told me there was nothing wrong with her- she was perfectly healthy, but just had a heavy undercoat that wasn't coming off with my normal brushing. He pulled out one of these babies and did a once over- I was standing there panicking and asked a few times just to make SURE that she was okay.. I couldn't believe all the fur that was coming off!! He recommended this to me, so I went home and did my research on it.I ordered and when it came in I sat my kitties down to be brushed. Due to the reviews I was careful about how much pressure I put on the brush, and brushed like the vet did (not a normal brush). Here's the thing (IMPORTANT TIP:) you need to brush in short bursts (one or two inches, maybe more), and go back up and start near where you ended, and repeat going down the way the fur grows. You can do this in a faster motion if you'd like, just don't do it with too much pressure. If you just drag it all along the cat, I would imagine that may just rip the hair and just not be very good in general. I was careful about how many times I went over them, but never saw any thinning at all.Lots of fur came off of both of them, and I finished up with a regular wire brush to smooth things out and get the extra out, then pet them lastly to get any stuff hanging around. Works like a charm! I LOVE this thing! Both of their coats are even softer and shinier than they were before (they were already very much so). The one that was shedding most NEVER likes being brushed, but she tolerated it. The other of my cats loves being brushed and loved this also, so no problems with them not liking it.Over all I'm very pleased with Furminator, as are my kitties! No more undercoat making them extra hot in this summer heat, giving them digestive issues, or getting all over the apartment! 5 stars! I would recommend it to others. (However this is only for short haired cats- I am unsure how well it would work on a long haired cat.)"
"Repairs, nourishes and strengthens hair inside and out. Leaves hair soft, tangle free and smooth, not sticky or weighed down. Excellent treatment."
"I was highly disappointed with this. We bought this for my son at Christmas (16 months old then) thinking it would be a great educational toy for him to play with when I couldn't be sitting down with him (like when I'm cooking). We were terribly wrong! We have 2 friends who also bought this and are just as disappointed.This is not a toy you can give a child and walk away. First, it's complicated to use for a toddler. Every time you turn a page, you must hit the green go button. RIGHT! Second, the books are made of paper and are pretty flimsy. Plus they are rather pricey for the cheap quality. Third, the setting that reads the story is so slow, my impatient toddler never lets me wait to turn the pages before the story is ready. Finally, I'm not pleased with the educational value of the books for the cost. I can buy books on shapes, color, numbers,etc myself and sit and go through the books with my son and he gets a lot more out of it.Overall, I should have taken this (and the 5 books we bought) back and bought something else."
"My son loves this toy. He caught on very quickly... how to push the people down and have them pop up. He plays with this toy a lot. It is simple, yet engaging."
"Beautiful!! We love this giraffe! It is truly wonderful and makes us smile whenever we look at it. A word of caution, however, about the head. It feels as though the head has a base formed with a styrofoam type product, unlike the rest of the body. I have my doubts that the head would hold up to much pressure. This is the only reason I've given the giraffe a 4 star rating for durability. The more fragile feeling base material does allow the head to have more of a lifelike appearance then if it had been made completely of a softer material. I would rate the rest of the giraffe's body with 5 stars for durability.Melissa and Doug Giraffe - Plush"
I have been buying these cat liners for the past 5 years. They are excellent quality at a reasonable price
"I love this semi-permanent hair color. It has built in detangler so it makes it really easy to comb through. Excess dye washes right off of scalp, doesn't have an odor, and doesn't burn the scalp . My last application was about 4 months ago, so I can say that it did last longer than expected. Doesn't contain peroxide or ammonia so I applied after my relaxer and my hair looks amazing! I will continue to use this!"
"The grass grew slowly and one blade at a time. My cat would uproot each blade as it came up, so there was never a nice healthy patch of grass."
"I bought this bank for my 4 year old son and he loves it. My only compliant is that the money container in the back fills up too quickly and its too easy for my son to open the back. But as far as teaching him how to count money and money trivia, this bank is great!!"
I have used this product for over 2 years now and find it helps keep the eyes and mouth of both of our Maltese dogs cleaner than any other product on the market. I would recommend it to anyone that has a white or light colored cat or dog. The price is right on Amazon!
"My son got this from santa when he was 3, he loves it!!! Occasionally the space helmet popls off, but is easily put back on. It has really stood up to the durability test too. The voice soinds like the actual buzz lightyear!"
"We have had our system in the ground for almost 18 years. We are ready to replace the wire soon but it has been a great product for us. Recently installed one at my mother's house too. We did have to replace the unit when lightening burned it our many years ago but Radio Fence as it was called back then worked with us on it. Have not had a problem with the unit since..did add a lightening rod to it. We have had three different dogs and many cats on ours. We live on a busy black top road and did not want to lose a pet. So far not a pet has been lost! Will always have one and thinking about one for our cottage now. Did have to get the stubborn dog collar when we got our male german sheppard. Boy, does he respect the boundaries. We cover about 1.5 acres and do have trouble with breaks once in awhile but just hook it up to some electricity to reconnect the breaks and it works again. We admit we need to put new wire in...many tree roots are doing some damage now..but that is not the fault of the fence, and it has been in the ground for 18 years!"
"This is an excellent figure as he has great sculpting, tremendous quality, superb articulation, cloth clothing and an incredible amount of weapons and accessories! There are several different ways to use the weapons like attach swords together for longer swords, attach weapons onto guns for more power etc. For ages 10 and up in My opinion. I strongly recommend this figure and in My opinion this is the series of the year! Bottom line this is a must have figure if you are a big G.I. Joe fan!"
"I have received the SpraySense instead of GentleSpray as shown in the amazon picture. And it already broke , the quality is very very low on the new ones, probably made in China. The older ones in two colors were a lot better.ITEM WAS NOT AS DESCRIBED !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This is the only cleansing lotion I have ever found that I can actually use. It is very gentle on my face. It gets all the makeup off, and it doesn't dry out my skin. In fact, it does the opposite, it makes my skin look younger. The entire Aubrey line is excellent, but I have to say, this is their crowning jewel."
"It did work, but it made my hair feel disgusting. If you just need it to look fuller, but don't ever want to touch it, it's great. I think the TIGI little pump bottle (purple round dispenser) works even better, but still leaves a residue that makes my scalp feel like it is suffocating."
Wow wow wow all I can say is WOW! I haven't yet received my item - but I can allready leave my comment - how fun is it Five stars of course - I think I love Little People as much or more than my 2 1/2 year old son! Educational value - what better way to teach toddlers the true meaning of Christmas than with cute little characters they can relate to! Durabilaty - I guarntee if I had purchased this a year ago when my son chewed on everything insight these would have made quite the teeter :) they're tough little plastice pieces - what more can I say! I'll be ordering many more for nieces - nephews - and friends children!
My 2 year old received this from her grandparents for Christmas. Luckily she is too young to be disappointed. The toy doesn't stay together at all! The Care Bears don't fit into the slide or stay on the pegs meant to hold them. The only positive thing about this toy is that it is cute to look at and my daughter uses the Care Bear figurines to play with her Fisher-Price Little People.
"The portable pet home is a savior! Very comfortable to take your pets on a car trip, take them to the vet or leave it open at home for them to rest. Also, I thought the small size was going to be a lot smaller, it can easily and very comfotably acommodate two small chihuahuas.I own a kitty and she loves it, she uses it at home to hide away and have some privacy. Also, it is very unexpensive once you realize all the uses you can give it."
"My daughter was so excited to receive this after seeing them flying at the mall. Big disappointment! They must have several there(the mall) for back up, because it takes 11 minutes to charge and only 4 minutes before having to recharge. Two of the four minutes the thing flies while the the last two are spent hovering on the ground.It is made of styrafoam and and has to take off from a flat even surface. There is no steering, just up and down motion. Be extreemley careful outdoors, the wind will blow it into a neighbors yard, very easily.I would actually pay $2.00 or $3.00 for the Hover Copter. I wish I hadn't paid the $19.99.Don't Buy It!!!"
"this cologne is the reason i love the summer, its soo light and citruisy that it simply lasts the entire day. but what really gets me is when it mixes with my body and the oder of the sweat simply mixes with the fragrance to give off a unique smell that is soo good i cant describe it. it is the true essence of a perfume which was created by the french to hide the dirty foul smell of body oder. i think you can even put this on without even deodorant it is that good! if you love smells of the summer, and something subtle and really last for a long long time on you then go for this cologne. it is simply devine..."
"First unit lasted two years and the switch gave out. From reviews and comments online this seems to be a constant theme. But, since we had the holes on the wall, we gave it another try. Second one, just one one year, and flames came out of the dryer and actuallly singed hair. One year and one month so warranty doesn't matter. On the other hand, I am not sure I want more burnt hair. I will have to find some other solution to hair drying. The portable dryers we have, some well over 20 years old, seem to work when called upon. Perhaps we have to go back to putting one in a drawer and pulling it out as we did for many years before the flame thrower."
"I travel a lot for work. Airplanes and stress really take a toll on my skin. I love Haeru because it is fast and convenient and gives me immediate results. It's not that I'm impatient, but I hate that every other product tells me I need 4 to 6 weeks to see results. This stuff is so easy to spray on and it IMMEDIATELY hydrates my skin - I spray a couple of times a day to keep my skin even (takes care of those pesky breakouts) and bright (keeps me a healthy pink). Oh, and I never ever fly or travel without it."
"This leader is amazing! I have a 2-year old 75 pound female Rottweiler who pulls excessively. Eventually, it became hard for me and my family to take her on walks, as she could practically pull us to the ground. She was choking herself and you had to throw your weight backwards not to get pulled to the ground. So, after doing a little research, we purchased the Gentle Leader. It came pretty quickly, so we watched fitting videos, got her used to it, and then fitted her. Then, finally, one day, we took her for a little walk. At first, she pitched a fit for about two minutes. But with a little coaxing, we were able to get her walking happily. After about 5 minutes, she got the hang of it and was walking perfectly beside us! It is very well designed and works perfectly! Definitely getting another one for our other 7-month old 70 pound Rottweiler puppy! Highly recommended!Premier Pet Gentle Leader Headcollar, Black, Large"
"I got these for my puppy then my negihbor gave me some that she had. I liked these more, they are harder for my puppy to destroy then the other ones and that is a big plus. One less thing to have to clean up."
"Broke on the first take off which did not even make it in the air. Also, when we recieve the package and looked on the back of the box there was a warning that product contained a chemical that may cause cancer, so you need to make sure that if you buy this product wash hands and keep childrens hands out there mouth. Not a product I would recommend for a child."
"Years ago I was driving through the hills of PA, in the snow, with tired child and 3 hours to go.Stopped at creepy only place open truck stop for gas. Pum ped the gas, fumbled with stroller and kidto go inside to pay for the petrol. Felt this enormous truckers eyes boring through me, too tired to give a rip.As he followed me outside, I started worrying. Stopped and made a production about getting my cel phone out.Made it to the car, got kid in car seat, thought about dumping the stroller. He appeared by my window, banged on the glass and said ""I was standing behind you in line. I have to know what perfume you are wearing, it made me feel great and my wife will love it."" Felt like an ass as I wrote down ""Knowing."" This fragrance has illicited similar responses for over 20 years. Please help me find powder refills!"
I find this cream easy to use. It goes on like a liquid and helps if you have dry skin. It is great if you have allergies. This goes on with no greasy feeling at all in fact it feels like water. I would recommend this if you have allergy problems and dry skin.
I am so glad that they have a Luke VI lightsaber. I was going to make a force action one but then I saw this one. I hope it lights up so when I do buy it I can hear the noise. Green Luke lightsabers are very rare so you don't see them in stores very often. I wish to get this soon!
"THIS BLADE IS AWESOME!!!When I was battling my friend one day my friend used a Wolborg #2,and I used my Driger F and after we lauched are blades, my blade went up to his blade, and my friends blade flew right out of the arena and hit him on the chest.The next time we battled it did the same thing,but my friends blade hit me on the chest.This blade is the best i've ever seen.Sorry for any misspelled words.and don't forget, LET IT RIP!!!"
"Love this clipper! Very sharp, and great quality of materials. Still was pricey though, you shouldnt have to spend so much just to get sharp clippers. The only thing I wish it had is a file. The clippers are so sharp it leaves a sharp 90 degree angle at the end which bothers me. But they do the job they are supposed to do."
We love this. The questions are awesome. My kids brought this to school. The teacher now uses this in class to stimulate discussion and creative writing.
"Yes, it has been around for a long time. But I have young people tell me how much they love the fragrance. I am one of those that finds something they love and sticks to it!! Why take a chance on something newer hen this is so wonderful? I also love it is not one of those overpowering, cloying, gagging perfumes that pass by me most days."
"This thing is really amazing. The first time I brushed my cat with this, there was a pile of hair large enough to make another cat. She really enjoys being brushed with the Furminator too. She'll just rub right up against it."
"I have worked in grooming and as a veterinarian technician and have never found anything like this shampoo before. I have cocker spaniels and as is well known about the breed, these little girls and guys can get some gross skin issues and I have tried a number of shampoos and conditioners on them and this by far is the best! Keep up the good work and continue this product, you have a loyal customer here."
"Love this curling iron. I own several ""Hot Tools"" irons and love all of them. I personally haven't had the paint wear off, but guess that it eventually would. As long as it keeps getting hot, I'm ok with it."
"my wife and i like XSnot too strong, not too musky, just righti like the bottle - especially the closing snapzippo lighter type top - fun to snap closed - too big to snap open with one hand like a zippo, but otherwise okalso 3 or 4 squirts just right - lasts about 6 monthsi keep a spare, and order a new one or 2 when spare gets to half fullsome companies won't ship this to hawaiino problem with this vendor"
"this will most definitely get the hair off you pet. I use it on my cat, the hair doesn't stop coming off, I comb her on each for about 15-20 minutes at least once a week. you will be amazed by how much hair comes off."
"Very warm for my dog, which is why I bought it! I can even put a sweater on her and then the coat if need be."
this product didn't protect my skin under the sun. I used once then threw it away!
"Camera did not come with batteries, and you need a eyeglass screwdriver to open the battery compartment. And of course screw is super duper small so you better keep track of it in able to but it back in."
This is my girlfriejd's favorite perfume. I overheard her mentioning she was running out. She told me typically it costs about $80 and that's why she was holding up on buying it. Saw this for a great price..and jumped on it. Shipped fast. Arrived even faster. The smile on her face made my day. THANKS!!!
"As popular as the infantry pack was is how this will be as well. If we wanted our cobras to be anything other than blue or grey, we had to paint them ourselves. well now we have the cobra night watch who guard the base at night from the joes. These guys look as good as the originals just with more darker colors. They come with many different weapons to choose from and if you wanted a good vehical for them to ride in, the night humvee is perfect even though its for the joes. an excelent to get as it will add more to the cobra troops with great troop building oportunities."
I have used this lotion for a few yrs now and just love it! I am so impressed with how FAST I received it. I just placed this order and had it withing a few days! That is what I call service! I also have found this to be the best price I have ever found it! Thanks Amazon!!
"I received these today and I cut my dogs nails with no problem. The protector stopped me from going to deep, as I have done before, and they did not need alot of pressure to work."
"I bought this clipper to replace one I wore out. They really do the job they are designed for. After having my horse shipped from Michigan in December,he had a full winter coat that needed to come off quickly. They accomplished it with ease. I would recommend them to everyone that needs to do a lot of clipping."
"I will lay her down and she will go through all three fifteen minutes settings, only fussing if we take to long to start it over. I wish the one I purchased had a remote, and I also wish that it worked with an adapter, because the battery gets used up real fast. Overall, very very happy with this product... that's both me and my daughter"
"My 3 1/2 year old son loves this game! It is very fun for him and easy for his age to play. My 1 year old loves the music that the goose plays, he dances to it every time! Very cute game, at a reasonable price."
"Being from the G1 era, this reissue is a very welcome addition to my collection as it will be to yours. A very durable toy with some awesome action possibilities, this third of three ""seeker"" reissues is arguably the best colored, even if it isn't the most well known of the three.I highly recommend this guy to anyone who likes tfs and everyone else as it is really fun to picture his teleportation ability (form the cartoon/comic series) and his incessant urge to follow the evil orders of Megatron. He is the perfect henchman. You might say my mind has been ""Skywarped"" by this guy..."
I love Jungle Gardenia but it is a bit expensive for me right now so I got this instead. I like it but not as much as Jungle Gardenia. It does smell good though. I recommend it.
"I use this to easily dry off dogs after a bath, it also really helps with shedding. (I have a german shepherd, they shed ALL the time). When using it, don't be afraid to put the tip of the precision nozzle up into their fur and use small, fast circles to blow out the most moisture and shed fur.Be careful using this on paws. Keep it away from the animal's face. In general, do not use it on extremities or areas with thin fur. If the dog has been shaved recently, do not use it on their bare skin. This is more powerful than a leafblower, be conscious of where you point it. If you drop the hose, it's going to look like an acme cartoon.I also use this for other things. I'm a computer geek, for example, and this can clean out a computer much faster than canned air can - and is actually safer because you have no risk of spraying refridgerant onto your components.Pros:-Multitasker-Two speeds-Does not get hot and burn the dog-Reduces shedding, can dry a dog off completely, and adds just the right amount of 'poof'.-Grounded so as not to create static and make long coated dogs' fur clingy (and it doesn't fry computer parts!)Cons:-Sort of loud, keep it as far away from the dog and you as you can.-Control ring on the nozzle feels cheap-Funnel attachment tends to blow off like a rocket, keep a hand on it at all times when you use it!-Misuse can very rapidly scare an animal for life.Other thoughts:-This is not a toy, but a very powerful tool. Don't let kids use it to dry the dog, ever.-Positive reinforcement is a good thing, have treats when you use it-Remember not to point it at ANY bodily orifices! Period!-Don't forget to clean the filter.-If you use it for computers, do so on mildly humid days. Do not do it where a bird can potentially 'bomb' the system. Do not do it indoors. Have the computer outside for no more than 5 minutes. If you're paranoid, loop a ground wire around the case of the computer and this thing's metal case, scratch the paint to insure a ground."
"This is the fastest that I have ever received a package. I was totally pleased with the how soon it came-they had estimated a week, but it arrived the next day. Was really happy!!!"
"I had read about this product so many times and could not wait for it to arrive! I have thick curly hair that tends to be too dry and frizzy on the ends and read great reviews and suggestions for use for this product as well as the defining/ texturizing creme ( which I also bought to use on my ends). I have tried it several different ways, on wetter hair, just damp hair and on drier hair and all I get is hair with no shine, very straw like and a bit tacky/ sticky. God I wanted to love this..."
This is the right length for the middle of the back. Many people asked me where I purchased it.
"My daugther got this ""baby"" when she was 8 months old & has been attached since. She recently lost it & was waking every night for it. FINALLY I went onto Amazon & found this replacement (the exact doll)....My daughter thinks her baby went away for a vacation & has come back. She is happier than ever and we are all sleeping all night again!!!This baby is a simple cloth doll but the love of my daughter's life...easy to wash and after many washes stays in great shape!"
"This is a great creamy lotion cleanser for all skin. Unfortunately for me, after using this for a few weeks I noticed little red bumps everywhere on my face. When I read the ingredients and saw that Soybean Oil was listed as a top ingredient it became clear. I am highly allergic to soy and soy products (even so-called sensitive Aveeno's soy-based line is a no-go for me...I can ONLY use their oat-based line of products). So, this product is a great natural alternative to cream cleansers, IF you aren't allergic to soy. Otherwise, stay away! I really like Juice Beauty Cleansing Gel and Cerave cleansers (both the foaming and cream cleanser are wonderful!) Otherwise, Earth Science is a great company!"
"I have a Shiba Inu who blows his coat twice a year. It is unbearable with all the fur he leaves behind. I purchased this product after seeing a video of it, and I cannot believe all the fur this product takes off. This is an amazing product."
"I have bought at least 3 of this same model. I use it every day so it has a life of about a year, which I think is normal. I did have a problem with the most recent one I purchased. The back of the handle (where the rubber seam is) gets extremely hot after only a few minutes. I've never had this problem before. I called Revlon, and they directed me to the manufacturer Helen of Troy 800-487-7273. They told me to just send it back and they would send me a new one!"
"I bought two and they are nice sizes. Fortunately, I wasn't picky about choosing the color, but that would have been a nice option to have. My dogs like to run around on it and it gets bundled up on the carpet. If it was heavier so that it does not easily fold and bundle, it would be perfect. Otherwise for the price, great deals."
"I think this is honestly the best lotion I've ever used- period. I work with harsh chemicals on a regular basis and they do horrid things to my skin. After a couple applications of this my skin is better than I ever remember. I've even noticed a reduction in the visibility of old scars! I wasn't expecting that, but I'm definitely not going to complain :) I also starting using it on my bikini zone after seeing the effect on my hands and WOW! I usually get unsightly shaving bumps due to the irritation of shaving and the skin in some areas gets really dry not anymore! It works just as well 'down there' as it does on my hands. I'm never buying another lotion."
"I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old. I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007. The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product. I supplement with one serving fromHolistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag.The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17. The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.) If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.I then split one can between all three twice a day. When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food. This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches, The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator. I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water. Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry. Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive. If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.With the free shipping, it is still a deal.Edit"
"I had been using these with much success for my cat for the last 8 months. He has to have seizure medication twice a day, and he loves the pill pockets. About 3 months ago, he started having chronic diarrhea that got worse and worse. The vet tested him for everything and did x-rays and tried multiple medications, but he still didn't get better. Than as a last thought, we decided to try to stop using the pill pockets completely and just giving him his medication in his food. Within 5 days, our cat was back to normal, and within a few weeks he wasn't dehydrated anymore and gained some weight back. I was very pleased with this product until I realized it was what was making my cat sick. I thought it might just be him, but I found other sites online where people had cited the same problem. I think this is a great product for help administering short-term medications, but I would make sure to monitor your cat if you are using them long-term. If your cat starts getting chronic diarrhea, these may be the cause."
We love it. It is perfect for our needs - dog food for 3 dogs!
This Is A Awsome Toy i already own 1 and im planning to own more
"My boyfriend bought this and he loves it, I think it smells pretty good and we found it for the cheapest price here yeyyyy"
"I think anyone into cologne or perfume has smelled this (assuming they haven't owned it) on at least a dozen others.Curve is the kind of scent you would expect to find littered around a college campus. Its a heavy synthetic smell, with a brutal starting point bubbling with artificial lavender and berry, and finishing to a warm but overbearing citrus and sandalwood base.Curve smells good if its applied extremely lightly, but this is never the case.The target audience would be young men ages 14-21. I bought my first bottle (the four ounce) when I was a freshman in high school, and I haven't been able to finish even half of the bottle through the years.Prospective buyers should definitely give it a test run."
"I bought this as a gift for my daughter, and we both love it. It actually leaves your hair very shiny - no dryness or hair damage. The steam makes great curls, and it's very easy to use. Highly recommend this to anyone!"
"I was skeptical at first when I bought this. You know how cats can be, usually happier with the box it came in than the toy itself. But right off my cat not only used the scratching pad, she also swatted the little ball around. AND she still uses it!"
My Grand Baby Loves this doll. The DVD is a Plus +++ (^_^)! Many Hours of Fun... She highly recommends this doll.
"I bought this about 3 months ago. It works fairly well for about the first month and a half, then it starts dying. It finally got to the point where it just clicks without moving. I called the customer service, who are supposed to be open until 8 EST. They weren't, so I called from work. The first time I called, they said that I needed the model number before they could talk to me. The person I talked to also said that they were open until 8, and that I could call when I got home. I told her that I had tried the night before, and she said that they were having phone problems that night. So, I went home, and tried calling again. Still not open after 6. So I got the model number, and called again from work. Mind you, each time you call, you have to wait for at least 10 or 15 minutes on hold until you get someone. I finally got another person, who told me that I now need the date code. So back home, check the date code, and call back during work again next day. ""Sorry, that's the wrong date code."" I needed to open up the cover for the computer chip and pull it out. The number was written on the chip in pen. I also took the unit apart to find out what was actually wrong with it. There is a cheap plastic gear inside the mechanism that got bent, and that is what was causing the problem. So, I called back today. Finally, they told me that I had to cut the computer chip off, and send that with a check for $10 to their company for shipping and handling, and they would send me a new unit. I asked for a supervisor, and was told that I was talking to one. I told her that the product is junk, and that the service is horrible. She said she was sorry to hear that, and I hung up. Don't waste your money on this product. There's got to be something better out there. By the way, email apparently doesn't work either...I sent one four days ago and never got anything more than an autoreply saying that someone would get back to me in 48 hours or less."
"Good product with the exception of the clips that hold the top to the bottom. Definitely get some wing nuts and screws to hold it together. After cleaning up the mess from the two parts popping apart for the second time, you have to do something. The manufacturer really needs to improve on this element of the design."
"ANY BODY WHO IS THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS BOX SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING POSTED ON 1/4/2011 BY BOBAROO, IT SAYS IT ALL, HANDS DOWN!5.0 out of 5 stars Best litterbox I have used hands down., January 4, 2011By bobaroo - See all my reviewsThis review is from"
"I must agree with the majority of the reviewers of BOD fragrances. You can't beat it for 7 bucks. I'm not a cologne expert or anything but I have owned a few ""good"" brand named fragrances over the years that I have paid 30 to $50 a bottle for a couple ounces. I must say the bod fragrances rank right up there in my book. A couple sprays and your good all day. Be careful with the large 8 oz. bottles because they have a really wide spray dispersal and you will smell too strong if you don't go easy with it. BOD is potent, but smells good if sprayed moderately (1 or 2 sprays for big bottle 2 or 3 for small bottle). Depending on the person you may have to spray more or less. If you are a regular working guy who wants to smell good and not spend $50 a bottle you can get 5 or 6 bottles of bod for the price of one brand named fragrance. I especially like Fresh Guy, Money, Black, Really Ripped abs, Rock Hard, Tekno in that order. I'm looking forward to trying their new fragrance Freshest Cleanest.Try one of these and you wont be disappointed."
the sqeaker barely squeaks so my dog doesn't even play with it. How hard would it have been to put a decent sqeaker in it?
"It really gets the hair off, but it seems to encourage more shedding. I'm not really sure. It could just be because its summer also. I know it hasn't really reduced the dog hair I'm vaccuuming up every other day or so."
"I ordered this crate to fit into a specific space, leaving a margin of error... it says its 30"" in length, but its actually a little longer - which means it doesn't fit and I have to return it. It looks like it would have worked. too bad."
really nice product for the initial cost ... just not very durable. costs $50 incl shipping & worked about ten times (about 5 min each time) before it died. so if you don't mind paying $1/min for your kids to fly a mini-chopper then you should buy it ... actually not a terribly bad deal in my opinion ... which is why i gave it 3 of 5 stars.
I think I got a fake davidoff. Both package and bottle are not what the images showed. You can tell just by seeing the package and bottle. Let alone the smell of perfume. No wonder why it's cheap! This is how you could expect from buying a cheap stuffs.
My chow chow loved me grooming him with this brush and usually doesn't like the fussing usually! Definitely a must for long hair undercoat dogs and dogs who don't like the groomers! with this tool I wont have to take him to the expensive groomers so much.
"I've been using this moisturizer for a few weeks now, and I'm just sorry it took me this long to try it! I have sensitive skin that doesn't react well to the stuff that beauty product manufacturers usually use in moisturizers, and this lotion has never caused any sort of bad reaction at all. It also does a nice job of diminishing redness and smoothing fine lines. I am completely addicted to it and will never use anything else on my face."
This is a card game that you can have a lot of fun playing from the beginning to the end of the game. In most games getting the most points is what you strive for. When you play this game you are to strive for the least amount of points (the winner). It's as must fun to be (the loser) because you actually got the most points.
"Satin is among the very, very (disappointingly) few hair colors that have a violet shade. It's named mahogany violet (labeled 4MV). It isn't outre (punky) at all, really it isn't. It looks like a nice dark brown but especially when in sunlight, there is a violet sheen. I considered using a drabber because I prefer ash tones, but I didn't want to get too fancy.Another good feature of this product is when mixed with developer it becomes the consistency of custard in 5-7 minutes so it doesn't drip, but it also doesn't squeeze out of those pointy applicators -- you must use a bowl and brush.For the first year or so that I've been using this hair color, I was pretty happy. Then I guess I got more grey hair so that now, it doesn't cover it anymore. I've tried increasing the proportion of dye to CG (as in 'cover grey') developer from 1:2 to 1:1, or even stronger; leaving it in way longer than the recommended 45 minutes... but as soon as I finish the coloring process, I can already see hairs and roots that are very, very light. The color fades within 2-3 shampoos even though it's supposed to be 'permanent' hair color.Maybe my coarse Asian hair is more resistant or some other special factor like that, but I would not recommend Satin to cover grey.If I have to color my hair every 2-3 weeks, I may as well go back to Wella's Color Charm semi-permanent color of Deep Violet (3V) andWella Color Charm Creme Developer - 30 Volume 16 oz. It is an actual black (not brown) but a level 3 so not as severe as 1. It only takes 20 minutes to process instead of the 45 that Satin takes, is less expensive and probably less damaging to my hair."
"I have sandy-red hair--now mixed with plenty of light gray at the crown, and around the face. Over 40 years ago, I started regularly using straight powdered henna (to intensify my red, and to add body and shine). About 3 years ago, I migrated to Surya dyes--first, out of curiousity (because I try anything *henna*), and then stayed with it, because of its terrific ease of use.For me, at least, the verdict is now in:The best thing about this product is how easy and quick it is to apply, and rinse out (compared with alternatives.)I mix this color with *Dark Reddish Blonde* and obtain a very natural-looking sandy red. Used by itself, it simply does not cover gray (unless you'd count a dusty yellow tinge. *Golden Brown*, um, no.) Any of the Red/Reddish colors (which do cover gray) will turn you into Ronald McDonald (with fading pinkish tones--ew!) when used alone.At this point, I have to apply every couple weeks--because, yes, a skunk line appears. I get some degree of boosted shine and softness--but this IS NOT A HENNA. Check the ingredients"
"For the money and the quality, this is by far the best facial cream yet! I have tried everything from Estee Lauder, Clinique to Clarins and I have been the most satisfied with the texture and results from Oil of Olay Regenerist Cream. Even the mild scent is pleasing! You will be HAPPILY surprised with the results, give it a try!"
"The Resident English Bulldog approves. She loves to go for a r-i-d-e (have to spell it out so she dosn't hear the ""word"") but it's always been a hastle in the car. Too much jumping around and unable to simmer down. Big distraction for the driver not to mention unsafe for a bull in a china shop (I mean bull in a Camry) to be tooling around town out of control. Scolding never worked. Those harness contraptions that loop over a seatbelt, no good. This Pet Kennel has changed everything. Pearl is comfortable and contained inside her mobile crate. Excellent air flow with lots of screen. The large model fits across the back seat of the car, leaving pleanty of room inside.The directions are vague, actually non-existant. I've found the retention straps hold the Kennel most solid when looped over the seat back. Looped over the seat belts it's too loose and shifts around the back seat too much. If your car has back seats that fold for access into the trunk it will be easy to install and remove. To hold it tight, you will need to run the strap up behind and over the top of the seat back. (This sounds worse than it is.)Oh yeah, almost forgot the best part. All the dog hair and associated slobber is contained and the inside of your car dosen't get trashed.Well made, well thought out. Does a great job of solving a persistent problem. Your going to love it.Note"
This has taken a great burden off my shoulders. I was so worried about my small pet traveling with me in the car. Now I can relax and he seems not to mind the restraints.
This is a great Cologne. Smells very clean and good. The only bad thing about it is it is very popular and many people have it and I kind of like to use something unique. But a great smelling cologne.
The Little People are slowly taking over our household. We wouldn't keep buying them if they weren't so cute and entertaining. The Surprise Sounds Fun Park hasn't let us down! My son loves playing with the roller coaster. He learned quickly how to set the monkey on the top and push a car down the roller coaster to make the monkey fall. The entire toy is very easy to use for small hands but not too simple that kids will get bored with it quickly. The only frustrating part of the toy is that the swing needs to be pushed rather hard to turn. I definately would recommend this toy to other parents.
"My previous 2 Flexi retractable leashes lasted 8 years with heavy use. I never expected the product to hold up so well. The spring mechanism never gave out, but after so many years of use and abuse, the nylon tapes began to fray. Still, even where one was partially chewed through, the tape still held.Ultimately, I decided it was time to replace them. The new ones are even better designed. They are larger and sturdier and have a feature that keeps the tape from getting stuck when it is being retracted. I have two 100 lb. rambunctious Labradors, and these are the best leashes I have ever bought. Real quality for the money. Also, this is the best price I was able to find. They are $48 each on the manufacturer's website. Truly an excellent product."
"I've been using the product for many years for my rescue rottweilers at the advice of my veterinarian, so at this point it is the best price that attracts me to one vendor over another"
My 12 year old cavalier tore both his ACL's and is too old for surgery. A friend told me about Comfort MSM. After 1 month my sweet old boy went from hobbling around so badly I thought I was going to have to put him down to being able to hop up on my bed and easily do the 3 stairs into the house without hesitation. I can't believe it!!! Comfort MSM has certainly extended the life of my best friend. Thank you!!!!
"My large breed dog has leg problems. He was so bad a couple of weeks ago he did not want to even get up. I started him on this product, and pain pills from the vet. I gave him pain pills for three days. Ever since then he get two Glyco-Flex in the morning. He takes them without fuss. He is like a young dog again. No more signs of pain. He jumps up in the window to watch the world go by and climbs stairs. He is one happy dog again."
My 5 year old daughter has really enjoyed this microphone. She sings on it often. It really works well in that you can hear yourself well. I do recommend this microphone because we have had others and this one does work the best!
"Our infant is only 9 days old, and he already seems to love resting in the Imaginarium. We're currently using it for &quot;tummy time&quot;, and when he is in there lying on his stomach, he stares intently at the black and white designs and mirror that surround him. He'll often stay in for 10-20 minutes at a time, which at this age seems like no small feat. Given that we have all hardwood floors, it's also perfect for our living room, giving us an easy place to rest him that is soft and comfortable. The fact that this toy is reversible and we can use the other side when he's a bit older makes it even more ideal. We'd definitely recommend it!"
"I heard rumors this scent was being phased out or discontinued, which I'm not sure are founded or true, but I love this perfume and wanted to make sure I had some. It has a pleasing, warm scent, with a hint of vanilla, spice, and musk. It's not heavy or strong. I don't like fresh, clean, floral, or super fruity scents and this is certainly none of those. It's a clean scent, but in a subtle way. This certainly is my favorite perfume of all time and I'm truly hoping Burberry does not discontinue it or alter it in any way!"
"I'm on board with everyone else. This game is very annoying as far as the noise goes. The makers of this game would be wise to shut the quacking down while still allowing the ducks to ""swim"" around the circle. But my 2 1/2 year old son loves it and understood the color matching right away. I do like how big the button (on/off switch) is, it's easy for him to shutthe game off by himself."
"I bought an imitation of this perfume and my girlfriend loved it. I bought this original perfume, now my girlfriend loves me. We are very happy."
"First the positive- this game is fun for young children. It encourages children to think a little bit as they land on places where they can jump to anywhere on the board. And, the kids do have to put a six piece puzzle together.Second, the not so positive- this game is not so fun for adults. There are other fun games that both kids and adults can play. This game is also very easy. VERY EASY for a four year old and yet four year olds are what the Dragon Tale game and show is supposed to be geared for, so there is not a good match there in my opinion.Basically your child will have a game token with one of the Dragon Tale characters on it. You spin a spinner and move your piece that many places. You land on some places where you get to pick a puzzle piece up and some you have to give up a puzzle piece. When you have collected your puzzle pieces together and made your puzzle work, you have won the game. There are only about four spots that provide you the opportunity to pick up a piece or lose a piece. Also, one spot lets you pick up three pieces at once and another spot lets you pick where you want to go on the board. So, depending on how the game goes- it can be over VERY quick or last a long time.There are some great games out there for young children. Penguin Pat is one we have enjoyed, Memory and others. This one is fine if yoru child LOVES Dragon Tales and will enjoy it because of the show connection. However, there are other games I'd get over this one.Enjoy."
"Sometimes being the youngest member of the family can be frustrating. Our three year old wanted to play Conga or Caddoo with us (parents and seven year old brother), but except for running off with the clay, she just wasn't ready.Enter Cariboo, a game made specifically for the preschool set with a key, brightly colored balls, and a treasure chest that opens once all the balls have been placed into the holder. This game has been great for helping with letter recognition and counting. It also aids with colors and shapes if your preschooler has not mastered them yet.The beginner level is quite simple, but luckily there is an ""advanced"" set of cards that expands the game to all letters and numbers 1-10. Parents will like that it is a teaching game, kids just like it because it is fun.Most important in our house; it made a three year old feel like a big girl with her very own Cranium game."
One of my dogs has a sensitive stomach and most rawhide products give him digestive issues. I have never had a problem with these though. They tend to last a while and are inexpensive enough to keep on hand regularly.
"This brush is just perfect. When you use it you get a good and comfortable grip which makes the grooming job a lot more pleasant. But that's not all, the cats find it great too. I have got ten cats, seven of whom have long hair and this brush is really ideal and effective doing a great job, gently removing dead hair and untangling the cats' coats. A five-star grooming item which I couldn't do without now, neither could the cats!!!!"
"I have natural dark brown thick hair, and have dyed it red with two chunks that I have bleached to a platinum level 9 blonde. The red when I do my roots always gets in the rinse and turns the platinum pink so I'm always re-bleaching. Obviously I have some very damaged hair in these areas. I decided I needed to get them red to alleviate further damage but they won't hold color. This product was supposed to be a miracle but I tried putting on hair first and mixing with color, neither worked the blond spots only came out a slightly darker pink.In the end I used a temporary semi followed by a veggi temporary dye and the pieces are mostly a solid red now. This product probably works great for normal or only moderately damaged hair but it didn't work for mine, which had been all but melted off with bleach.I've been coloring for 10 years now."
i love the flutterbut with music as it always captures the attention of my now 10 month old....i put in along his playpen and he always smiles and looks up...he also loves standing and reaching for the 'wings' ...he manages at times to pull off the wings and play with them as the music continues to play. he loves this and so do we.
"We travel with our 2 chihuahuas and we keep a pen in our van. It is great for visiting relatives and going to the beach. It keeps our dogs safe without always being on a leash. We have purchased 4 yards and have left them at different places we visit often. The pen is compact for storage and easy to set up. Reasonable price, fast shipping, and a better product than I expected."
"IT was my 1st time cutting my husband hair with this product. I thought I couldnt do it. He asked me to try the 1/4"" 1st. It was so easy to use. He then wanted his hair to be shorter, so I used the 1/8"". I didnt hurt his skin or anything at all. I am so confident on myself now. I buy an extra one for my mom to cut my papa's hair."
"Homer joins this elite group (&quot;The Stone Cutters&quot;), an obvious parody of the Masons. Number One wears an elaborate robe and headdress. He has a book with the official rules, a punishment paddle and a beer stein.Fabulously detailed - a must have for the Simpsons devotee and a fun gift for the Mason in your life with a sense of humor."
"Kenneth Cole, as we all know, is a master at creating the most captivating of scents. However his ""eau de toilette"", Black, is the most luxuriously sexy scent. Black offers a woman the scent of sensuality, love, and overall hotness. To sum it all up, Black is just sexy."
"I love this lotion, or as it's called emulsion. It's the one lotion that keeps my skin moisturized. I have had skin issues since I was a child, with excema and allergies that sometimes cause breakouts so I need a lotion that is delicate and sensitive. I have tried other lotions throughout the years, but even though they say they are for dry skin or sensitive skin, most end up drying out my skin, and my feet and elbows feel like emery boards. Not this one. What I like most is that it keeps the bottom of my feet and my elbow soft and supple. I have to say that sometimes it is even soothing. As I said, I love it."
i just bought this for my daughters 3rd bday and she loves it. the grafics are good considering that its just a plug in and play game. good quality though. the games are easy enough for her to understand and its already midnight and i still cant get her off. i would recomend this to any parent. also teaches shapes and matching plus taking turns and sharing. it has a built in board game..
"I have been using proactive for the past two years, and I liked it, but I wanted to see if I could find a cheaper substitute. This neutrogena set was a really good combo and kept my face looking good, but after two weeks it started drying my skin out. I had to incorporate stronger moisturizers to help compensate, and my face broke out in the process. I have very sensitive skin that dries out easily. I don't think I would suggest this set to people who have a problem with benzoyl perozide because my face had the same reaction to that."
"First, these blocks are 1 3/4--1.75--inches tall/square. That is an excellent size. On one side is embossed the capital letter and border design, and the lower case of the same letter is embossed with a border design on the opposite side.Each block is all the same color--they come in dark colors of red, blue and green. The designs of images starting with the letter--same letter as embossed on two sides of the block--are the same color, and very neat and distinct. They include a picture and a name for each design/side. They are very interesting to look at.The tray is not as tall as the blocks, which makes it easier to reach in and remove a block. There are also two block spaces empty, which helps with removing one, too.This is a GOOD set of alphabet blocks. I am pleased with them."
"The system works as advertised, but my dog doesn't seem to be bothered by the citronella by the spray. It's just not very effective with my Aussie."
"Being used to playing Classic RISK, this game seemed a big complicated when I first started reading the rules. However, after you read the rules and play 1 game, you will be familiar with how the game works and the added complexity of the game introduces VERY new strategies.Those that are familiar with Classic RISK will, at first, think that Godstorm is a complete free-for-all, laden with luck. It will appear that there is much less strategy and much more luck. After playing this game many times though, the astute strategist will realize that there is indeed a lot of strategy involved in RISK Godstorm, and that it is not as much of a luckfest as it might first appear to be.For example, if you never played before and didn't know that the Death Card ""Sink Atlantis"" was out there, you might have all your forces massed in the continent of Atlantis and then suddenly in a blink of an eye be completely demolished from the game. If you knew that the card existed though, and knew that your opponents knew the card existed and so they were scared to take Atlantis, you might easily take and hold Atlantis with a small number of forces (while your main forces work on another continent). You might also summon your God of Death if you hold Atlantis, and try to work on the Death Card stack, hoping to draw the ""Sink Atlantis"" card yourself and give yourself some safety from being sunk. However, you still don't want to mass too many forces there and you probably want to mumble something about how bad your cards are and how worthless they are, because if you act happy about the card you drew and then start massing forces in Atlantis, the other players will know that you drew the Sink Atlantis card (if they are smart). Then if they draw the card that allows them to look at and take another player's cards... you're in TROUBLE!This is just 1 of many examples, but a lot of strategy in Godstorm comes from knowing what cards are out there and playing your cards properly. This element of strategy is non-existent in the Classic RISK. Another example"
"The deal is, you have this neopet you have to take care of. You need to feed it about three times a day and they like to play with their toys. You also have to make sure your neopet doesn't get sick (this will hardly ever happen if you feed it enough). You play games to earn neopoints and you use the points to buy things for your neopet.This game has a few flaws. It gets boring pretty easily and there isn't much you can do with your neopet. All you do is feed it a few times a day and earn neopoints. I would say that if you want to buyit, you should. If you're not sure whether to buy it or not, don't. A game that is better than this is"
"Driger F is so wicked awesome!It's speed is so strong, even the most powerful Beyblades can't keep up with it's vicious assault! It has got awesome endurance, and an amazing attack! It doesn't have very good defense, but its so fast that most of the time, Blades can't get close to it to attack!"
Great product. My only issue was where to tear the bags. In the dark it was a little difficult to find the perforation. Overall I love them. Will order again.
this product did absolutely nothing for my ingrown hairs in my bikini area. there was no change let alone improvement. I basicallyy wasted my money.
"We bought this for our son for his first birthday and he just loved it. It has to be put together exactly as described, it took me a couple tries, but we have had no trouble at all with it since. He loves to hear the music and try to figure out where the balls are going to come out next. He is 21 months now and still loves the toy. It is very sturdy and he's never fallen or been able to take it apart. Well worth the purchase!"
"I rarely review anything I get, but I had to write something on this product. My cat was overweight, not obese, but he probably wasn't too far away from the cut off between the two. He is strictly an indoor cat and middle aged, so he does not get much exercise. He also had a bowl of food out all the time and could eat at will.When he started to get fat a while ago, we switched him to a weight loss formula food. This did not help much, especially with our feed at will system. I switched to feeding him twice a day, but whenever he got the food, he would just garbage it down with his face and paws in the bowl (cat version of binge eating).In a last resort effort to take some pounds off the cat, I decided to buy the SlimCat ball. It is just like a mini version of a hamster ball (as other people have noted). I put his natural, weight management food in the ball and feed him with it twice a day. He figured out how to use it right away, so we only needed the small holes to release the food. The ball is easy to use, made well (it has survived a young kid throwing it down the hall like a play toy), and the cat seems to enjoy pawing at it to get the food out. I like that he has to move around a little - opposed to the old ""face and paws"" in the bowl version of feeding. Also, since he gets very excited every time the ball comes out, before I give it to him I take about 7 or 10 pieces of food and throw them down the hall one at a time. Since he is hungry, he goes chasing after them (my way of making him workout before his meal). Then I shake the ball (which he comes running to now) and give it to him to push around.He has easily lost about 2-3 pounds within a month using the SlimCat/weight management food/and a little added exercise chasing the food down the hall. I highly recommend this system. I bought a second one, fill them both in the morning, and use one as the morning feeding ball and the other one as the evening feeding ball.This ball is worth every penny, especially if you consider the fact that it probably helped save my cat from becoming diabetic (and yes, they can become diabetic). That alone makes it worth its weight in gold. :)"
Brought this along with a bunch of other games on a week long vacation. It was by far the most played game the whole time. Easy to learn and so much fun.
"My son got this over a year ago (Christmas 2004). He was 6 months old. He didnt play with it yet although we had it available and we did it for him. As he got older he'd play more and more. He is 21 months old (almost) and he LOVES IT! He carries it around the house and knows the songs and noises they make ans smiles so huge at it.I love how its not negative. You dont ever do something wrong... you just do something silly. I love that positive reinforcement!It still works perfectly. In fact I replaced the batteries for the second time yesterday. Yup... Its played with A LOT during the day and its batteries were only replaced 2 times in over a year! You cant say that about many toys!my next son (due in June) will hopefully get to use the same one and if need be, we'll buy another one because this is a great toy!"
This works great. The cat was eliminating liquid through the hole during the first week. And the solids can be pushed through using a standard scooper. Even at that point it is less mess than a litter box.Still within two weeks the can was using the toilet and no more kitty litter. However beware as this particular cat only uses that particular toilet where the training happened so if you leave the bathroom door closed it could mean trouble.
"I purchased this item based on customer reviews. They were all good, ALL seemed to be 5 stars. When I received the game and played it with the bunch of women I play games with every Saturday night, we ended up closing the game midway through. Most of the questions were too simple. For instance, almost all of one of the catagories cards read something like this"
"This is a product I can't live without. This was the absolute best deal I could find, and the product arrived in only a few days."
the dogs love this product and the price is very reasonable...packaged well and easy to use...will continue to get this for the pets
"This toy lasted two seconds with my older German Sheperd who is not a big chewer. We were looking for a softer toy to encourage her to chew but she just descimated this. Then, we got another one for our Great Dane puppy and the same thing happened. No good. Get for ancient dogs or don't bother."
"This toy is awesome and highly recommended! My 11 month old son got it for Christmas and loves it! The pieces are easy to put in, when my son pushes it just slightly the song plays, and it has volume control. I absolutely love how mixing two different animals creates a new one. It rewards them for the effort and gives correct information at the same time. Even my 5 year old likes playing with it. If I could give 10 stars I would."
"I loved this game as a child and still do as an adult! My husband even likes it and he's not a real game-guy. Don't know why it cost $[...]+ at the stores, though!"
"My wife must have bot 4 packs of these for the grandkids, and they really have a ball w/ them."
Love these brushes. I have one in every bathroom and one in every bedroom of the house. I have two daughters with long thick hair and this is the only way to brush through it without screaming and drama. Couldn't live without them.
I threw the stable and acc. away after days of trying to put together for my girls. It is trash! The pony is cute and my girls do play with it but not worth your money. They should not be aloud to sell this crap! It is wrong to sell something that they know good and well doesn't work. Not happy with wasting my money on this.
Product worked as advertised once I managed to get it working. I had to play around with battery insertion for a while before it turned on. It does show the new and the cleaned old dog urine spots. It definitely showed me carpet will need to be replaced soon.
"I was using this when I had long hair. My hair is naturally curly and tend to explode, but this iron kept my hair straight even on rainy days. I rarely used the wavy shaped plates, but the wuffled style was sometimes fun."
Frontline Plus for Dogs 3 Mths 89-132 LbsI have tried other brands and nothing compares to Frontline.This is the best price I have found.
"This blade rocks it cut trought a thick piece of cardboard i mean the ones that the ones that the computer games come in, broke the box and cut trought it right after i built it.If u want the perfect blade put this attack ring on dragoon storm's base, spin gear, and weight disk.look at the stats poster and look it up as i just told u, it makes the ultimate beyblade it beat my friend's bakushin-oh and sister's dranzer s everytime we fought. IT IS UNBEATABLE."
"After reading the reviews here I was very excited to order L'Oreal's Professional Series Absolut Repair Masque (I also ordered the shampoo/conditioner.) I've been using all three products for four days now and I haven't noticed any different in my hair whatsoever. I have VERY dry hair. It's frizzy, and extremely prone to breakage. Previously I was just using TRESemme shampoo/conditioner and a spray leave-in conditioner, and I think that combo worked just as great as this line of products. However, TRESemme is significantly less expensive. I wouldn't reccomend this line."
Got this for my 3 month old Dobie so that she would stay out of the cat food. I love it! it was easy to assemble and is doing very well at keeping her out and letting my cats have the freedom they deserve
"This cologne was great. I love the subtle slight sweet smell. It is very masculine yet very subtle. It's my top 5 favorite cologne. Make sure to get the eau de parfume version. It last waaaaay longer and is worth the extra $10-$20. It's great for cocktail parties, black tie events and even heading to your local club. Ladies will flock, I promise!"
i bought this for my wife last christmas for like 60 dollars and it was worth it. now its 29 thats great!!!
I have used both cheaper and more expensive shampoo but have found that I always come back to Biolage. It is a great product.
"I love it because it's vegan, my cat loves it because it's good. I've never seen a cat so happy to be fed before, he reminds me of a dog sometimes. He loves this food, and I'm glad that he is eating healthy and that he's happy."

"I bought this for my daughter who was just 16 months old at the time. When I brought it home and opened it up I was surprised to see that the Magnetic Letter holder could either go on the fridge or you can mount it on a wall. We decided to put it on the fridge, and it never fails that everytime one of us is in the kitchen our daughter comes and plays with her letters. I love this product because it teachs how to sound out the letters when the child puts a letter into the magnetic holder and it sings the ABC song when you push the music note. There are 2 different sound levels also, soft but not too soft and high. There are four different colors, red (Vowels), yellow, green and blue. Our daughter is already at 18 months starting to learn her ABC's and say those colors names.I highly recommend this product!!"
"This mat works perfectly, but it does seem though that my dog has figured out that when the mat isnt there physically, she knows that it wont shock her then so she goes back to doing what she was doing before. so the mat has to stay there permenantly looks like."
This is the only thing that's helped my miniature schnauzer learn to be quiet. It doesn't go off too easily. It lets her bark softly. It worked immediately.
"We tried three other kinds of dog door before we got our first staywell. We've now bought three of them (none of them have broken, we just have several dogs and foster from our animal shelter so we needed various sizes). They keep out drafts and rain much better than the other styles we tried (2 flexible flap doors and one rigid flap) because of the way the panels overlap. They are designed to be installed in a door, and the installation is very simple. Two of our doors are actually installed in our walls instead (a little harder, depending on your siding type, but still doable). The only downside is that the door makes a fairly loud clacking sound when a dog runs through and that makes it take a little longer to train timid dogs. I would strongly recommend these doors to anyone."
"This product really works to give you a very dark tan without the sun. Since I am a Florida snowbird for six months out of the year, I use this product to maintain a dark tan throughout the entire year. I usually get a base tan with the sun and then apply the product to maintain a very dark tan throughout the year. You really have to wash your hands after you apply the dark lotion. I recommend washing your hands with a dolby sponge to rmove all the dark residue so the plams of your hands will not tan or turn brown.The color is not artificial orange; it provides a deep dark natural looking tan. I have received complements. Today a woman approached me saying that I look like a Ken Doll because I had such a dark tan.I recommend this product and will use it again."
"I know people have said that the weak point of this product is that the handle breaks easily, so we're being careful with that. In all other ways this product does exactly what we needed. Our border collie's very thick undercoat came out easily without discomfort for him. On the contrary, he behaves as if he is getting the best massage of his life. It's hilarious! He loves it. We also have long-furred cats for whom spring is usually a misery of shedding and hairballs. One tends to get bad tangles and matts in her fur. Let me tell you--all of them like this rake and it gets the undercoat quickly and easily so they will be cooler, more comfortable, and less prone to that horrible ACKACKACK I'm-gonna-stain-the-carpet announcement all long-fur-cat owners dread. I myself use a CPAP at night and the straps in back of my hair tend to give me tangles in my super-fine hair. I resorted to trying this on myself a couple of days ago. It's a bit embarrassing to admit but it took MY tangles right out without pulling or discomfort. Honestly, if I had to go through raising little girls again, I'd want one of these to get the tangles from their hair. The tears and conflict over hair brushing would be gone. It flat-out works and works quickly and I'd bet it would work on any kind of hair, including any human hair. They should make and market a version for little girls whose mothers do battle every morning on tangled hair and tender scalps."
"I used it for a few weeks, and did not see any difference in the cellulites."
This is a great product. It brought out the creativity and humour in all of us. I haven't had a good belly laugh like this in a long time. Great for family/friends of diverse ages.
This Buzz is wonderful... have so many phrases and laser with light and sounds. My son is playing all day.
"Well I got my bottle of Curve today along with another couple of colognes on the ""So you'd like to...start wearing cologne"" guide on amazon that I have been purchasing by. With all my newfound knowledge about cologne history, perspective, and opinions, I used these colognes to give an informative speech this evening in my public speaking course, complete with all the bottles present. I sprayed CURVE onto myself when it arrived, and now I am comparing all of the new scents to my favorites so far, HUGO and CANDIES. My impression was that it was more serious than Hugo, had a sweetish overtone combined with musk, and then there was sort of a greenish bitter forest type scent to it that I wasn't crazy about. I think I may have been dissappointed at first, but that soon changed. After about fifteen minutes the smell got to be really good and the elements I hadn't liked were gone or had matured into subtle forms that went well together.After the speech I allowed the class to sample all of the colognes, and Curve was commented on the most, followed by Drakkar, then Hugo. All of the women liked it and seemed to have great associations with it, and for that I have to ensure that it gets the full 5 stars. I continue to wear it now later this same evening and it has quite grown on me.If you only bought Curve as your main cologne, you'd be quite alright. Subtle enough for casual wear and bright enough for clubbing. Overall good mix."
Love rogaine. It works very well. The foam form is the best. I bough 1 year supply and use it religiously twice a day.
I ordered the Frownies pads for use on forehead and between brows. Instead I got a half filled box of some kind of undereye gel pads. Not what I wanted. I've decided to keep them and use them but I ham very disappointed not to have gotten the frown pads.
"Plush, attractive and durable but also light in weight and very well designed. Easy to clean (machine washable) and store. It is non-skid on the underside which makes it perfect for any flooring. I purchased the medium size for my 8 month old shih tzu but I am tempted to get the jumbo size so I can sit on it with her. I hope this item will always be available."
"Now. brushing is a treat for the dogs, I use this on my dachshund and Pit Bull, it was before very hard to get them to let me brush, now they stand in line and drool!"
terminated the fur!! Rids the pet of all the dead undercoat leaving only soft shiny fur and no shedding for weeks! This is great!
This game is great for all ages. I have purchsed them for twenty-somethings and those young at heart (80+). Makes you think and plan ahead. Great Game!!!
"I agree with a previous reviewer that this toy is best for a medium-sized dog. The goose is a little plump so it's harder for a smaller dog to squeak it. I have a medium-sized dog and his specialty is ripping the squeaker and stuffing out of toys. I continue to purchase the AKC toys because they are more realistic looking (rather than crazy, brightly colored toys). If you're dog is a ""killer"" these AKC toys are very easy to tear apart, but luckily they're cute and fairly cheap so I don't mind. If your dog is the opposite and never tears squeakers out then this toy is even better."
"This figure looks awesome when you look at the fig on the box cover. The disappointment comes upon opening the box. The size of the fig is too small for me to fully appreciate it. The painting is top notch and the pose of the figure is really hot but her 'shushing' hand is not aligned with her lips! If you're brave enough, you can customize the fig yourself. I had to modify the fig's hand by removing it from the wrist and gluing it back on just to match the box cover.Customizing tip:To remove the hand, use the boil-and-pop technique.File off any excess porcelain from the hand's stump.Glue the hand back on using a smidgen of slow setting glue so you can still reposition the hand closest to what's shown on the box (ceramic epoxy will do). Enjoy customizing!"
"This is the best perfume ever -- I get more compliments about it than any other scent I wear, which is really impressive at $6 a bottle. When people ask what it is, I always say Chanel no. 11 -- no one ever guesses my little secret."
"This is a great game for new readers and for readers who need some extra help and practice. As a retired teacher and now a tutor, I'm using this with a second grader who is having trouble with reading. She really enjoys this game and is getting much better at spelling short words, as well as recognizing longer words because of the skills she is learning with this game. I'd recommend this to anyone with a young reader! P.S. It can also be used with older readers just as a fun game by having a time limit to make a certain amount of words."
"Great! Easy to assembly, dissassemble, easy to clean, spacious, and very attractively priced in comparison to local alternatives."
"I use a ScoopFree automatic cat box with the replacement cartridges. I have two cats who constantly use the box. With adding some of these crystals to freshen up the box once or twice per week, I can easily let the box go over a month between replacement. Just make sure you use the real ScoopFree boxes, not the LitterMaid made for ScoopFree that all of the store sell now - they leak urine through.These are also perfect size for the rake on the ScoopFree box."
"This witch hazel toner is 1/3 the price I usually pay for other facial toners. I When I saw this I was literally astounded. They're so cheap and affordable ($2.99 for a 16 fl oz bottle at my local Walgreen), not to mention it works fine. This soothes my acne prone irritated skin after I remove my make-up at night. It doesn't dry out my skin despite the fact it contains 14% of natural grain alcohol. Witch hazel is also great for acne. Besides, you should really apply less of chemical ingredients if your face is breaking out and start going natural. There's no added artifial fragrance either but I found the smell to be very fouling, but I can't really complain. This should last me a long time and I'll keep on buying this product unless there aren't going to be any change in ingredients and price."
"Durable and does a good job. Aftyer purchasing and using the first one, I bought three more. That should tell you they are worth the $$$"
"The toy is adorable , it taught my 4 month old to recognize twinkle twinkle little star. But it came strapped down with plastic bands that have left holes and the filling keeps coming out besides this one problem it's perfect it helps me put my son to bed."
I bought this for the neighbor. They take it to restaurants to pass the time with a 5 year old and say it is fun for the child.
"I use a soft crate to hold my 65lb Lab and my 26lb Blue Heeler at agility trials. This crate replaced a torn BP Backyard Pet crate that I'd used for 5 years and could nolonger find. Having used the Firstrax N2-36 several times now I'm sorry I bought it. There is an unpleasant chemical smell in it, and it doesn't seem any better built than my previous crate whick cost about half the price. The lack of a mesh section on top and better re-inforcement at the bottom of the front and side is dispointing."
Spell Time is a fun way for children to practice using the letter sounds to spell words. The self-correcting feature gives them instant feedback. The success they have with Spell Time helps to improve both their reading and writing skills. The instructional assistant who helps in my kindergarten classroom uses it with my struggling students and we've seen great progress.
Have purchased the same version in the smaller magnets for my grandkids and they worked great. This is one time that bigger is not better. They are two heavy to build up high. The magnets are not strong enough to hold them up. They work great if you just attach one to another on the floor. If you try to build up with them they are just two heavy and keep falling. This is one of those times that you should stick to the smaller sticks these so not cut it. They were quite a disappointment.
"Haven had issues for years with my skin, used this product for 3 weeks and I keep getting compliments!!!! One thing I found was if I put it in a little squeeze travel container it was easier than a pump. Also I do agree, it smells really bad but only for a minute. AWESOME PRODCUCT!"
This is the 2nd bottle I've owned...the first bottle was smaller in size...great price and I love this fragrance; always get compliments on it...
"I got my Omega Paw on Friday after using a make shift litter box from a huge Sterilite Container that I had cut open for the purpose. After seeing the video and reading some reviews about it I figured I'd be able to save some time from scooping and having my cat Buddy clawing at me while I scooped his poo.The packaging was deceptively small - for a while I thought they had delivered the wrong thing. Then I realised it did not come assembled. The assembly wasn't that hard - instructions on the box was simple enough and as Buddy occupied himself playing with the box it came in I was able to put together the Omega Paw in less than 2 minutes. The immediate thing I noticed though was the quality. Whilst the plastic it is designed with makes for an exceptionally light weight product- easy for even a frail arthritic 92 year old granny to turn/ flip over- it also does not make for a very strong product. As I was pressing the grill into place in the little snaps I could see the plastic grill bending with the least amount pressure that I was applying. Neither did the plastic grill lock completely into place as I had expected it should - which is probably why some litter always makes its way into the scoop tray.Additionally the pins are plastic and not at all durable. Thankfully I haven't had to open it since I bought it but I have my doubts about the durability of the pins, as again - they seem to be manufactured of cheap plastic and feel as if they would break if too much pressure is applied in moving them.Moreover, it doesn't completely remove all of Buddy's doo doo... I find myself still having to use his old school scooper to pick up pieces left behind. Maybe I'm not flipping it right? But isn't it supposed to be so deceptively simple that all I'd have to do is flip it? So how the heck could I not be flipping it correctly? Or is it that my cat's poo is so super that it's impervious to the science behind the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box?Finally, and this is more about my preference than anything - the regular size is a lot smaller than I had anticipated it would be. Buddy's a 9 month old kitty but he's already tall and lanky. I ought to have gone with the Large size to give the guy more room to do his business, especially after the large sized make shift container he used before, but still, he manages. To his credit, he didn't need to be re-trained to use this litter box and to the credit of Omega Paw the entrance is suitably high enough so that when he's scratching away at the litter not much gets tossed outside at all.I'd have given this product 2 1/2 stars but Amazon doesn't give me that option - so I decided to be generous and round it off to the nearest star- hence a 3 star rating. All in all it's a wonderful concept, but maybe a better quality material ought to be used and maybe whatever design flaw there is that still allows clumped litter to remain in the box after the flip could be rectified."
I bought these replacement magnets for my cat and his door because he lost the one that came with it. Works great and attaches to collar easily . He is very happy he can come and go as he pleases and I don't spend my day letting him and out.
ampro is really good because it holds it will not like the other ones that u need a lot to look good GIRLS LOVE IT TRUST ME
Dog loves them. Great replacement from her regular treats before she became diabetic. Our dog also got SARDS which left her blind. She is 10 years old and other wise in good health. So this product really helps her quality of life.
"For those who haven't started using this well known supplement, come up to the next level. You'll know it works after about a week. Excellent sleep without grogginess in the morning, and you really will wake up and know it worked to boost Test as well. If your training hard enough, you gotta start using it."
"Southwest sun can take its baking toll on hair unless you're wise and usually wear a hat. (I'm not wise and I don't really care for hats. Every once in a while there's an errant breeze during the summer months, and it feels good touching and lifting your hair) Now, I've accepted the blame for often dry lackadaisical locks, what's the solution?For me, Fekkai's Glossing Cream with its addition of pure olive oil delivers shine, hydration and manageability. It comes in the trademark Fekkai tube (easy to squeeze with wet hands).Since my hair is fine and fly-away it works best for me if I rub a small amount between my palms on towel dried hair and stroke through. Then I repeat the process after blow drying and before styling.It's incredibly light yet effective. Fekkai is simply the finest!"
"My son saw the TV add for this toy several weeks ago and I went and bought it at a local retailer for him for Chrirstmas. (My wife and I do not like to wait to the last minute). I was looking around online yesterday and came across the reviews of the toy on Toys R Us and was a little concerned about the review posted saying that the toy was a failure. That is the last thing I need on Christmas day! So I took it to work with me this morning to see if there is any problems. (I work at a local Porsche Garage) After a complete charging the toy worked great! Like everyone says the flatter the surface the better. All the guys at the shop were very impressed with the design and engineering that went into creating this toy. That hard part was getting it away from the guys so it would not be all scratched up before I could give it to my son. So, I am glad I tested the toy in advance and it seems to work great, I am glad I bought it I am sure it will be a hit. And, no it did not mark up the walls."
"I decided to give this a try based on the good feedback. On the positive side, my 50 pound lab loved this toy. Unfortunately, the tail was ripped off and the the monkey was disemboweled in a matter of minutes. If your dog is an adept chewer I recommend the Coleman or Kong material toys."
"I bought this cat door because my 2 cats have their food, water and litter boxes in the basement and didn't want to continue leaving the basement door open. The installation was super easy. The door itself is a basic cat door with no bells and whistles. Once my cats got used to going through it, they like it. Its also a safe zone for them from my dog. My one cat is near 15 pounds and she easily fits through with no struggle. That was my main concern as she is a pretty large cat. The only complaint I would have is the actual swing door sticks a bit so the cats had a small problem getting through. We took off the swing door and just have the frame of the door on and now it works great. I would recommend it if you are not looking to spend too much."
"The lotion is easy to use and seems to soak into my skin quickly and hydrate my skin all day and night. It however just smelled like lotion and nothing more. I have the perfume, lotion and body gel. The perfume is wonderful, the body gel is ok with a light scent, but this lotion had no scent, other than the smell of the basic lotion smell."
The dogs in my pet sitting business love this toy. #1 most popular especially with smaller dogs. They love to carry around/hold the squirrels for hours and take them to bed. Much more than other small furry toys so there's something about the shape or appearance I think. I give this as gifts. Even an old St Bernard loves it.
"What can I say? It's just an AC adapter for some of the retro coin-op style games from Jakks Pacific so you can get your 80s-style, old skool, ghostchompin' hard rock on.Don't be too concerned with some of the other reviews, this thing isn't as bad as all that. Fits snugly into the battery compartments of the two games that I own - the Pac & Misc. and the Ms. Pac & Misc. Took about a minute or two playing with it before it snapped into position. No muss, no fuss. More importantly - no more dad-blasted batteries!"
"I started wearing First many years ago. I received it as a gift, I believe, from my father. I love the softness of the fragrance. It's not too overpowering and always makes me feel feminine and classy. When it was no longer available at my favorite stores, I thought I had lost out on yet another one of my favorite scents (I was a teenager in love with Tuxedo) but thanks to speciality distributors like this one and Amazon.com, I am once again enjoying the fragrance of First."
No matter how much litter was put on top of these liners our cat ripped them up every time. Not worth the trouble.
there aren't many Georges to choose from. My daughter liked this. She takes good care of it and looks like it'll be durable.
"The best learning toy I ever bought my son. It is a must for every family with preschool and school age children. Daycares must have this toy! Leapster made his first reading experience enjoyable Just in few weeks my son is capable to read simple lines, this is a great educational toy!It's easy to operate and really lets children play and learn at the same time. I'm so happy to see my kid improving his reading and phonics skills using this well-structured interactive toy and playing with his favorite characters."
"people,come on...the truth of the matter is, i wanted a way to get my five year old son into battle and adventure games so i saw this thing marked down and grabbed it.i couldnt believe the amount of men and troops when i opened the lid, that stuff makes me get goosebumps. i do agree of course that my superglue was out in less than 5 minutes repairing broken spear handles and lances that broke off way to easy, but again i revert to my '[the price] nuff said' title.as far as gameplay, my five year old picked this up within minutes, and can actually give me a good challenge in a fun kind of way. i think the battle system is RISK like but even more interesting, axes and arrows instead of pips.there is a lot more going on that chess, and its more visual and gives the sense of battle.i find it hard to believe that a couple of master axis and allies players would purchase this game for [the price] and sit down expecting to be thouroughly engaged in mind bending strategic combat for hour long tourneys...lets look at this game at its face value, and the crowd it appeals to...MAXIMUM bang for the buck!"
"I was thrilled to find a barrier that I could use with bucket seats. At first I had a hard time getting it to stay in place. Eventually I figured out a little trick. If I pull the barrier towards me and adjust it just a little higher, tighten the knob and then push it into place it's snug enough to stay put. Trying to adjust the height while in place is nearly impossible to make it tall enough to stay in place. The only thing I would change about it is make the top tube just a few inches wider to make less of a gap between the seats. The price is very reasonable. This barrier has definately helped make driving to the dog park safer for me. The dogs stay in the back seat where they should be! If you spend a little time working with it so it's the correct height it should stay in place."
"My Husky puppy LOVES these !! They are the perfect size for training. Even though they are small, I still usually cut them in half to get a longer training session."
"Great crate, easy to clean and roomy. Easy to assemble and moveabout. Pet loves the open air effect. Removable floor a plus."
"This item arrived in a large outer box, floating with no inside bag or packaging. It consists of the top and the base, solid plastic, which fit together fine.My major complaint with this item is that it does not include the front door, which is most likely just a piece of rubber that would fit into the two holes and swing. For the price, it should be included.Also, the measurements led me to believe that the MEDIUM Lectro-Kennel heating pad would fit perfectly....but it does not...you will need the SMALL size.Otherwise I am satisfied so far, and Homie is breaking it in nicely."
"My daughter, Maggie, just loves this toy. The hippo lives in her stroller and it goes wherever we do. I love that it has so many different components...bright colors, black and white patterns, textures, sounds. You name it and the hipppo has it! A great all-in-one toy."
"I had to write a review on this terrible product. They cost twice as much as the walmart or supermarket brand and leak. I have a 5 pound pomaranian who uses pads while I am at work because their bladders are so small. Even the smallest amount of wetness goes right through.Shame on Natures Miracles for making an inferior product. Don't buy, the cheaper brands work so much better."
"I purchased 2 small dog rhinestone collars, that could have been mailed in an envelope but instead were mailed in a huge box and I was charged $9+AND the collars were garbage. Within 3 days 7 rhinestones had fallen out of one of the collars. 3 DAYS!!!! And this on a little lap dog!!!! I will never EVER buy from KAKADU again."
This toy is still getting lots of mileage even though we've been walking for months. This was a gift to our son and one of the best he's received. It really encouraged him to walk and the balls and music are great motivators for him. He learned how to punch the nose and make music to his delight. Then he figured out where the balls were coming out. Huge satisfaction for a toddler. Great choice!
"Our family loves this game. It was a bit discouraging for the children at first because they kept being required to identify countries they'd never heard of, but the more we played, the more they learned, and now they know most of the countries. However, even after they've learned to identify all the countries (and there are a lot, some even I didn't know!), then we can make it more challenging by asking them to name the capitals. There are also blank cards so we can make up a few of our own postcards. It is true that the map is a little small, but this didn't really affect the educational or entertainment values of the game. We didn't play it non-stop when we got it so maybe that's why we didn't master so quickly and then get sick of it. We play it occasionally and always enjoy it."
"I just recieved this figure from Amazon today.Here is the review:This is the second NY Islanders Sportspick. The first one was Chris Osgood.This is for display only so it dosn't get much of a large rating for how fun it is unless you have fun staring at it.This is educational because you learn about legendary players on the Islanders during there dynasty years.I will also add that this has a new base mold. Instead of the older NHL series SP's that have a sticker with there name and the teams logo it has the name of the player painted on the base.If you are a fan of the Islanders I say this is a must buy if you have been a fan your whole life or just a few years like me.Hopefully TMP will make Al Arbour, and Clark Gillies in the future sometime."
"I was afraid to expect too much, but I shouldn't have been. There was an issue with the long hair from my Golden Retriever, but I found a solution. I trimmed off the teeth of the clipper guide. Her hair was so tangled no amount of brushing would remove the old winter coat, so as bad as I hated it I had to remove almost all of it. By trimming the teeth off the cutting guide I was able to get a very close cut without hurting her. I'm surprised the manufacturer hasn't already designed one without the long teeth that hair gets tangled in. The short guide kept the cutting blades, which can get pretty hot, from burning or clipping her skin.I was afraid the sheer amount of dense, long, thick hair would be a problem. After we were through a shepherd would envy the massive amount of fur we removed. I'm not sure regular steel blades would have survived. The ceramic blades are as sharp as ever, so I'm very happy with my choice. I would recommend them to any dog owner now, regardless of breed. I can't imagine any type of dog having a thicker coat of long, coarse, and dense fur than a Golden Retriever. She may not look like million bucks but I know she feels better in this muggy southern climate."
"this is one of my all time favorate cologne. its sweet, it lasts all day and its very pleasent for others to smell. just dont use a lot of it at a time. and spray only on your skin. this cologne will stain your clothes especially white clothings."
We are doing some construction work in the back of our house so our 2 rescue dogs could not run around in their fenced yard like they are used to. I ordered the harness because of advertising that it kept dogs from choking and pulling when being walked. It worked great. They didn't choke and I felt secure walking them in the front yard with the street nearby. I am so thankful I took the time and effort to order a harness for both of them.
"I love the Gentle Leader! With a regular collar my yellow lab just pulled and pulled despite months of training. Walks were a chore, nobody in the family enjoyed it, particular the youngest children who so wanted to be able to ""walk the dog"". The Gentle Leader is amazing! It gives you control over their head. If you are holding the leash firm, their pulling only succeeds in turning their head back in your direction. They simply do not have the pulling strength in their head, that they have in their neck and shoulders. The only issue I've had is that people think that it's a muzzle. Not even close! The dog can eat, drink, bark, all while wearing the Leader. I describe it to people as a horse halter for a dog. It serves the same purpose and works much in the same way. As for adjusting the Gentle Leader, once I put it on my dog, I have to hold the loose skin on her neck and slide the strap up firmly behind her ears. If I don't do this, the lower strap lays across her throat and looks very uncomfortable. I highly recommend this product!"
"Sailed better than I thought it would, fast to trim and tack.Two are fun to race."
"grand daughter loves woody doll. very pleased. Woody preforms as expected, no disappointments. She wants additional dolls in series. Thank you."
"This is a good and unique toy for anyone collecting safari ltd animals.It looks just like the picture, so what you see is what you get.Before I saw this toy, I didn't know white alligators even existed, so I learned a little bit from getting this toy.When I received the alligator, it was in perfect condition, with no paints chips or black markings."
"our Veterinarian of 20 years, who has a remarkarble reputation of being excellent, recommended this product for our 12 year old American Pit Bull Terrier who has had knee surgery. Often, she attempts to jump around like a puppy which leads me to believe that this is a great product doing exactly what it is intended to do. I will continue to use it througout my ""puppy's"" life and would recommend it highly."
"I'm not a big spender, but when it comes to my curly locks, I need good stuff. I've been using this for years & absolutely love it!!! I've tried other products from high end salons to supermaket brands; nothing comes close. It's the only gel that keeps my hair bouncy and under control. The Best!!!"
"I was very optimistic that this product would work with behavior problems. The setting did not work properly, when it was on the sound and ""air"" setting all it did was sound and then after one day it made the sound constantly even when there was nothing around it. When I set it to the sound only setting it didn't do anything. If I had not thrown away all the packing information I would of returned the product. Total waste."
"WE found this on clearence and were like what the Hey...It is actually a neat system!!, really fun how it can all synch together and work!! My son has LOVED putting rodney through the ""ride"".It does get annoying if the kids get a part, mainly the big back wheel, out of synch to get it to work together again.But we have all liked it!Only gets 3 stars for durabilty due to the Rodney. they made parts of his plastic really thin and one of our arms broke off. It didnt take much to do either."
"I have normal hair, but its dry. I knew buying it that I shouldn't expect it to be a salon treatment- so I think my expectations were reasonable. It was great and it works like a charm on relatively normal hair.My coworkers noticed it as well. Big difference from before, lot of shine. I wash my hair everyday out of habit and i blow dry, flat iron. My hair is straight with a bit of wave. I recommend this to just about anyone. I think it is a great product to use instead of expensive morrocan oil."
I had this same game when I was growing up and played with it often over the years. Bought this one for my 3 and 8 year old. Frame is unfinished and rough but kids still like to play.
"I have two German Shepherds. I use these as training treats. I also use them when I brush them, which they don't enjoy so much but know they will get treats. We have tried every treat available. These are the best."
"When trying to see where the ball had disappeared to, our inquisitive 18month old proceeded to put her entire arm down the center hole of this toy! Her arm became firmly lodged and stuck right up to her shoulder. After piercing screams from the poor little thing,we were able to tear the entire toy apart after what seemed an eternity. She came out of this with only a few bruises but really this should not have happened in the first place. Not only is this toy dangerous, it really never captured our daughter's interest after the initial fun of hearing the music. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this!"
My 3 month old loves this toy. It keeps him occupied for about 15 minutes. What I love is that he gets to to learn cause and effect. You can see the excitement in his eyes. There is one design flaw. The baby can't see the cause and effect lying on his back. It works very well when I place him on his Boppy pillow.
"Hair dryer stopped working after about a year & a half of use. Worked great until one day, it stopped working altogther. Kind of expected to be able to use this for a longer period of time. Perhaps my expectations are too high?!"
"I've used various different curling irons, none of which would work on my hair. I have naturally straight hair, and it is difficult for me to curl my hair and to keep those curls in for the day. This hot tools curling iron, curls my hair perfectly, and with a little help of hairspray, the curls stay in all day. Would definitely recommend this curling iron, to those that have difficulty curling their hair."
My husband only uses this cologne. I thought I was surprising him by getting him not one but two colognes as a surprise. The surprise was on me instead! The scent is not the same and last on his skin less then 5mins. When he opened the 2nd cologne the same thing happened.I am really really upset and annoyed that this has happened as I have confirmed what he stated is true. I have wasted my time and money on this purchase. I will NEVER purchase anything from this buy again. Since this problem I have read many other comments from other customers that have stated the same. The cologne is certainly a fake!!
We have an old Form Fitter that my daughter loves but many of the shapes are missing. So I decided to purhcase a new one on Amazon. What a huge dissapointment! The classic Form Fitter had 18 different geometric shapes
"Purchased this item for my malamute. I've had cheaper(built) versions that I was very displeased with. This cover is everything advertised. It's comfortable for the dog, keeps the car seats clean and does not slip off or bunch up. I am very pleased. Did not test it's waterproof ability but appears to be substantial."
"Note that this is not a review about authentic Bumble and Bumble Thickening Shampoo, which I love.I've been using this particular shampoo for about 5 years, so I knew immediately upon opening the package that Amazon had sent me a fake. I'd been concerned about this because of some other reviews, but most of those were several years old and so I (foolishly) thought that the issue had been resolved.I was wrong.First of all, the cap didn't fit the bottle correctly (when I twist to tighten it ""pops"" off) - a problem I've never run into before with this brand - and as such the entire bottle was covered in leaked shampoo. The smell and consistency of the shampoo was wrong. Like I said, I've been using this product for years. But this shampoo was a bit stickier than what I'm used to, and the fragrance was much stronger and more perfume-y.I still happened to have my last bottle of this shampoo, purchased a few months ago from Bumble and Bumble directly. So I lined the two up next to one another to compare the packaging. There were subtle but nonetheless apparent differences, including some incorrect grammar on the fake bottle. I've uploaded a photo to illustrate this.Do yourself a favor and DO NOT but this product from Amazon.com. Order directly from Bumble and Bumble."
I got this for my sister for christmas and with in 3 days the product stoped working. I was very upset because the animal using it was a 12 week old kitten with very little poop. I was out raged and immediatly returned the product and i still have not recieve my refund.
"I have a 3 year old dachshund that will bark at a moving leaf for 30 minutes if we let him. A co-worker of mine suggested this and it works great. He only wears it when he goes outside but once I click it on, he knows not to bark. It only took him a couple days to understand how it works.I even extend the collar to go around my golden retriever when it is just her outside.I think I will purchase a re-filler of the non-scented spray. The smell kind of lingers on their face for awhile. Besides, it is really the physical act of the spray is what irritates them to stop barking."
"My husband bought this for me as a gift for Christmas. I had it on my wish list and emailed it to him. This product is absolutely great! I'm 60 years old with very dry skin. I've used all kinds of peels, face cleaners, exfoilant's, you name it. This is so gentle to my skin and it feels refreshing when you use it. When you rub the small amount on your finger and rub it into your skin, you can see the dry cells lifting off your face. Once you are done, rinse your face with lukewarm water and your skin is fresh and clean. This is the best!"
"While I've always been well pleased with products by Ole Henriksen I'd not tried this Enzyme Mask. Add one more favorite for me!Ever had one of those days where there weren't enough minutes in the hours to get everything done? Then you come home just wanting a bath and bed, but you look in the mirror and it seems you've aged. How? You're only about 10 hours older than you were this morning. For me the answer is stress, that unfriendly feeling that etches tiredness on my face.Thank goodness for this mask that refreshes, renews, and reinvigorates skin. It deeply hydrates with a healing blend of blueberry, blackberry and papaya enzyme while at the same time it brings about a feeling of rest, calmness through the aroma of lavender.I simply apply a generous amount of the mask on my face and neck then relax in the tub for 20 minutes. After removing the mask with warm water I can not only feel but see the difference. And so to bed quieter, calmer and more content.- Gail Cooke"
"I can't believe the results we got with this product. We have a Maltese whose sweet white face was ALWAYS stained very badly. Her face was constantly wet, with dark, dark brown stains. I tried EVERYTHING. We constantly washed her face, changed her food to try to eliminate anything that could be causing the problem there, kept her away from anything that could irritate her eyes. But no matter what we did she was still a mess! Then we tried Angel Eyes and voila! White face. Beautiful dry, white face. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I would never have believed it. If you're debating whether to buy this product or not - stop it! Just buy the stuff! It works!!!"
My 4 year old son loves this game! It's easy to understand and he hasn't thrown any fits while playing with it. The parts fit nicely together and stay together. A very nice introduction into the world of board games!
"I love this turban -- I never had any problems others have encountered (it always takes more water from my hair than a regular towel & it never makes my hair flat). Because it stays on while I move around getting ready (putting on makeup, getting dressed, etc.) it's great at the gym & at home. Towels fall off but this stays put. I'm buying a bunch for friends as gifts."
"This toy is great for keeping a dog entertained, but not very sturdy. Granted I have 2 huskies who can destroy anything anyways, but...I have tried the KONG brand and never had a problem. Other toys as well. This one didn't last 30 minutes in their presence though.It is a good idea for smaller dogs."
Love it. I have a 4 1/2 year old who we bought this for on his first Birthday and he used it over and over again. It is one of the only toys we kept to pass down to his baby brother (now 7mths). These are one of the hottest items at a local consignment sale I volunteer at.The only flaw was the little purple lid came off of the little cubby. We just put it aside.
"My dogs love pupperoni lean, and I love being able to spoil them with it as well. The puperoni sticks are moist and meaty. They are stored in a zip top bag, so they stay freher longer. Its a great product and my dogs are glad I found them on Amazon."
"I purchased this product for my 16 year old son who struggles with acne. He has tried many of the products out there. Antibiotics worked best, but had undesirable side-effects for a distance runner. (I don't think they should be over-used anyway.) I read previous reviews that suggested this product smells unpleasant, but he actually likes the smell and I don't think it's bad...a little earthy perhaps. I am sure it is great for some people, but it has not been the exact right thing for him. Also, I'm not sure how the price for such a small amount is justified. We'll keep trying."
"This dock was purchased to be used wiht the Pirate Ship. While the ship is definitely heavy duty - ready for play, the dock set seems flimsy by conmparison, It is not well constructed and pieces seem to disconnect, making it a frustrating toy for a child. It is an excellent Idea but not well executed in my opinion, I don't believe the manfacturer is supplying this any longer, Perhaps they are trying to redsign."
"The product is great in concept but makes more of a mess and is more trouble than it's worth. First of all, the latches on the sides that are supposed to hold the top on either didn't close all the way or completely came undone. Especially when I tilted the box per the instructions. Is a matter of fact, every time I did tilt the box to get the cat waste into the drawer, cat litter would leak out all over the place. Not only that, the dispenser drawer itself got filled with more litter than the waste which was left behind in the cat box. It wasn't supposed to work that way but it did. I returned the box and I'm back to the old fashion way which just seems easier."
I must say I have bought every flat iron out there and this is the only one that really gets my hair super straight with no frizz or fly aways! I was told that chi was the best and I was unhappy with it but this conair is cheap but yet does the job I've always wanted from a flat iron. My hair is thick and frizzy and course but after I'm done using this iron you would never know! And it holds the whole day! I wish I could stock pile this iron so I could always know my hair would look fabulous! Worth it and love it!
"My 11 month old LOVES the Around the Block Walker. The product is sturdy and doesn't ""get away from her"" when she pushes it."
I have very thick hair and I find this hair dryer very powerful! Same quaility if not better than a hair dryer that you would spend $100 on. You will not be dissapointed with this purchase.
"Since i paid so much money, i feel i can give you 1 star now and add up stars as effects are seen later.Initial opinion"
"This harness is perfect for a free-spirited, rescued Yorkie-poo. He was left on the back porch of our church and this harness just further convinces him that, in coming home with us, he has indeed won the doggie powerball! While the fit is just a bit too large, I am sure our local shoe repair shop cane adjust it to make it tailored to fit this little boy's build. I love the pattern!"
This hairdryer is great! It is light weight compare to my old hairdryer. It makes my hair look less coarse and softer. My old hair dryer made my hair looked very dry and more coarse. I just love it!
Best price I've evr paid for this! Delivered on time....would order from them again!
"I tried this for the first time and it works great. The Menthol really seems to feel, smell and work better than the original formula. Even though it clearly states the size, I was expecting the bottle to be a bit bigger. I'll definitely be buying this again, along theNeutrogena T-Gel Treatment Conditioner, 4.4 Fluid Ounce. I've noticed less itch and I was using the regular T-Gel formula previously."
"I use these for my cat, who has had persistent eye problems since I got him. The vet has prescribed several kinds of antibiotics (drops & gels) and none of them have worked--in fact, they have irritated his eyes and seemed to make the problem worse. These wipes are very gentle at clearing away the ""gunk"" and his eyes even seem to be better for a day or two after using the wipes. They are more effective than a cottonball and plain water, but not at all irritating to his eyes. I was skeptical about ordering them but went ahead due to other positive reviews. I do consider this to have been a worthwhile purchase and recommend this product."
I am ordering a second one for a new dog. we have had our first one for almost 4 years and love it. It is more like dog furniture than a cage.The plastic bottom does wear out where the feet touch it so we have had to replace that once.
"Excellent choice for the price. Bags are of good quality, not breaking and easy to open up. Perfect color of the bag, can't really see what is inside (even though everybody know what is inside, but it's not grossing people out)."
"I have been using this product a long time, about 4 years.I feel this product helps my fingers with the ends of my fingers cracking open and becoming EXTREMELY sore and painfull.I am always looking for better prices on anything I order online and I found it at a different site than this one that includes shipping with the current price of $17.00"
I bought this bed for my badly arthritic dog thinking it was portrayed by the company as athickly stuffed cuddle bed. It is NOTHING like that. As the dog gets in and out the whole bed rolls and tilts as if it is on uneven surface. No matter where I put it the dogs won't lay in something that rolls everytime they move an inch. I would NOT recommend this type of bed at all.
"We bought this toy when our son was just two months old and he loves it. We are at five months now and he still gets a huge kick out of it.There are so many ways to play! At first we'd lay him on his back an he would swat at the dangling rattles. They are bright and attention-getting. When he'd hit one, music would play and the lights would flash; it kept his attention. It didn't take much effort, and helped develop his coordination. There aren't many toys a two-month-old will play with. Then he learned that he could push the buttons to play and change songs.The toy is re-positionable, so it can be used when the baby is laying down, with the rattles hanging. Tilt it at 45 degrees and sit him in a bouncer or car seat under it. At 90 degrees when he's standing (we still have to help him stand). And with a switch in the legs' configuration, it can be positioned so that he sits and plays.There are (at least) 6 sound modes, ranging from one button playing a whole song, through pressing buttons that prompt a song to continue, to one button being a single tone (like a keyboard).We love this toy and so does our son. It is good for just about everything except tummy time. We expect to get at least a year out of the developmental value.Just another two things about it"
This is a very good product!! save you a lot of time and you dog always has fresh water
This protection tray for pet training pads keeps your puppy from playing with the edges of the pads. My puppy took to it from day one and uses it for now until I am ready to transition her to the back yard.
My baby loves how this toy lights up and plays music when she stacks and unstacks the stars. I think the lights and music helped her to understand how to use the toy. This toy is one of her favorites. It keeps her entertained longer than most of her other toys and it's not very bulky.
"I bought this pull toy as a gift for a friend. It is so cute, but much smaller than I anticipated (I should have carefully read the dimensions). Before I left the party yesterday, the paint was already scraping off, and the string is not long enough for a toddler to pull easily. My friend will be attaching an additional string. However, it is all wood and very adorable."
This product is made defective and deceptive. Will not even entertain baby as it is sub-parly made. The music is slow and it is wind up that does not last to help a parent occupy their baby or even soothe. The light show only works if you personally hold it right up to the wall exactly where baby can see it. You would need a shelfing unit just for that. This would be unsafe to install and a pain for something that doesn't work well in the first place. I will not even give this away it will be thrown away.
"I have a large cat with long, soft fur. I wanted to try clipping him at home to save money, and after trying a few different clippers, this is the one that's worked best for us. Others would bog down and make noises that scared our cat, but he seems to enjoy this. It's taken me a while to finish his cut because he has so much fur and fights having it done on his stomach. However, it's been relatively easy to get the bulk off, which is really what I was wanting."
"I know a lot of Transformers fans hate repaints, but I'm not one of them. I like a lot of the repaints, and, in my opinion, THIS ONE ROCKS! Great repaint of an already cool toy! I haven't transformed Energon Unicron yet (it's tricky; I could do it, but it's not worth the trouble when he's so much more fun in robot mode!), but his robot mode kicks butt! While I certainly enjoyed the Armada Unicron (especially since his paint job matched the Movie version), I like this one better. The cool neon green, orange, & black make him more menacing a make for a much cooler looking toy. He has MAJOR articulation (wish he could bring his hand to his mouth, though, so I could pretend he's devouring TFs like in the Movie or issue #75 of the Marvel comic book, though.). One of the best TFs ever, and, either in its Armada or Energon version, worth getting! BTW, the Energon version may be hard to find, because A LOT of Energon Unicron boxes have the Armada Unicron packed inside instead."
"I can't easily rate this game, it was purchased at some distance from the recipient, our grandson (4,500 miles) and all I can say is that it was something on his wish list, it arrived on time and presumably in good condition, we'll only get to have a demonstration in December when we go over for Christmas."
"We bought this game for a family game, and that it is. We kinda play our own rules instead of 1 one word answers we keep giving clues till the times goes off. This makes for a funner faster game. Even though it is Disney the words are everyday common words. I think it helps my kids (14, 12, 10) increase their vocabulary. Hey make it fun for you. The timer is great and with sides, no ONE is the loser. Candy Steele"
"Premier Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug, Medium/LargeI am as occupied watching as my dogs are playing with this. We have 3 dogs, Gracie(13+boxer), Annie (2.5 mix) Jo(2 boxer) I bought 2. I thought I should have gotten the smaller one but, Jo loves it. Gracie is getting into it too. Annie just waits for the treats to come out when the other 2 play with it. All 3 dogs are 55-60 lbs. It's great if your dog takes to it. Hit or miss on that one. If they do it's a great occupier of time. I have been filling it with their regular super premium dog food and a little bit of Beneful dog food kibbles & bits for variety. So no expensive treats. Jo has been gnawing on the end ball and it shows no sign of wear. Not even teeth marks. Best $$ spent on any toy, ever."
"Being a ""curly girl"" I decided to buy this lavender spray and see how it works. The smell was okay, but I didn't like the sticky part of it. After spraying this on my curls and ""scrunching"" upwards, I noticed that it got ""sticky"". After it dries, it leaves my curls somewhat hard and a bit less bouncy, my guess it's because of what's in it. I would say that if you want a lavender spray, buy some natural lavender oil and combine that with some water in a spray bottle, as for this, it's not for me."
"This is EXACTLY what I've been looking for! I tried the cornstarch/baby powder method of old, but I didn't like the smell or care for the texture and it was difficult to distribute evenly through my hair. The aerosol spray solves that problem. As for the smell, I consider myself to be very picky about scents, but once the smell dissipated after being sprayed, I never noticed it again.This has been my life-saver not just for a post-gym freshen up (which it is AMAZING for), but also as a busy on-the-go mom with long locks, it saves me a day or two in between shampoos--even in the hot, humid Midwest summers. I'm a huge fan! And you can't beat the price."
We adults had fun with it. The sort of thing to pull out twice a year when you are feeling silly.Do not know any children that have played with it.
"Haven't used a clicker before now, but this one was inexpensive yet very nice. Has a good volume click, my puppy can hear it across our small yard when she's gone potty and comes runny back for her treat. Can't speak to the effectiveness of clicker training as the instructions on teaching her to sit don't seem to work with her. I've always thought she was ADD, so perhaps that is our problem. Anyway, it comes with a little instruction booklet that tells you how to acclimate them to the clicker, and how to teach them to sit, stay, and come. I didn't feel like driving to a pet store to see their selection and prices, so I don't know how it compares, but this one is definitely worth the little amount I paid for it."
"I was extremely displeased with Phiou Offer's Pure Poison fragrance. The fragrance is disgusting -- smells nothing like it should, has a stinky after-smell, only lingers about 10 minutes, and last but not least, the spray nozzle broke after a couple uses and no longer works. THIS IS CLEARLY NOT CHRISTIAN DIOR!!! I bought some Pure Poison today from Sephora (that smells fantastic, like it should), and I compared the box, bottle, and fragrance to Phio's, and they are definitely NOT the same. The quality of the Sephora product is superior. Don't waste your time or your money at Phio Offer's storefront!"
"I got this for my 11 month old to entertain him while I'm in the kitchen. Its great! I'm even entertained with it. The songs are great. I love that it sings a different song depending on what body parts are put in place. So far, my little guy can only take pieces out, but he loves playing with it and pushing the buttons. I would recommend this for any infant/toddler about 9-10 months and up."
"Comfrey Salve...no medicine cabinet should be without it, really! Great for bruising, cuts, insect stings, and sore joints, but this is just about the worst smelling salve I've ever purchased. Thankfully, the seller allowed me to return."
"Works fine, for minor skin problems,great value for the money..16oz for just alittle more than 8oz of the same exact product from any other store I have found.Stops itching right away."
"I had played Blood Bowl and GRIND, and was hoping for something a little less complex. This game is a blast, and has some nice plastic figures. The rulebook is only 8 pages and could have used a little more detail, but not bad. I do recommend keeping a pen and paper around to keep track of what characters have moved."
"We bought the rear seat cover for our dog and thought why not try this for our human passengers. With regular trips to beaches and pools in addition to my wife's gardening business this cover is great solution for saving the appearance of the driver's seat in our new SUV. The standard seat-covers we tried and shopped for did not allow for armrests and were not water-proof. The design of this cover works great. While not a perfect custom fit, it is easy to install and remove and really durable. If your not a fanatic about appearances this cover is a great find!!"
wonderful product and a snap to set up. folds down to almost nothing. my psychotic terrier absolutely loved this thing from the very first trip. i pulled it 30mi the other day with my mountain bike. great workout and a real conversation starter.
"My dog suffers from food allergies and occasionally has a skin reaction. If she chews, it sometimes develops into bacterial infections and yeasty skin and then turns into dry skin as it clears up. I was recommended this product from my vet and paid $16 for it.I was not impressed with this shampoo. I did not notice it to do anything better than any other decent hydrating/sensitive skin shampoo from a local pet store.For this price, I do not know if I would recommend this product. It does have a pleasant almond scent."
"This is one of those rainy day toys for us. The kids don't play with it every day, but when they do, they love it. We've set it up with about four different DVD players around the house and never have any problems with it working.The kids usually use it with the TV in the bedroom. They sit all the way across the room in bed. I'm surprised it works from there because of the sheets and the angle of the DVD player from where they are, but it does; and when they occasionally have difficulty, they just try and move the sheets out of the way or pick up the InteracTv so that it points more directly to the DVD player.My kids are 5 and 7 now and the 7 year-old still plays with it, even though it`s far too simple for him. We've had it since he was about 4 years old. My daughter was about 2 when she started playing it.The DVD's feature episodes right out of the TV series. You know how Dora asks questions and the kids have to shout the answers back to the TV? Well, now the kids get to answer them! The answers are presented inside shapes on the screen. If the correct answer is in the square, for instance, the children press the Square on their InteracTv unit. They must choose the correct answer to move on. The children may choose to play games only or do the episode or they may skip forward and back. I thought at first the idea of choosing the correct answer by picking the corresponding shape might be a difficult concept for kids; but from watching my kids, the average 3 year-old should have no problem.My 7 year-old recently asked for me to buy more game packs, so I went online to get Spongebob. We own about 4 other game packs and the kids play with all of them. This is a terrific educational toy for preschoolers."
This product is an excellent tool for grooming your pet. Our Vet recommended this tool for our dog and we find that it works great for removing the excess hair due to shedding from our dog.
"I've used this product for years - no fail way to protect your pet(s), not just during the summer, but practically year round with the change in weather and ticks around practically into the winter. Good enough to use on my SharPei's considering their sensitive skin. GREAT PRODUCT!!!!"
was frustrated with the programming of the machine until I figured it out. Now it is a breeze. Works great. Cats love it.
"When I called my sister to see how her son (5 years old) liked this gift, she laughed. Apparently he burst into tears upon first seeing it because it wasn't another super hero action figure. She sat down with him and his older brother (6 years old) and they played a round and they've been playing it daily ever since. She also mentioned that her 5-year-old tends to be a bit of a sore loser and this game has helped her to help him overcome that tendency."
"I bought this product for my sister who lives in a humid climate and has extremely thick, curly hair. She is also using the shampoo and styling cream and she loves them. For the first time in her life her hair is not frizzy and she has no knots. Great product!"
"This was our first automatic litter box. We now have a litter maid, which has its own problems. I prefer the litter maid over this one.What got this one ""fired"" from our house is the pain of changing the trays, nearly always resulting in spillage of the litter. They're too big for standard kitchen-size trash bags and it seems wasteful to use a garbage-can sized bag. if they could separate the waste tray from the litter tray to make disposal easier we might switch back. Also, this unit had poor odor control and required daily use of litter deodorizer. Maybe we just weren't changing the trays often enough but... that would only make the bigger problem even worse. Also, even with the optional lid, there's a lot of clean-up to do to keep the surrounding area tidy -- as much as with any litterbox. That's probably true of all of them, so take that for what it's worth.On the plus side, this one only jammed about once a week or so vs. the litter maid jamming at least once a day. The rake in the scoopfree has a lot less to do, and a flat surface to do it on, so that's not surprising. With a fresh tray I'd have no problems leaving for a couple of days without worry.With the litter maid I just know I'm coming home to a jammed box that needs cleaning. However, I still prefer the litter maid."
"We got this for our son for Christmas. He just turned 3 so there are just a few applications that he can play with at this point but we love that it will grow with him and he'll be able to use this toy for a very long time. It also satisfies his need to ""check his e-mail"" and keeps him from trying to get to our computer :) This is the first V-tech toy we have owned and I'm thinking of getting him more because they are so well made and well thought out! Great product!!"
"I have had locks for 7 years and began to experience serious build up issues. This stuff works. I just used it and soaked my hair 3 times and each time the water was full of debris etc. and I wash my hair weekly. If this stuff works, I will be back for more-but I'm excited bc the smell is gone now!"
My dog will do anything for these non-fattening treats. I cut them up in small pieces and carry them with me all the time. She actually won a jumping contest in my town jumping for these treats. I highly recommend and love that they are cheaper in bulk.
"We got these for my son and he is learning and becoming proficient in his math facts.When it's a game, somehow they forget they're learning!!!"
These pads have a double use.sisce i have long ago run out of puppies I also hava a ferret. ferrets will only poop in a corner.I cut the pads in half and stick them in each corner of a room that the ferret stays in. I now yave a new use for them
"This is a great family or classroom game! Really young kids can play with just a basic understanding of green = go, red = stop while older kids can practice their basic math skills. I've heard of numerous variations to make the game more challenging such as switching the meaning of colors, adding point values to colors, etc. I love the simplicity of this game! It's so easy to learn and play that it makes a great game for wide age groups. The components are so simple (just dice that fit in a plastic bag that comes with the game) that it can be taken anywhere! I'd highly recommend this to parents or teachers!"
"My daughter received this as a gift when she was seven months old and it quickly became her favorite toy. She has now been playing with it every day for close to two months. She was standing well but had just started cruising a little when we got the table so she had some difficulty in navigating around it at first. The table has a variable surface and each side needed a different approach if she was going to stand and play with the toys. Even after placing the table on a playmat to keep it from skidding we had to be close by to catch her on the inevitable tumbles and each attempt ot get around a corner was a struggle. Since then, she's made lots of improvement in moving around and maintaining her balance. While most of that is just growing up, the fun factor of the table motivated her to challenge herself. Overall, this is a great toy for little ones but parents should be aware that new standers and cruisers may have a hard time holding on."
"This item was one of the last we registered for when our son was born. I read a lot of reviews and the Baby Einstein line impressed us in general.Let me tell you something, we started sticking our little Bub in this thing at three months, and now, three months later (an eternity... haha) it is STILL one of his favorite places to be.The wonderful thing about this toy is that your child can grow into it (literally... the adjustable heights are a godsend).It has been a lot of fun watching move from accidentally rolling the noisemaker part to constantly attmepting to elicit Old MacDonald to FINALLY figuring out that the star was a giant teething lollipop.The best part though, has been seeing him manipulate the catepillar and moving parts. What I am trying to say is that this toy allows your child to move through stages. Even though the neighbor girl is kinda tall for it at 18 months, she still gets a kick out of it every time she comes over, just from the outside.It's very tactile and rewarding for little ones and big ones alike.Definitely worth the money.*UPDATE* Bub is 8 months old now and STILL loves this thing. He is rough with stuff, and we have had NO ISSUES with durability or flaking or any of that. Not sure what the deal is with all those comments. He really enjoys swiveling around and around and we are still happy with this toy."
"I know what people are saying about the durability of this item, but.....I bought this for a 4 month old kitten and it holds up well and provides hours of entertainment for her and me (and the rest of the family)!Even our 17 year old benji dog tries to get into the act (I think he really believes that he's a cat himself)So, bottom line if you have a small cat or kitten you will love this....if your cat is big, I guess the line breaking will happen (Like going deep sea fishing with a standard fishing rod and reel).We are going to enjoy it while she is a kitten, by the time she gets older it will have paid for itself 4 fold."
"We have two 5.5 month old small breed puppies, and since January we've tried several different brands of puppy pads in addition to newspapers. These are the best ones we've used yet. They are very absorbant, thick, and that means far less messes, no beneath the pad wetness, and the puppies are far more accurate with these pads -- I guess they like them better too! :)"
"Santa delivered this to my 4 y/o son for Christmas. GREAT GIFT. He took to it instantly and plowed through the first 20 cards with minimal assistance. Comes with a small bag, perfect for travel to Gramma's house, restaurants, etc. My 7 y/o daughter seems to be jealous that the game is not hers. And all 4 grandparents wanted to take a turn. Would definitely recommend this game. Fun for all ages!"
"This toy is ARMED TO THE TEETH! He's got weapons galore! The trailer can separate from the cab section to become a multi-functional base! It's equipped with a disc launcher, a missile launcher, a tower gun that's detachable (you can insert it in Scourge's hand!), and a rocket launcher that fires air pressure rockets! This baby comes with a total of 18 accessories (5 discs, 10 MISSILES, 2 rockets, & 1 tower gun)Scourge's robot mode is so cool. He's about the size of Optimus Prime. Scourge comes with his Sword of Fury &'s equipped with shoulder cannons! The color scheme is perfect as are the details!If your Predacon and Decepticon forces need more firepower or troops to defeat Optimus and the Autobots!, then you MUST get Scourge!"
"This cat post is cheap, fun for cats but falls apart easily. I can't tell you how many times I've had to screw the top piece back on because it's fallen off. My cats are now scared to go on it because every time they do, it breaks."
"No perfume I've ever worn has received as many compliments, or requests to know ""what is that fragrance you're wearing?"" from other women. Even men have noticed and complimented me on my perfume--happened again just last week. I love Tocade because it is subtle and evocative, but never overpowering. Try it! You'll like the gentle floral scent with woodsy undertones, and you'll be amazed at how a little fragrance goes such a long way! (Be sure to shop around for best price; many vendors sell Tocade on Amazon.)"
This deck is okay. Some cards stink. The Joey deck is WAY better.
"Love it! It came very quickly, was well packaged, and ready to use! Smells wonderful, as does all the Jessica McClintock products! Highly recommend this product and the service by this provider!"
"I spent a lot of time and a lot of money looking for a product that works as well as this product. If you have oily skin, this provides you the right level of moisture, helps control oil production, and won't clog your pores. Part of a great combination of products put out by Murad."
"Vitamin A Wrinkle Treatment Creme - 4 oz. - Cream. *****I was trying to save some money by ordering my skin care cream from amazon. The product is made by derma e and when I started using it. I noticed that it smelled different my skin tingled, almost burning. Unfortunately I bought two and I waited one day too long to return it. That, of course, is my fault. I assume that the supplier is selling old stock or it has been sitting in a hot warehouse somewhere for too long. The product itself is excellent but watch out ordering through companies like amazon. (You would be safe to buy from derma e) I think I'll continue to buy skin care products at the store."
"Clue is the classic game by Parker Brothers. In the game you stuck are in a mansion. The owner Mr.Boddy has been murdered and its up to you to find out who did it.There are six different playable characters. No character can do something others can't the only differnce in them is there starting locations and there actual names. Your goal is to navigate the mansion finding out clues as to who committed the murder. You have to guess who did it, where the murder was done, and what was is done with. You go by trial and error throughout the house until you gather enough clues to guess it right.The game itself is pretty durable. You have six token pieces, a six sided die, cards, a standard board, and paper sheets for you clue book. Unless something gets wet you should be set.The game is educational because it makes you think. You have to keep track of your clues that you collect. You can also pick up other clues by paying attention to other peoples clues and who is proving them wrong. You can be quite savvy in the game and this part is quite educational and fun.Clue is a classic game. People have been playing it for over 50 years. It's the classic game of who did it and it's a fun mystery. No game is ever the same and that makes it even more fun. No kid or adult should ever go there life without playing this game. So go get Clue and find out who did it."
I bought this hoping it would keep me from getting stretch marks but unfortunately I ended up with a few. I didn't use this product everyday because it left my tummy feeling really greasy and I was worried it would ruin my clothes. It smells ok and who knows if I didn't use it at all I might have ended up with a lot more stretch marks.
"This is one of our favorite games! It is definately about strategy but some luck and order, but everyone can have a different stragety and you'll be surprised on what works and doesn't but can flip and totally work the next game. The first time is a bit confusing but you get the hang of it quick! Best with 4 people or so!"
"Used it with our first two kids and they seemed to really enjoy it. The on/off button disintegrated pretty quickly, but the company mailed us a new music box, which certainly impressed me. But now that I unpacked it to use with kid number three, I discovered that the motor quit working while it was boxed up. I can understand it wearing out after a while, but not sure why it broke while in the box. Also, I put several pieces of clear packing tape over the speaker to muffle the sound, because even the ""quiet"" setting is ridiculously loud. A pretty good product overall, but not sure I'll buy another for kid #3, despite all the marketing hype around the web that has almost convinced me that my child can't grow up smart without it. (Kids #1 and #2 are pretty smart. Hard to say how much is due to this mobile.)Update"
"This litter box has taken care of our problem of a huge, ugly plastic box sticking out like a sore thumb in our bedroom. Nobody knows that our plant is a hidden litter box except for the cats!"
"My son lost his compass. Obviously, it was a toy, but replicated the compass Jack Sparrow used in the movie and was something he was very fond of. I bought this to replace the lost compass; however, like the last reviewer, I found out it was BLOCKS on Christmas morning. I was very, very disappointed with this purchase. The description says nothing about it being blocks. I wanted a compass, not blocks.If you are looking for blocks, I'm sure this toy will suit you, but I give it bad reviews because it was not what I expected."
"Despite some of the negative reviews, I purchased this item anyway because there were far more positive reviews. WHAT A MISTAKE!!! We went away this past weekend where on Friday I set up the timers to open on 2 separate occasions during our absence. We returned Sunday morning to see that they never opened. My poor cat is 8 and a half years old and he went without food for 48 hours!!!! We feel so terrible and guilty. I'm returning this piece of &#$*$*#"
"I had this product from 1998 till 2004. I had 3 cats for most of the time (one being a kitten at first) I would say after 6 years it was worth the $$. I only say that I felt it wasn't deep enough, and my cats would kick litter out int othe pathway. Also the urine would clump t othe bottom of the box and catch on the rake. I reused the litter catchers to the point that I only bought 1 box of 12 boxes plus the 6 that came with the box.I did try the litter with crystals, and I felt that it worked better than just the clumping litter by itself. I didn't like the one that was crystals by themselves. but mixing Tidy cats with crystals (before they did it themselves) worked well.So I say it was a pretty good choice, except when it got hung up if I filled it too full or other reasons. I recomend getting the tent and the ramp to, to keep the scatter down to a managable area.Why don't I still have it? The rake came off of the track several times, and eventualy the motor burnt out and I was ready to try a diffrent box. (currently using the Rolling style box)"
This is a great product at first i thought it was for thick hair which i have but it's more suitable for fine to thin hair. All bumble and bumble products are awesome. Definitely recommend.
"I love this case, it is able to fit my arch enemy cards, and 15 decks easily with room for my dice bag. The storage on the top flap is a nice plus for side deck cards and counters/token cards."
"After using this shampoo, my once stinky dog smells and feels great for weeks. I can appreciate that it is all natural and biodegradable, too. I wouldn't put anything on my dog I wouldn't want on my own skin, so this is a refreshing option."
"I bought this stuff immediately after trying it at my friend's house. I had straightened my hair, was in her bathroom, and decided to try it (since she's raved about it before). Instantly, my dry hair became smooth and wonderful and I knew that I just HAD to go out and buy it. Since then, I've persuaded my sister to buy it.The directions say to use it before and after styling my hair. I use it only after my hair is dry, and sometimes later in the day if I feel I need softer hair again. I think it works best when your hair is dry. It pretty much eliminates the dry ends that I have, and makes my hair oh-so-smooth and touchable. Now, I cannot imagine straightening my curly hair without it. Wonderful! Totally worth it!Also, the product seems to last forever. I only use a very small portion (a dot the size of a dime), and I have lots of long hair. It seems a little pricey at first, but it does last."
It's a pleasant perfume but not for me. That's why I likw to buy the sample dirst before buying the real perfume.
"I do not nurse, but like the 5 in 1 idea so I got this. I found my baby laid on his back fine without wiggling off, and loved the toys overhead. He hated laying down unless he was sleeping so the little bit of elevation was great. When he started to get more active and needed tummy time, I found this invaluable! Most abbies hate being on thier bellies because it is hard to hold themselves up. This helped my son so that he didn't feel gravity pulling him down. It allowed him to have around 15 minutes of tummy time aday earlier than he would have tolerated it otherwise. Now he is learning to sit up and the boppy cradles him perfectly for that extra balance and support he needs! I highly recommend this!"
This type of brush was recommended to me by my groomer and it works fantastic! We have a mini schnauzer and when her fur gets long this brush still works great! This is a lot better than the average brush I purchased at the pet store!
This game is a good way to challenge your kids and make them think a little. Nice change from video games.
i got this last week and my first day i was beting all my frinds with it. it did not look like much whin i first put it together and yes it is my firt blade but whin i pulld the ripcord it flew in to a wall and made a hole in the wall! now i was in big truble for that one -.- but you shoold git its one its reely cool o-ya and if you wont to talk to me about anime or bayblades my neopets yousere name is san2000221 (im a girl)
"If you are looking at buying this as a self-tanner for summer, look elsewhere. I'm halfway done with my second bottle and have seen absolutely no difference in my skin color despite using it faithfully everyday. However, as a moisturizer, it's really good. I normally use Regenerist so when this went on sale I bought two bottles. It also has SPF 15 and has not irritated my sensitive skin at all."
"I followed the directions carefully and led my male dog over to the post day after day. He had absolutely no interest in it. The idea is a good one and it may work for your dog, but after 10 days, I gave it up."
"Our baby loves this mobile! We bought it when she was just over a month old and it caught her eye right away. We use it everyday, several times per day and have never replaced the batteries (over 5 weeks). It will hold her attention---cooing and happy for 15-30 minutes. I would recommend it to any new parent. I do wish it had a manual volume control for the music (hey Sassy Inc., what do you think?)."
"I had played Puerto Rico before, so no surprises here, but I still maintain that it is a great game. Lots of fun and strategy. Because of its combination of nice tactile bits, a colorful board, and depth, it is fun for those who are serious gamers like me and those who just play casually. Puerto Rico is definitely one of my favorite games of all time!Only downside is that it is not great for two players; there is a set (or several?) of two-player rules that can be found online, but the game is clearly designed for 3-5 players. That said, my wife and I have played together with just the two of us several times and still found it enjoyable, just not quite as much as with a couple more people.Fast delivery. Good price. Excellent deal overall!"
"Love this perfume. I couldn't find it anywhere in the city or online for this price. Highly recommend. Light scent, not overbearing. Regular ""Flowers"" by Kenzo is alittle heavy. Make sure its Oriental Floweres."
"I bought two of these heated pet mats to heat outdoor doghouses. I was hoping it could warm a small doghouse enough to lure a feral cat to take house in there over the winter. However, the heat, while noticeable to the touch, is not adequate to heat any sort of dog house on it's own. While the mat is always kept at a certain temperature, the mat will feel warmer after some pressure is put on the mat (such as a cat laying on it, or a phone book put on it) as it presses the top layer of the mat to the heat coils below. This is great for conserving the heat in the mat, but it does not work well to lure a wild cat to sleep on it as they must be on it for a minute or so to really feel the heat.After being on continuously in an outdoor doghouse in subzero temperatures, the heat mat stopped working. One that we had plugged in continuously indoors for our housecats also stopped working after about a week. I do not suggest keeping them plugged in on an ongoing basis. It is better to have them plugged in to an electrical timer so that they only go on for a certain part of the day. Despite both mats failing, the manufacturer will replace any defective items very promptly. The customer pays to ship the item to them and the manufacturer will pay the return shipping. The company that I ordered from, QCSupply, also has excellent customer service and emailed me a paid shipping label to get a replacement and also gave me store credit for another one.It should be noted that ""outdoor use"" and ""may be covered with any material"" as mentioned in online descriptions on most websites is the opposite of what is mentioned in the paper insert that comes with these mats ""indoor use only"" and ""may only be covered with the included fleece covering"". Over the phone, the manufacturer said the mats may be used for outdoor doghouses and can be covered with other materials, but nothing too heavy... not sure what to believe, but I'd say play it safe or your mat could stop working all of a sudden.I think this mat would be best on an electric timer for a doghouse that is in a shed or garage in a climate that does not get below 15 or 20 or use for indoor pets."
I was disappointed in this eye patch as it does not fully cover the right eye. You can still see slightly out the corner. So now I have to buy another eye patch.
"My 13-yo uses them for acne breakouts, but I like to use them a couple of times a week also to help clean my pores and reduce their size. They do burn a little until your skin gets used to them."
"My skin has never been perfectly clear, but in the last 2 to 3 years, it's only been around my time of the month, with a max of 2 bumps at one time. My mom got this from QVC as a Today's Special Value and begged me to try it & told me that it would not break my face out. WRONG! My face went completely beserk. It takes 26 days for your skin to rollover, so I was going to give it that long to clear up my face. But I couldn't. After 2 weeks, my face was so badly broken out & dry & sensitive that I stopped. My face looked horrible, with or without makeup. It made me so self-conscious that I didn't want to leave the house. Within 2 days of switching back to my normal face wash, my skin was no longer dry, it was softer, and the acne had dried up. I think for people with mature skin or skin that is not acne prone, it would be a wonderful product. But for acne prone skin, it has nothing in it to help fight the acne."
Great price on this perfume and it came pretty quickly but I can't help but notice that this one is not as strong as the one I bought in Macy's and it didn't stay on my skin as long as the store bought one either. If you don't mind applying throughout the day it is fine but there is something about it different than previous ones I purchased through the store but for the price it is definitely worth it. This is my favorite scent and I get complimented on how good I smell all the time!
"When I bought this I was looking for a standard Magic Eight Ball to replace my old one. This comes with a game boad and other stuff, which I have no interest in. However the 8 ball itself is a timer, which I don't like. You can still flip it over to get predictions just like a regular one, but the to halves rotate and have a very visible seperation. The ball also feels cheaper than my original one, so overall I wasn't very impressed with this."
"This product has a few advantages over the Muscle Milk Chocolate. More protein (20g vs 15g per scoop) & fewer calories per scoop.(110 vs. 150 per scoop)The flavor is not as good as the Muscle Milk chocolate powder. It is generally lighter in texture and I think has a hint of coco-nutty flavor. The aroma of the powder is pretty powerful to overwhelming. In my opinion, Muscle Milk Chocolate has set the bar pretty high for any/all chocolate protein powder drinks.The regular Muscle Milk has tons of extra Vitamins and Minerals that this Whey product doesn't have as a meal replacement (see the image I uploaded for the label). So although you could use this product for weight loss, you wont be getting the vitamins and minerals that regular Chocolate Muscle Milk has.It is up to you, but you might want to email the company and ask if they can send you a sample of the product before jumping into spending a lot of money for a large container. I am going to finish out this container, but i think I may go back to Muscle milk on the next purchase."
My skin has a clean feeling like no other bar has given me. I am hooked on this product and cleaning myself with this product is now part of my daily routine.
"I have suffered with acne for pretty much all of my life. I tried everything from proactiv to cleansing and nothing helped. I have been using the obagi product for about 2 weeks now and notice that my skin is very smooth, clearing up and no breakouts lately. I will buy this product for the rest of my life if I have to"
"This was a gift for the wife, who recently had shoulder surgery. I a ""nut shell"" I unpacked it (1st clue)made of cheap material and the base has little weight, assembled it, we tried to make it work even with helpful suggestions that came with it in the instructions(2nd clue) of being cheaply made, if it has to be ""rigged"" to work, it doesn't work. Lastly, the weight her hair dryer (its' a CHI big red heavy thing), the goose neck could not support. She tried it twice, the second time it fell, I was told to ""get it out of here!"" It was disassembled and put back in the box. Total time out the box about 33 minutes."
"I purchased this for my 4 month old grandson for a 1300 mile drive he was making with our family. We were in the car for about 11 hours a day. My goal was to give him enough different items to look at while on the long drive to keep his interest and keep in from getting bored and therefore cranky. I was able to attach this to the headrest of the seat he was in with little problems. But, he got bored with it very quickly - and maybe that is the goal - to help a child go to sleep.This product plays a couple of tunes over and over again and the ""scene"" changes from spring, summer, fall, and winter with a light show in the background. Basically, the scene is on a scroll.It will hook up just fine to his crib from IKEA and I am sure he will get some enjoyment out of it. The product was made well and it is actually larger than I expected."
I started wearing White Shoulders because it always reminds me of my Grandmother. The scent triggers good memories of a wonderful woman I no longer get to spend time with. It's a timeless scent and I always get compliments on this perfume.
"When they say tiny, they mean tiny. Ordered this for my 9 pound terrier and it disappeared in her mounth. I would't suggest ordering this size unless you have a tiny dog. However, I like this product just like it's larger sizes. I have some agressive chewers that love the filling but can barely dent the outer covering. It satisfies their desire to chew without the worry they will swallow pieces of material that might hurt them."
I would give this 5 stars if you didn't have to keep track of ALL of the letters of the alphabet. All ABC's are on your fridge and floor. My 21 month old daughter was given this for xmas and she loves it. She mostly loves pressing the same button over and over and over again. Each time she walks past the fridge she touches it. Love that it has 2 volume settings!
"My baby is 4 months old and has loved this toy since she was about 3 months old. She'd just stare and stare at it! Now that she can grab and grasp things, this toy is even more of a delight. My baby and I highly recommend. It can be clipped to a myriad of items from the carseat, activity mat, to the jumperoo. I had to purchase ""Marina the Mermaid"" as well as Freddy!"
"Guillotine is a 2-5 player card game designed by Paul Peterson and published by numerous gaming companies, including Hasbro. For those of you who do not know, a guillotine was a device used to execute people by decapitation.At first I looked at this game and was shocked that it's premise is about chopping off various noble's heads for points. Gory, right? And how about inappropriate? Maybe a little. But it was already purchased and brought home, so I gave it a chance as I do with all games. The game's premise is comedic, and not actually meant to offend anyone. It is for ages 12 and up due to its theme, although I think a mature enough 9-year old could play...For the rest of this review, please visit Stuffed Ashes"
This is a lovely go fish game with loads of unusual colours for children to learn. My daughter is almost three and enjoys it although some of the colours really are a bit advanced for her but I think it's definitely something she'll grow into.
My girl Chloe loves noisy interactive toys. But her primary objective is to dissect them immediately to get to the source of the sounds. Not able to destroy this toy. It's large and she knocks it around like a soccer ball. It makes her happy crazy!!! She bites it but has yet to make a puncture. I highly recommend if you have a dog who enjoys interactive toys.
I'm 49 yrs old and 8 months and people think I look like 35. I have use this product for quite some time now and had not reorder a yr or so ago. My pores started opening up and I saw my old bottle in the bathroom. Started using it and the very next day those opened pores were gone. My skin is as good as ever. Really great product.
My pug Lucy has very itchy skin. I've tried several different shampoos and this one seems to work the best and keeps her from scratching. Now if we could just do something about all that shedding...
"We received this gift for the holidays. I've seen it, but would never have bought it since there were none on display to try.This toy is AWESOME!!! The clarity of the voices and music is incredible! A quality toy! The music is so cool, for adults too! It plays the style of music of whatever toy is being played with. The trumpet plays New Orleans style, the cello plays cello music, piano keys play piano music, etc.There are 2 volume settings. The lowest setting is perfect!This toy is EXTREMELY durable and sturdy for trying to stand up.I would give this toy 10 stars for durability if I could!"
"I just ordered my fourth Staywell door. I've been using this model for more than twenty years. The original model had a flexible rubberized plastic door which you couldn't see through, but it was much more durable. The see through rigid flap is nice, but I need to buy a new one every three years because of my 85 pound pit/boxer mix and his inability to come into the house at less than full speed. But I can't blame the product and the dog is not going to change, so I just buy a new one when the warranty expires. I've always been impressed with Staywell's warranty and they've always replaced anything that broke under the initial warranty period."
"This product has given us a new peace of mind and exceeded our expectations. Our new Lab figured it out the first hour. The JRT took a good week to break him of his mad dashes, but he always stopped within a few yards outside the boundary. Granted he had to be shown with gentle nudges to get back toward the house but within a short time he stopped making his escapes every time someone opened a door. He even goes out at (our) bedtime, does his ""business"" and returns without the collar on. The JRT enjoys his new off-leash freedom to play with the Lab and take in the sun on the deck. We worry less about both getting into mischief or getting struck by a vehicle.PetSafe PIF-300-11 Wireless Pet Containment System"
"I've been using this lotion for years, and will go out of my way to find it.Very nice, fresh, sweet smelling yet not too strong. Nice moisturizer."
"I ordered this chess set for my fianc&eacute; for the Holiday, and it arrived short one pawn. I ended up exchanging it for a new one with the proper amount of pieces, but it was stressful and annoying. I do not recommend it."
"I've tried a lot of high end shampoos and masks and while I'm generally pleased with most I've tried, I SIMPLY LOVE, LOVE, LOVE how this makes ny hair feel. Salerm Wheat Germ Mask(Spain) was my favorite prior to using this mask by KAO but I swear after using this mask by KAO Asience, my hair feels supple, moisturized and VERY STRONG. I have fragile, dry, porous, relaxed (African American)hair that breaks easily but this masks makes every strand feel so STRONG ...almost like the elasticity is restored to my hair. LOVE it! Just ordered more shampoo, conditioner and TWO more Masks!"
"I did some research and found that the American Hasbro version is not as fancy (meaning ""interactive"") as the original Japanese Sega version. Even so, the iDog proves to be a fun little accessory for your iPod. Be forewarned - if you're looking for a robotic dog with full interactive capabilities (e.g. Aibo or iCybie), then keep looking. All this dog does is shake its head, blink its lights, and make some noise - it doesn't even walk around. Speaker quality is okay, at best. Like I said"
"I ordered one of these boxes just before Christmas since I hate cleaning the litter box and this seemed like it would make the job much easier for me. I had read the reviews and it seemed that the majority were good so I decided to try it out. I was amazed at how quickly it arrived. I immediately opened it and put it together. I did have a little trouble with the clips, as mentioned in other posts, but it wasn't a big deal for me. My 2 cats were wary of using it at first. I already had one covered box and one uncovered box so I didn't think having the cover on would deter them, but they steered clear of it that first day so I took the top off until I saw it had been used. I put the top back on the next day and they've been using it ever since. I love how easy it is to use. I got to the point that I hated having to scoop my other box when this one was so easy to do, so last week I ordered another one and now I can clean both boxes in less time than it used to take to clean one. I use World's Best Cat Litter and have had no problems. I had read some of the reviews that mentioned the poo sticking to the grill, so I just make sure that I don't clean the box right after they have used it. My cats don't cover theirs, but the litter seems to draw out the moisture quickly so it has hardened by the time I empty the box. So far I haven't had any trouble with anything sticking to the grill. My husband always used to complain about the smell from the litter boxes and since I've been using this one we haven't noticed a smell at all. That is probably due to the fact that I am actually cleaning it every day so it never has much in it. In the past I would put it off thinking I didn't have time right then to do it. Now, I just clean it when I get home from work and it's done in less than a minute! I highly recommend this box. The little bit of litter that may spill when you are turning it is nothing compared to the litter the cats used to kick out of the other litter boxes I had. And because it is covered I don't find little ""presents"" on the floor where the cat missed the box while doing her business. I've been looking for the ""perfect"" litter box for years, and I think this one fits the bill."
"I have been using for three weeks now and have not had a single problem with the dryer. It is nice that it is quieter than most dryers, but it is a bit heavier as well. Works quickly. Overall, for the price, a good buy."
"Easy Money is very similar to Monopoly. It's a good game for folks who like Monopoly but would like to play something a little different. You purchase properties, charge rent when other players land on your property, and follow instructions on cards when you land on designated spaces telling you to do so. Like Monopoly, it's very likely 1 or 2 players will get ""rich"" and 1 or 2 will end the game by going broke!"
The Settlers of Catan Family pack allows our 6 member family to play this fun game together with many variations. It has become a family favorite. We love it!
"This is holding up better than most stuffed animals I get for my border collie mix. It's easier to throw, and goes farther. But the tennis ball is very heavy, so watch out for furniture if you're throwing it inside."
Star Wars fans will certainly want to add this to their collections but it could have been so much better. It isn't poseable enough and how much trouble would it have been to add Vader's signature hissy breathing? I agree with the critic who said not to pay more than ten bucks for it. Six or seven at most.
"We love many of the games from Gamewright. They are enjoyable for the adults too and are very thought provoking, they make you think and concentrate. Good for everyone."
This was a birthday gift for my 1 year old Granddaughter. It is very educational and easy for her to manuever. She loves being able to attach it to the refrigerator and take it off when she wants to.
I purchased this for my kitten and she loves it. It is a bit noisy (and I just purchased it and have cleaned it twice already) but it isn't loud enough to disturb you unless you are using it in a room where you would be sleeping. It is easy to clean and operate.
"It's a nice replica toy for children. Good work with the full retractable blade, but not very shinny (the similar saber created before shines much more). a little big for kids, but fun to play with. my son loves it."
"This toy is the best toy in the world. Turnaments, battles, launchers, spirit blades this toy's got it all. I too have a team, the blade busters we've never been defeated we have beyblades from the show I recommend this toy to anyone who likes toys! .."
"Ordered on Thursday, received on Saturday, you can't ask for faster shipping. Ordered extra decals, and have given them to friends with pets."
"I love shea butter and was just looking to stock up. This comes as a huge chunk (the amount depends on how much you order) in a plastic bag (doubled in another plastic bag to avoid a mess. Just be sure to have a container of some sort available to put it in, unless you want to use it out of the plastic baggie- that might get messy though."
"I was first introduced to Iso shampoo and conditioner fifteen years ago by a friend of mine who is a hairdresser. Eventually, she moved out of state. The real downside was that the salon she worked at was the only one nearby that sold Iso, and after she left, they stopped carrying it. I spent a few years exploring the market, trying different things, thinking Iso couldn't be all *that* great. I tried everything from stupidly expensive salon products to the cheap stuff you can find at any Walmart. Well... fifteen years later, I am, once again, living in the same city as my hairdresser friend, who reintroduced me to Iso. I will be buying this shampoo, and only this shampoo, for as long as I can get my hands on it.First off, a little goes a long way. My hair is crazy-long (hangs down past my bottom), super-thick, and naturally curly. With other shampoos, I have to use a ton of it, just to make sure my whole head of hair is washed properly. Typically, with other brands, I'll use two or three handfuls of shampoo in the course of one washing. For some reason though, one palm-full of this stuff is enough to get through all my hair. Even better, although I know the instructions say, ""lather, rinse, repeat,"" my hair feels super clean after just the first application. Sometimes I skip the ""repeat"" part of the instructions (gasp!). The end result is that I end up using less shampoo, which is easier on my budget. If that were the only advantage, it'd be enough for me. Good news for me"
I have been coloring my hair for many years usually having it done in a salon. A few years ago I set out to find a product to color my hair and cover grey. Another main focus for me was to find a product not tested on animals and be organic. I came across this brand in Whole Foods and decided to give it a try. I absolutely love it and can't say enough good things about the brand. It has given me consistent results and leaves my hair soft and shiny. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality hair color that is truly animal and environmental friendly.
"This product is hard to find in stores, so it was great to find it here!"
always loved this kind of product. It smells clean and does its job well
"if you are reading this review is most properly that you have tried this fragrant before! yep, we decided to see if this was available online"
"Every time that I would put a flea control on my dog, Scoop, he tries to rub this on the carpet or the ground outside. Since I switched to K9 Advantix , he doesn't . Great product/ Decent price but wish it was less expensive."
"I sent this to my great niece who lives in Pittsburgh. From the moment her mother put it together, she has been completely entranced by all the activities that are available. It's a great gift."
"I just received the sunshine symphony for my three month old daughter and am more impressed than I thought I would be. Firstly, it is very soft and plush with a sweet face. The teething corners will prove useful when she is at that stage. The dancing lights are sure to keep my daughter's attention. But what most impresses me is the quality of the sound. It is so nice to hear Peter and the Wolf and the Nutcracker without sounding tinny. It is actually very pleasant to listen to. Even my four-year-old enjoys it. I have several toys from Fisher-Price's sparkling symphony line that I love for a number of reasons, but they all have that mechanical sound and start to grate on your nerves after a while. I can see this toy being part of our everyday life without getting annoying.I do, however, agree that the price is an issue. I am glad I purchased this, but I think Neurosmith would do better if the price was comparable with Fisher-Price."
"After hearing so many great things about this moisturizer for the past few years, I really wanted to try it. I actually tried it about two or three years ago and found it to be too heavy. But I think my problem was not the moisturizer but the face wash I was using. I had always thought my skin was oily, so I was constantly using products designed for oily/acne prone skin. I think I was drying my skin out, causing it to produce extra oil to compensate. Anyway, I'm now using the Olay Daily Facials for Normal skin, which work great. Up until about 3 months ago, I was using Olay Complete moisturizer for Normal skin, which was working fine but I wanted something with anti-aging properties, since I just turned 30.Since I've been using the Total Effects, I've noticed that my skin is softer. It also appears to be a little brighter. The tone is evened out some, as well. I sometimes get a little redness around my cheeks and nose. That has not completely gone away but it is diminished. I have some fine lines across my forhead that seem smaller now, especially if I moisturize before bedtime (I use the Total Effects Night Firming Cream) but more often than not, I go to bed without washing my face or moisturizing. Also, I use the Fragrance Free version (with SPF) and it truly is free of any perfumes. The only smell I get is from the SPF.I like the pump design but it is a little difficult to tell how much is left in the bottle. I have to hold it up against a light to judge the amount. One bottle has lasted me from the beginnng of August until now (Oct. 21) and there is a little left, which I expect to run out any day now, so about 3 months. I was getting about a year out of the Olay Complete bottle, which is 6 oz, so it would be nice if this came in a larger bottle.I'm very pleased with this moisturizer and will continue to use it, along with my other Olay products."
"I can't live without this product. I have very curly hair, and this product (applied after I wash, but before I apply mousse) makes my hair tangle free and conditioned. When I straighten my hair, albeit rarely, I use it after my hair is dry. It makes my straight hair soft and tangle free. Excellent product!"
I have a light coat shih tzu and he used to have raccoon eyes all the time! He has been using this for about 3-4 weeks and I can see improvement. I am confident it will get better. I would recommend Angels' Eyes to other dog lovers.The deliver was quick too...smooth transaction. Will buy from them again. Thank you!
"I'm a speech therapist and like this toy because it seems to appeal to a lot of children, even (maybe especially) my difficult to entertain kids. The motion, visuals, and mechanical factor make it a fun toy for kids on the autistic spectrum as well and, surprisingly, even my sensory-sensitive kids seem to like it despite the loudness.I just bought this toy two weeks ago, and it looks as if the company that makes it is trying to address some of the problems mentioned on this site. I noticed that on my ball popper the top portion of the tube, the place where a child would most likely get their arm stuck, snaps together and can be unsnapped if this situation occurs. It would still be possible for a child to get their arm stuck, however, if they took the top portion off or stuck it in the other hole where the balls go down the ramp. They need to have something that allows the whole front of the toy to snap off.They also seem to have made the motor stronger, as the balls in mine do not get stuck but boy, do they go flying. If I don't round them up and put them back in every single ball is gone after about 15 seconds. This is somewhat irritating but the kids seem to like chasing the balls around the room, and I've found that moving up the top (funnel) portion of the toy helps."
The Furminator is really great! I couldn't believe all of the fur that came out of both my cats and dogs! They also really seem to enjoy the way it feels...they actually run up and beg to be furminated when I pick up the Furminator!
"It really is great, it has everything put together in one game, you won't stop having fun. :)"
"I just purchased this from a discount beauty supply yesterday and used it this morning. I have somewhat dry, color-treated hair in a neutral red shade that was fading fast. This particular color gave me the coppery deep red I like, without the weird purple tint of some other red dyes I have tried. In addition, this is the shiniest my hair has been after coloring. The smell is pleasant. I will definitely use this again, but I will do a few things differently next time because I found the product to be extremely messy. Next time I think I will shampoo and towel dry like the instructions say, but I think I will actually put the product on my hair in the shower and sit out the 25 minutes there. This stuff is very drippy and even though I was careful, I wound up with droplets here there and everywhere. I put on a clear disposable cap that helped a little, but still - very messy and that's coming from an experienced ""bathroom chemist"" who has used a lot of hair coloring.I left the product on for 25 minutes as directed and I rinsed but did not let the water run completely clear. It's a little trick I do to ""set"" the color so it lasts longer. Once I had most of the product out and the water still had a little tint still showing, I put on my regular cheapo conditioner, rinsed it out and blew my hair dry. I was pleased that the color didn't ""grab"" on the ends of my hair and make them too dark like some other products have done. So - I got a nice even tone - very shiny, soft and a vibrant copper red tone. Why haven't I heard of this stuff before? 4 stars instead of 5 because of the mess."
I found this product while in maui. I love it! It makes your skin soft and turns your skin a deep dark brown.
"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE REAL MAUI BABE BROWNING LOTION.I WISH I WOULD OF SPENT THE EXTRA FOUR DOLLARS A BOTTLE AND RECEVIED THE ORIGINAL.THE CONSISTENCY,SMELL,FEEL OF THIS PRODUCT IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL.IVE BEEN USING THE ORIGINAL FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND I LOVE IT. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AND WILL NEVER USE IT BECAUSE IT STINKS DOES NOT STAY ON SKIN AND HAS VERY LITTLE OIL IN IT."
"My son got this gift for Christmas from his aunt. She does daycare and has a pretty good idea of what toys kids might like, so we were hoping he would have fun with the learning table. The minute we set it up he got excited and started hitting all the buttons. Until then he hadn't stood on his own or balanced on his feet too much. The table has helped him with that and also helped him with sitting up. It is a toy that more than one baby can play on at a time too. I definitely recommend the Laugh & Learn learning table."
"The Smasher RC Destroyer is a nice model of a Russian Souvemanney Missle curser. Remove some of the toy -like items, stick on names ,paint some of the bright silver battleship gray and you have a nice boat. The speed in the water is way to fast even for the real boat. RC batteries in the same size,but in lower voltage range can be purchased that will let this ship run at a nice scale speed. You do not have to use the built in battery charger, batteries can be charged out of the boat then installed. I always recommend atleast 2 fully charged batteries when operating so when one is used you can keep sailing. The Helix helocopter on the flight deck is the wrong scale. Should be removed, it could be replaced with one from the similar Challenger Aircraft Carrier which are the right scale. There is a Child Proof Safety feature,the boat will not run out out of the water like others will. You must have it it the water to run, or use clip lead wires between the the motors to test run out of the water. Instructions on the box fail to mention this feature.Not a bad model RC ship it is however not a kids toy,older children yes. Nate Goodman Salt Lake, Utah."
"Got my ""Darth Tater"" at the mall yesterday! This thing is even funnier ""in person"" than its picture! A couple of choice lines from the packaging"
These Backyard Birds playing cards are a wonderful and fun way to teach children about all the birds in our area and you can play a game while learning.
Item purchased was as advertised; prompt delivery; quality expected and great value compared to normal retail outlet
"My cocker/poodle mix (5.5 lbs) loves this toy, and it's been especially helpful in training, because the squeaker is so loud. Also, the toy comes with an extra squeaker. While Ryuk hasn't managed to wreck the first one yet, I'm sure it will come in handy!"
"I struggle with dry skin and this product does the trick. It's not too heavy for me but it might be a little too much for someone with oily skin, especially in the warmer months. If you're worried about turning orange, don't fret. I'm very fair skinned and I only used this moisturizer once a day as indicated on the bottle and got exactly the effect that was advertised, a ""touch of sun"". I can't say too much about it's anti-aging factors as I'm only just beginning to develop pesky fine lines, but they haven't gotten any worse in the last month since I've been using this product.In general I'd say this is a great moisturizer but I'm not thrilled with the price point."
First let me say its NOT a bed but a nice furry pad for your pet to play on. I have an 1 1/2 yr old shepherd and a 3mo old Australian cattle dog who both love playing and napping on it. I actually brought another one for my vacation home. So easy to clean I just put it in the washer and dryer it comes out great! No complaints here!
The hairspray arrived on time and the product is as i hoped it would be. I would definitely purchase from this vendor again.
"i can't say enough nice things about this little coat! scooby has calcification of several vertebrae an' needs to stay extra warm, especially when it rains. this is an awesome little coat; he brings it to me in his mouth an' stands there with his head up high while i fasten the velcro! that has to mean he really likes it, so 1,000 thank you's, amazon.com! 8-)"
This product arrived as promised. The vendor went the exta mile to tape the tube top so that it would not leak while in transit.
"Pilling a cat is a chore no matter what! I did not find this pill gun to be of any help what so ever. Matter of fact I found it to be worse because the cat did not like the intrusive gun going into the mouth. It was easier for me to have my husband hold the wrapped cat and then for me to open his mouth and lightly toss the pill in by hand. I had more control over where the pill went and then I could quickly and gently hold his mouth shut and rub his neck and cheek bone area to help get the pill down. It didn't always go this easily of course with the cat, sometimes it was a huge disaster and the pill came flying back but for the most part doing it by hand was the best."
My cat loves playing with these springs. Sometimes they roll away when she hits them and other times they go flying away. The only bad thing about them is they always end up lost under the furniture.
"An excellent cologne for every day use, I like the scent but I expected a little something more with all the rave reviews, plus every one and thier dog uses it, so I would actualy receomend going with Versace if you want to stand out (at least my girl-friend likes versace better). but if you want something with a light scent that alot of girls find ""nice"" then this could be the cologne for you."
This doesn't deter my dog from pulling. It doesn't even make him think twice. I don't get what all the hype is about; all these reviews must be fake.So I payed 15 bucks for something that at best will cut up my dogs underarms. Great.
"We got this for my sister along with the leapster. She loves Dora so we just HAD to get this. My sister's 6 and maybe she's growing out of Dora because she tired of this game very quickly and so did I. It was too repetitive and not quite as intersting as the Sonic game we also got. So in comparison, Dora was ""borrr-ing"" as my sister said when she switched to play another game.So even if you child loves Dora, don't buy this game unless your child is under the age of 6. I think even the game was made special for kids still learning about up and down and counting and not for kids in school. It really itsn't worth it, and not very exciting. Remember to follow the age suggestions when in doubt, that helps. My sister was past the Dora game educational speaking, even if she still loved the character Dora."
"Just wish this came in smaller size as it looked great on my dog, just would not stay on his feet two seconds. Had to return. Fortunately return was very easy and full refund was given."
"My Wife and I stayed at an Irish Cottage, and they had THIS cologne for sale. My Wife Loved the scent, but I hated the price. Buying online from Amazon and other places advertised on Amazon is much better! Best of Both worlds! Now we can enjoy the scent, and not pay way too much!"
"This is my first time using Zum Body lotion. I bought the Frankincense & Myrrh scent and it is lovely. Would kind of consider this to be a stronger scent, so if your looking for something very light this may be too much for you. It is very moisturizing, and feels like it may be a bit oily at first. After a few minutes, that feeling goes away and the skin feels very soft."
"Great product! Lasts and gets rid of the doggie smell. Not overpowering, just a small spray will do. I have tied alot of products and found this works the best on my dog. The others did'nt last very long (one day) or smell as pleasant. It really smells like people perfume.Silver - Sunflower (Elizabeth Arden) scentGold - Poison-like scentRed - CK One-like scentBlack is the original scent - brut ( a clean scent, resembles a nice men's cologne)"
"I bought this doll for my granddaughter's first birthday. I babysit for her a couple times a week right now and every time I'm sitting she takes this doll out of her toy box. She seems to really like this doll and although she is still just a bit young to perform all the manipulations to all features she tries them. I'm glad I bought it and she is happy to have it, I'd recommend it."
"It has a noxious rubber odor and she won't play with rubber toys. If your dog doesn't mind the smell, it might be fine. It's cleverly designed and colorful but mine has just been a good prop for photos until I donated it to the dog shelter."
"I like these pads, I use for my pet cat. Actually use under the litter box, to protect the floor. In case my pet misses the box, I do not have to stress about the floor. The size is what I like, it gives enough space for the occasional accidental miss. Thanks."
"I purchased this kitty condo for my ""shared"" neighbor's cat who likes to spend most of his time on my deck. It arrived in a packaging paper, not a box, with no intructions. The so-called snaps at the bottom to fit in the openings to keep it closed, do not snap in. I noticed that other people used screws but I had a hard time getting a screw in and it didn't seem to make a difference. Maybe I need to use smaller screws. Needless to say, it doesn't stay snapped together but I use it on my deck and the weight of it holds down in place. My cat does go inside and seems to like it so I guess it does what it is intended to do. I just would have liked it better if it stayed snapped into place. The rug is a nice feature and it does seem sturdy. It is a good buy at the price I bought it at but not any higher of a price."
"So this case is getting a bad rap. I am happy with it. I did not expect something that would 100% protect the Leapster. My 3 1/2 year old has done great with it. He sometimes leaves the cartidges in when he zips it, has dropped it (of course) and takes it everywhere he goes. I feel that I have gotten my $24.99 out of it, especially compared to the backpack that offers a lot of storage but no protection. If you want your Leapster completely protected, opt for bubblewrap. The toys were made for young children, and are pretty durable themselves. Throw in the case and I think you are in good shape, as long as you dont have more than 5-6 games in at once. It survives our house!"
"I work with an oxygen/propane torch everyday. I need UV and heat protection for my skin. This lotion was suggested by another lampworker. It is great as it provides protection against UV and the heat. I wish it was a higher number like 70, but 30 is pretty good. It also does NOT clog up your pores."
"In looking for fun games to play with our daughter, Cootie was one of those that we snatched up. Remembering playing it as a kid brings back nostalgic memories and so you just assume that it's going to live up to those memories. Sadly, Cootie does not. First off, the game can drag on and become ridiculously monotonous once you've attained all body parts except for those six legs. Rolling sixes can become rare and kids especially can become impatient and bored. Then you have the pesky problem of poor craftsmanship which leads to body parts being difficult to attach (the legs in particular have a hard time going in their intended slots all the way) or that have a hard time staying attached (the heads fall off with the slightest movement). My daughter had more fun playing with the individual Cooties than actually playing the game, and she would have had more fun had their heads stayed on while she played with them. Alas, she played this yesterday and she's already over it.So am I."
"In late summer we adopted a stray cat. My husband is allergic to cats, so she had to be an outside cat. She has a nice large garage to live in but with no heat. When the weather changed to bitterly cold I worried about her staying warm so I ordered the K&H Lectro-Soft Heated Ourdoor Bed. She loves it and is always so warm when I pick her up. I was concerned that it might affect our power bill, since it is always on-day and night. I have not been able to tell any difference in the bill. I now sleep better knowing that she is warm."
"I love this product! In fact I use it all over since I am so fair, and it gives me a subtle glow without looking orange like most self-tanners make me look. The smell disappears as soon as it dries (which only takes a few minutes)."
"After reading all the positive reviews, I bought the Oatmeal conditioner (and shampoo) to relieve my dog's itching. The product features ""natural"" moisturizers and ""natural"" oatmeal, and etc., but unfortunately, it's also full of harmful chemicals, none of which I'd want to put on my dog's already sensitive skin. I'll keep it for backup but definitely won't use it for my pup's regular baths."
The company who sells these is awesome! My mallet was missing and they sent one in no time at all! Great service!
Has 3 of the most popular games I enjoy on GSN.com Thanks for everything Great buy A++++++++
"I had Optimus Prime when he frist came out, but I move and I lost most of his parts. so I wanted to get him again, but could not find him till the 20th anniversary. He is bigger then the one I had and does not have the trailer, but he is still is a good toy to have."
"I just bought this toy second hand, and I was pleasantly surprised. My 1 year old loves the music and sounds, and pushing any kind of lever or button is a winner for this age group. Of course, she hardly gets a chance to play with it because her 3 year old brother just won't leave it alone! He has already spent hours figuring out where the balls go, what size balls will work and which won't, and generally just loves it. I thought it would be a bit basic but both kids are still enthralled, so I'm delighted with my purchase."
"I am a guy that is in his mid 20 and I've been balding since I was in high school and being very self contiguous about having thin hair I wanted to find a solution. I recently went in the military and have had EVERY SINGLE PERSON give me problems about having bald hair to the point I was ready to look in to surgery for this. looking online I found toppik and was really not thinking that it was going to look good. When I got the bottle and tried it for the first time I had to send pictures of before and after to family members to prove that it was as great as I said.I would say try the smaller sample bottle first, being that it is extremely cheaper then the normal sized bottles, and see for yourself.One more thing to add here is that it does not stay that well if it is wet outside but a quick fix I tried was get hair spray and add a light mist to keep most of it in place. Also I hear if you have no hair at all then this product wont work so thin hair only."
lots of fun for everyone
"I always color my hair on my own and only color it every 6 months or so just to shake things up. I let the color fade on its own and go back to my original color. Most of the dyes I've used last 4 weeks easily and many last 6 weeks. I bought this one because it was super cheap. It takes a lot longer than most other dyes (25 minutes vs 10 minutes for many dyes). I colored my hair on March 6th and here it is March 20th and the color looked great right off the bat but the color has almost completely faded. I am using a shampoo and conditioner for color-treated hair, I do NOT blow dry my hair and I am not in the sun very much. I am disappointed with how quickly this faded and I think next time I'll just buy for quality vs price."
This Gary Null skin cream smells delicious. It's thick like custard and super hydrating. A little goes a long way.
My daughter whom is 10 months old and is on the verge of walking received this as a gift. Its cute and she loves putting the balls in the hoop and getting them out again. The problem is when she gets up and pushes it she has to nearly run behind it where as she falls to her knees. It would be alot better if she could push it instead of it dragging her.
"Not fragrance free, just as stated on the actual label. So don't believe the reviews that say that it is. It doesn't advertise itself as fragrance free, and it is not."
"The velcro attachments were way too small, not strong enough to keep sill attached - in fact, I came home to find a very unhappy cat and discovered the kitty sill on the floor. Also, the plastic legs are flimsy and kept coming out of the slots in the sill. I have had a better kitty sill before. Sorry I wasted the money on this one."
"Love the new series two dragons... all except for this one. I picked up this figure so I would have the whole series, and because I thought the story was inside each dragon in 5 parts like last time. It is not.This dragon looks awful. The eel like head and bat type wings seem like two different dragon concepts combined, that don't match well. The coloration, with a bit of camoflage, looks okay on the back, but bad almost everywhere else. This figure has the worse piece to piece color matching of any dragon in series one or two.Mainly, the pose on this dragon is awful. The lack of articulation makes it impossible to improve. This website picture is a LITTLE better than the box shot, as they bent him down a little... giving him a sort of crawling look. Maybe that is what they were going for, and that might have been cool, but it didn't work. In reality this dragon looks like it's dancing, or stomping around in a childish Barney fashion. The one arm and leg positioned up just kill the look of this figure. Also, he's splashing in a textured mudpuddle that might have been cool... but manages to look way too much like dragon poo.This figure really stands out in the series... unfortunately because all the dragons are awesome looking, and this one is hideous and poorly sculpted."
"This mesh cover provided a great solution to preventing my bouncing poovanese who has great legs was able to simply jump over the top of exercise pen. I adjusted the pen to fit the dimensions of the mesh cover, attached it, and now I'm comforted knowing he will be inside the pen when I get home. It also provides great support for draping a cover over the entire top. That gives him a secure feeling and he's calmed down quite a lot since I did that. When I'm home, I simply remove the cover (I used a vinyl tablecloth), unclip the cover, fold it in two, and place it aside."
"I started playing video games in 1998, starting with none other than Duke Nukem 3D. Thirteen years later, I finally get my hands on a copy of Blood. I'm blown away to say the least.Blood puts you in the shoes of Caleb, a man who worshipped the evil god Tchernobog, all for the love of a girl. Tchernobog kills you all, and you rise from your grave, pitchfork in hand and quoting ""Army of Darkness"" already (I live...Again!), you are out to massacre the entire cult of Tchernobog, and the leader himself. The game has a pretty hokey story, but what do you expect from a 1990's First Person Shooter? You're playing them for the gameplay, not to hear some epic story the caliber of Mass Effect or Metal Gear Solid.Now, the gameplay. It is once again, typical 90's FPS action, but with a few things that seperates it from games like Duke Nukem 3D or Shadow Warrior. First things first, the blood. Obviously it'll have blood with a name like Blood, but the levels are off the charts here. On the walls, on the ceiling, floors, it is EVERYWHERE. Now I've played Mortal Kombat, Soldier of Fortune, etc, but Blood has some of the most extreme over the top blood/gore/violence I have ever seen in a video game, if not the most. Onto the weapons, they have to be some of the most imaginative, funny, awesome weapons I've ever used in a video game. Heck, the game's flamethrower is a lighter and an aerosol can. Yeah, it's that awesome. Some others that really stand out is the Double Barreled Shotgun, Tommy Gun, Dynamite, Tesla Cannon, and the Voodoo Doll. Also, Blood may be the first video game to introduce secondary fire modes on all weapons. So for example, hit the fire button the the double barreled shotgun, you shoot one shell. Hit the alternative fire button, fire both barrels. It's some really cool stuff.Right now, I am going to dedicate a portion of this review to the level design. It is the best I have ever played. Sure, Doom was cool. Duke Nukem 3D had some great ideas and cool levels. Dark Forces II"
"I am a teacher and use these wipes religiously. I orginally bought the individual wipes at Sam's Club but could not find them in any store locally. That is where Amazon helped me out. These are great to throw in your purse or pocket, when you will be eating out, too. No need to have to go wash your hands, just after you sit down in the restaraunt."
Great way to learn and play chess. I'm 47 years old and many people tried to teach me without success. My 8 year old son and I learned to play with No Stress Chess. So did Grandma. Great game!
"Great conditioner. It's not too thick but very moisturizing and smells so good! It's also my husbands favorite, keeps his scalp from getting dried out."
I had to replace a very old brush that was my favorite so I did my research and found this one. Funny thought because once I got the brush I realized it was the same brush I had and I was so happy. There is no better brush than this one for me. Thanks for having it available.
This is nice to have when you are using 5 decks of cards. The only thing is it is not level when one side is loaded with cards as often the case when you are starting out. Could be a better design.
"My cat tolerate this toothpaste and I get to clean his teeth. I use one of my old oral b round electric toothbrush heads to get in his mouth with the toothpaste. He doesn't jump up and down to get his teeth cleaned, but he sits relatively still for a cat and lets me get it done."
"I have owned most electric cat boxes, and NONE of them have compared to the simplicity and cleanliness of this box. I love it, my cats love it, and they are SOOOOO happy I no longer have the electric cat boxes around. This cat box just goes to show that simple is best and that if it aint broke don't fix it. Save your money on all those electric cat boxes (I have spent at least $1,000 on those to date) and just go with this one, it is is cheap and it works. Also, this cat box is awesome on odor control. The only regret I have is that I didn't stick with it from the beginning and tried all those electric ones, only to return to this $30 marvel."
I was using another oil moisturizer that left my hair feeling dry and hard so i tried a water based one which left my hair soft but i would have to constantly reapply because it became dry fast. Someone suggested That I try this product and at the first application my hair felt very soft. The next day to my surprise it was still soft. I love the way it makes my hair feel and even though i have a few split ends it keeps them from fizzing up. You don't need to use a lot. This is definitely a staple for me. LOVE IT.
I have a 10 pound Yorkie who admittedly destroys most toys we give him. I thought this toy would be an exception based upon other reviews. He has a ball that he rolls around that dispenses food and seems to enjoy it and it has lasted longer than most of the other toys. For this reason I thought he would love this toy. Less than 36 hours later he became so frustrated in not being able to get the treats that he tore the rope in two.
"When I got this toy I played it non-stop. I love it. My only complaint is, it's too noisy and loud. Even while the volume is low, it is still very loud. Bullz-Eye-Ball is a lot of fun though! My highest score on the 30-second blitz is 94. This toy reminds me of ski-ball and I love ski-ball, so this toy is fantastic."
"The perfume arrived even earlier than it was promised, carefully packaged. Will definitely buy again."
"I have a 3 year old that will bite his fingernails until they are sore. We bought Mavala. It was so entirely bitter, he wouldn't try to bite his nails at all! It's difficult to keep on for any period of time, so we are constantly reapplying it. It does work, but you have to stay attentive."
This is my second Durabed. I noticed that one of the screw pieces did not screw in tightly. But...I like the beds and so do my dogs. Thanks
"I never thought I would ever write a review for a lotion, but this stuff is good. I'm a middle aged guy with some drying skin. This stuff is much thicker than the cheap lotion I have tried in the past, but it lasts much longer. My shins don't itch like crazy anymore either."
"As of this writing, this toy along with its counter parts is not part of the lead recall. That being said, we love this toy. It holds my eleventh month attention. To turn it on is very simple because all you do is push the green button. The animals are a great teaching tool because he learns as he plays. Some of the animals make noises so while he is away from the train; he has the animals to play with while we are on the road. We have bought two of the other sets that connect with the train and we have not seen any problems with the train pulling all at once. We have had the toys for about four months and they have not failed to perform."
"The webkinz cards are fun to open! They offer many different online codes on each card that allow you to access special items, Kinzcash, and even the chance of obtaining another virtual pet!"
Gave as a gift and it smells wonderfully! Great price; much cheaper than department stores.
I am SO happy I purchased the furminator. We have a purebred husky and a husky spitzer mix. We got tons of undercoat hair out of the husky and she did not mind the furminator at all. The husky spitzer mix was not as thrilled by it because his hair is long and matted in some places...but he'll get over it. All in all great product that gets TONS of hair out!!
"IInnotek Automatic No-Bark Dog Collar, BC-50Bhave 2 dogs. A Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and a black Lab mix. Both are barking greatly together when die door bell rings. I tried everything from ""ringing the door bell myself"" and than saying NO, no barking, to tell my friends ""please do not ring the door bell"" because of the dogs.But this wasn't a good solution and I read the reviews about the Non-barking-collar. I bought it. I tested it on my little dog first and he stopped (after a louf quirk) immediatly barking ... I put the collar on the big dog, she barked a few times and stopped than, realized something is not good. It's vibrating, but it's not ""bad"" or the dog feels pain. They just really don't like it and they don't bark anymore. It worked on both dogs very fast. I just have to hold the collar now and show it to them and they stop barking. I use it from time to time and for the little one when we are not at home. It helps a lot. Would recommend it to anybody."
"This muzzle is the perfect muzzle for those times when you suspect your dog might nip or bite.It is a simple, quick and comfortable solution when needed."
This toy would be a lot more fun if it were more durable. Pieces come apart with even gentle play. My kids never play with it.
i think that the 3 pack street team is a very nice toy i think the person who likes transformers should get this toy i think this much toy is a very good toy because it is very much fun its cool even if you if you dont have transformers armada stuff well it worth your money. but you might want to be careful with the sk8 board the back where it clips to for perceptor in the middle may break off this transformeris the shi* yea
"This cream is very reasonably priced, however, I didn't like the creme itself. It spread on nicely but it was very oily. Didn't seem to absorb very well. Felt very greasy and I was afraid it might stain my clothes. Good to put on if your skin is very, very dry."
We bought this product for our Bichon Frise. Within a couple weeks we could see a difference in her eyes. We are on our 2nd month using it and will continue to buy it for our dog. She doesn't even to seem to notice it on her food. Some said it made their dogs sick at their stomach but we haven't had any problems with the Angel Eyes. Definitely recommend this for anyone who has an all white dog with tear stains. It works great!!!!
"I avoided buying Leader Brawl for a long time, thinking it was just a large version of the Deluxe toy with a bunch of gimmicks added. However, I ended up being really surprised. It's like the difference between a sketch and a finished artwork. I actually ended up liking him better than Leader Optimus Prime. Big Brawl has a brilliant design and a fun (if _very_ challenging) transformation; not for novices or little kids! He's got about eight automorph gimmicks and they all work well. Except sometimes his main gun barrel doesn't make explodey sounds when you tap it in tank mode like it should, so you have to go back a step and make sure everything's alligned correctly inside the turret. As far as durability, I wouldn't throw him down the stairs, but he's reasonably solid. Don't be rough with him and there should be no problems. I gave him two stars for educational value because he's modeled after a real tank.PROS"
"Scents are often hard to review - you like the scent, you hate the scent, but how do you describe it? Well, Fahrenheit was introduced in 1988 and became a real hit. Containing bergamot, honeysuckle, hawthorn, sandalwood, nutmeg, violet, cedar, patchouli and tonka bean, it has a tea-like, delicious smell that practically makes my mouth water.I love the smell of it on my man, and when I smell it on him, it makes me want to grab him and just luxuriate in that smell. So, I guess you could say that I love it. It's not musky, or what I would call earthy - it's more flowery, but in a deeper masculine manner than women's perfume - like I said, it makes me think of a fragrant tea. Anyway, give yourself a treat, and buy your man a bottle of Fahrenheit by Christian Dior - or, give your woman a treat and buy a bottle for yourself!(Review of Dior Fahrenheit)"
"I bought these to replace a old pair of high quality German safety scissors that I messed up trying to sharpen. The La Cross are very sharp but too small for my big hands, and my fingers barely fit in the holes... probably best for a mommy to trim a baby's fingernails... not for men trimming their beards or mustaches, unless they have very slender fingers."
"These were a gift for my pre-teen niece. The curlers were easy to use and her thick, straight hair maintained a wave for a few days. The carrying case makes it easy for my niece to keep the curlers together."
"my daughter had to have one for christmas. its cute and amusing, however the amusement is gone now. i think its one of those things that once you use it for a couple of hours, theres nothing new that it does so it gets boring."
"Great toy, but beware the legs do not come off. the new version in stores now has a new design according to customer service at leap frog and once you put them on (snap them into place) they can NEVER be removed. My 6 month old now cant play with this toy unless we hold him in a standing position. really annoying. we are returning. leap frog said the just have not gotten around to updating the box."
"I purchased these for my pug puppy to help with his training. He loves them. They are all natural, and good for him, full of vitamins. I highly recommend this product."
"My son has had this toy for over a year but has not used it much. I don't think anything is wrong with it, perhaps my son simply does not like it a whole lot.When he does use it, he has a lot of fun rocking and pushing the buttons for the sirens.It is a bit noisy and there is no volume control. That would be the biggest drawback to this."
"Moderately stable (too tippy for my skiddish cat, though the brave one probably wouldn't have minded if he'd had the least bit of interest in it); Don't bother with the topper and seat cushion... it's like an oven mit and slides around. The sissel seems like a great fabric without being too harsh for delicate pads... but as it turns out, my cats won't scratch anything but cardboard or carpet. Who knows? I ended up selling this on craigslist. Good luck!"
"My cockers have 3 Babble Balls, 2 small and 1 medium. I purchased this for a friend's new Brittany puppy. She loves it and it's the thing she carries with her when she goes in her crate. They are made of hard plastic and have replaceable watch batteries(small takes 3). The small is a little larger than a golf ball and medium is a little larger than a tennis ball. I would suggest care in choosing one large enough, I think the small could be a choking hazard for a large dog. Once my dogs start they don't quit until it rolls under the furniture and they can't get to it. It's sensitive and will activate with very little vibration, like walking by it at night. It is a little loud and repetitive and can be annoying to my husband. It doesn't bother me, I find myself repeating 'Oh, Lucky Dog!!' - 'Here Puppy, Puppy!!' - 'Oh no, EHHHH!' etc."
"I love this dryer. It works really well, fast and high quality. Just make sure you have a comfy chair and you're set."
"I am a white female with very coarse, fairly curly hair. My hair stylist told me that in order for my type of hair to be straightened, the iron needed to heat up to at least 400 degrees. With all of the great reviews on this flat iron I thought I'd buy it.I prepared my hair for the best possible outcome by shampooing it with a straightening shampoo and conditioner. I followed that with a straightening product by John Freida, then blew my hair straight using a brush.It took almost 25 minutes to straighten my hair and I had to go over sections of hair more than once to achieve the effect. When all was said and done the iron did a fairly good job but my hair felt like straw. It did not feel soft nor did it look shiny as in some other reviews (and my hair is not damaged - when I dry it curly it is very healthy looking/feeling).So, I give this product 3 stars solely for being able to do the job. However I won't be using this iron very much because of the way it makes my hair feel. For those who have fine to medium hair, this would probably work well for you. If I had to do over again though, I'd do more research and purchase something that was meant more specifically for my hair type."
I bought this without smelling it first. What a mistake this stuff smells just plain awful.
Easy to use and accommodates multiple sizes. Sturdy construction.
"i have slightly wavy, thick, coarse hair that i would love to get pin straight. like others on this site, i didn't want to pay almost $100 for a state-of-the-art flat iron when id only use it once in a while. at less than $25, this iron is a steal. it heats up quick and the large, broad plates flatten hair quickly. i'd probably get the chi if i had very curly hair and planned on using it every day. as it stands, this revlon iron is perfect for the few times i month that i want pin-straight hair."
"The best dandruff shampoo I have found although I have not tried the coal tar shampoos yet. I have really long hair and nizoral is very mild, I normally use Matrix products so I was impressed. It takes about two or three washes over time to really knock it out. If it did it in one wash I would give it a five although I don't think such a product exists. About coal tar shampoos, the coal tar in most if not all of these shampoos is dissolved in alcohol. Alcohol is really hard on your hair."
"We live in LA and my entire family (dog included) have horrible allergies. My dog does well when he is clean, but once he gets the dust and dander on him, he starts scratching and licking. I've tried many shampoos, but most of them leave his skin too dry to wash him more than every 2-3 weeks.I tried this shampoo based on the reviews and was pleasantly surprised after the first wash. My dog smelled great and was soft! Now, I wash him as needed, but sometimes as frequently as weekly and he does great on this shampoo. He seems so much happier after a wash and jumps in the shower when I start the water every time. Good luck!"
The card pages are sturdy and easy to get into a 3-ring binder. I thought the inserts were a wonderful value. So far all my cards fit and look great.
Purchased two of these bowls to serve my two dogs their evening snack in and they are perfect because they are fairly heavy weight and just the right size for my two 30lb dogs and Amazon was the best price for them....
"I bought this toy because my lab mix loves stuffed squeaky toys and I loved the look of the old fashioned sock monkey. It was an instant hit with her. I didn't even mind when the tail fell off the first day because she was having so much fun running around and squeaking it. She is not a big chewer and just loves to squeak her toys. Unfortunately, by the 5th day, the squeaker no longer worked so she doesnt want to play with it as much. I think for the price they could of put in a higher quality squeaker."
This is a great product. IT was a good buying experience with this seller.
"I bought these when they were on sale for $3.98, with free shipping. I stocked up for birthdays and still have several to give. Everyone I have given them to LOVES them! Great buy! Especially for $4.00!"
"because of the spf i use it as my outdoor lotion, to my surprise the area that i had applied that touched clothes i.e. leg shirt collar stained yellowish orange. after a few washings still can not get it off the clothing... not sure if it is this product or a reaction with sweat + this product + cotton fiber.....I guess this product is good if your planning on going out naked"
"My dog was prescribed this for anemia, yet Amazon sells the same brand/product for a quarter the price, no prescription required (thank you Amazon!). High iron has been linked to heart problems in humans, and so it's important to have blood work done on your pet regularly before starting this product imho, and while maintaining use of the product, as this is not a regular daily vitamin but one high in iron."
"Yeah, that first review {in the over thirteen section} did stink,""stupid psychologist!"", besides, would you really rather let the kids play with those ""destroyer of everything"" acton figures with the guns and knifes!? I mean, This has no violent content, just three cute animals made to inspire a child`s imagination, a classical childrens toy!"
"This is the perfect cat collar. It doesn't have that ""break away"" clip that comes off too easily. This one is the little rubber band style so it stays on longer. Keeps kitty safe."
I never knew something like this existed. I'm white with straight but very thick hair. It gets matted every night while I am sleeping. Not just knotted. I have a very sensitive scalp so frequent brushing causes me pain. This is a great alternative that really work! I am so happy to have found this.
"I have a problem with one of my dogs and excessive barking. It is so bad that I have receive anonymous letters from neighbors, a visit from the police and a letter from the county animal control. I purchased this collar in January and it worked very effectively for 2 weeks. The Citronella spray stopped my dog from barking more than once or twice (as opposed to 20 times) and it was great. After 2 weeks, the collar stopped working.I contacted the manufacturer who asked me to take some trouble shooting steps and, when it still did not work, they authorized the return of the product. The return was at my expense but I did receive a replacement in about 2 weeks. I will say that Innotek's customer service was very good. I received the replacement collar and for 2 weeks it worked perfectly and was effective in stopping the excessive barking.Unfortunately, once again it has stopped working and will not spray. I am not sure I want a device that I must keep returning and while I do not know if I am just unlucky and received 2 lemons, I am concerned about an endless cycle of returns.I went on Amazon to return the collar as defective but it cannot be returned as it is designated as ""hazardous materials."" I may be forced to go through the return process again with Innotek if it can't be returned (or just stuck with the loss of my money).UPDATE"
It stops the barking to the point that it makes my dog so fearful that she hides when she wearing it.
"I thought it was nice at first, but my dog was able to remove it in only 2 days. Of course, he chewed it off and now it's gone."
I was very happy with this product. I bought it for a friend and she was thrilled.
It seems like Monopoly has been around forever and surely everyone has played it at least once. This was one of my childhood favorites and buying it with different themes it a big kick for me. Familiar enough to bring back memories and different enough to make it even more fun.
"The smell is fantastic.The ad campaign is hypocritical.The lotion is very sticky, takes a lot of effort to rub in.Absolutely no change in skin ""firmness"" in almost 1 month, despite claim of ""proven to firm skin in 1 week"".Worst of all"
"i really like the granular texture of this face scrub. i've tried a lot of face scrubs w/ softer beads and they don't exfoliate as well as this product does. the beads in this product are really small and make up most of the product, whereas other face scrubs are filled w/ mostly cleanser. it leaves your skin feeling new and even after you scrub. the smell has that signature masculine jack black smell - which i personally don't care for - but the scrub works so well that i use it anyway."
"I've tried several retractable leads and this is my favorite. It costs more than I think a leash should, but is very comfortable and durable. I had my last one for several years and the only problem I had was that my new dog chewed it up - so I bought a new one. It extends smoothly, the lock works well, and it is very comfortable to hold. I've purchased cheaper leads from discount stores and had them break within a year (and they were far less comfortable to hold)."
"I have a 4 year old cat who I let use an old speak box as a scratching post for the first 4 years of his life, I was always afraid to get rid of it because it's all he's ever known. Well we made the switch to this and he immediately took to it. I have a LARGE cat. He can easily reach his front paw to the kitchen counter and a little across it. He can touch me above my belt line from the floor when he pats me. That being said, this scratching post is stable, and gives my big kitty room to stretch. We put it by the bedroom door and he uses it every time he walks by, and every morning as soon as he wakes up."
"I purchased this item as a gift for my father. He likes poker, and I thought the wireless aspect would lead to an item he can actually play with while in his chair in the living room. I don't know how much he uses it, but here is my experience with the game.The wireless controls seem to work fine. Setup is very easy, and the game runs fine. The graphics are very subpar, so don't expect anything you couldn't see on an original nintendo. The games are plentiful, but like any casino game, the winning is put in your favor, so that you continue to play. You quickly become a billionaire in this game, since the competition is very easy. It would have been nice if the game had a better difficulty setting, and offered more realistic challanges (optional). The AI seems pretty stupid, and can bet all their money on a king high or fold on a triple Ace.I guess the game is good for someone who knows nothing about computers and technology, yet you want to expose them to gaming and they like poker. That is really the only reason. I did not feel passionate about this game, as said, it is simply OK.I gave it a 4, because you can't get it having high expectations, and it meets everything you would expect from this game. If you were looking for a beautiful piece of machinery, this is not going to be it."
I received this cable through the mail today and i almost cried when i saw it. i will not even bother putting on my yellow lab he will break within 5 minutes.This is a cable best used for smaller dogs.920 POUND BREAK STRENGTH ?WHO CAME UP WITH THAT LIE?i coul;d have saved time and money and just bought one from the dollar store for 5 dollars it would work just as good.
"After we took this out of the box, we couldn't believe how sharp and rigid the tail pieces were. We cut off the points to make the ends blunt for a little piece of mind seeing that it would be in the hands of a four year old. But why should the consumer need to spend a great deal of money on a child's toy and then have to make it safer? And finally-WHERE IS ROBIN? What a brilliant idea to create a special pull out section for an impossible to find sidekick!"
"Again this is a Kandee Johnson product suggestion. I really like this face wash, however I did not find that it bubbles up that much and I wish it would. My face is really sensitive and I really love that this is a natural product. I will continue to use this product until it is gone, and if I do not breakout then I will be making it my regular face wash."
"This clicker is too loud. I'm sure it would be fine in training my pet but everyone else in my house would also be hearing this clicker. I prefer:Karen Pryor i-Click Dog Training Clicker, 3 ClickersShe's the one who began clicker training and has an amazing book called:Don't Shoot the Dog!"
"they definitely do their job and - with a healthy dose of hair spray - the curls hold! i am asian, so my hair is extremely reluctant to hold any shape beside straight. these guys do the trick. i would buy two packs. one doesn't have enough rollers. the pouch is ultra compact and travels well. great product the its price!"
"Saved me money, gas and time. Same great product I have purchased before at my favorite department store. I will purchase it again and again from Amazon."
"This stuff is fantastic! I have used everything under the sun for my cracking skin near my nails, and nothing works like this! In fact, nothing else kept the skin from cracking, period! I also like Burt's Bees hand salve, which I buy regularly, now, too. I highly recommend this. I use it at night. I put the hand salve on first. Then, I put the cuticle cream on my fingertips only. I wear gloves to protect my sheets. I reapply once or twice in the night. I don't think my skin will crack anymore, because of this. It was quite painful before, too, when it did."
"To make this work in my Jeep it had to be held with zip ties, a friend ordered the same one for her Passat and she had to tie it to her head rests. It just does not hold up. If your dog breathes on it, it will fall."
I absolutely love this mobile. When my son was young I used to put him to sleep by keep turning this on with the remote. It worked great he was sleeping in no time. I received 2 of the wind up mobiles for my baby shower but never really used them . I put them on the crib but they are mostly for decaration. This is the best mobile ever. My mom said she wished they had something like this when i was a baby!!! lol
"I did not received this item. It was returned for some reason, I don't know why."
"This was our first purchase of Automoblox. We questioned whether they would hold the interest of our grandchildren and if the quality would justify the cost. The Automoblox did all of these things and more. The both our grand daughter and grand sons played with them the day of the birthday party and the next morning they were one of the first things they got out. They are simple, well made, and educational. Parts from the same size of cars interchange with any of the others that same size. We like that if a part gets lost you can order another rather than just having a broken toy. I am sure that the collection will grow with our grandchildren! The minis were the perfect size to fit in the hand of our grandson that was turning 3."
my husband collects monopoly games and he said WOW!! when he opened the box...and how where you able to find this!!! thank you Amazon!!
"This is just about the cutest costume I have ever seen! I love it! There is one problem, however, and that is with the sizing. I have a Jack Russell Terrier so I ordered the Medium - but it was way too small. So I then ordered the Large - and it was way too big! I was upset, but figured it's not the biggest deal in the world - so, we just put the larger on him, took some pics, and was done with it. I have the photo on my desk, and I crack up whenever I look at it!"
Mille Bornes is a classic card game that involves timing and a sense of humour. A great card game for family and friends alike. A wonderful diversion from video games and fantasic game for travel stops.Help bring back family time...play this game!!!
"The item arrived safely at my house as the description. It's been over a month since I started using it, there is only one word I can express my satisfaction over my recent hair's condition"
"I have spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars trying products to tame by granddaughter's wild, bushy hair. I took her to a salon last week, and the stylist used this. Her hair became flat as a board and very, very shiny. Where has this been all of my life?"
"This was a great book!!!! It is well thought through, and you can easily imagine the events happening. The Westing Game itself is a great way to tie two things together. The events are well sequenced and exciting. Ellen Raskin wrote a wonderful book"
"I have played this game several times and enjoyed each game.To put the game in context:- Each player is a master builder working on the cathedral at Kingsbridge England in the 1100s.- Each turn represents about 10 years and their are 6 turns.- Your goal is to make the greatest contribution to the construction of the cathedral. VPs represent that contribution.Each turn has three major phases:- In the first phase, you allocate your workers to producing various resources. You may also hire craftsmen during the phase.- In the second phase, you allocate your master builder tokens to various tasks and functions. You are limited to three tokens so you must choose wisely. Also the other players are competing for the same tasks and functions.- The third phase is mechanical and represents the actual actions you planned in the first and second phase. Once you learn the game, the third phase resolves very quickly.I really like the way the game captures the feel of the book. Also, for an economic and production game, it plays very quickly once you become familiar with the turn flow. The component are of a very good quality.The only thing I don't care for the randomness in allocating master builder tokens. It makes strategic planning difficult, but that might be an accurate reflection of the medieval world..."
"Do not waste your money. Sure, my daughter who is three was so excited to get her own cam and so was I until I looked at the pics. There is no reason why they at least cant be viewable. There is basically no point in even looking at the pics since you cant even make out any of them. Yes, the quality is that bad. This thing was not cheap and I just dont get it. She wanted to see her pics later and I showed them to her and her smile turned into a frown and she just kept asking to see her pics and I kept telling her over and over there they are!!!! She thought I had lost my mind. My cam phone takes pics 100 times better than this. Look if your kids are this age just give them one of your old digitals. My daughter has never dropped mine and if she does I dont really care since its my old cam. Otherwise go out and buy them a ton of those cheap disposables or a regualar digital one for half the price. Trust me on this one!"
I absolutely love this perfume...it has been my signature sent for at least 10 years.
My Daughter is 4years old and has been playing with this game for 6 months now. We love it.
"My wife and I love Power Grid. I own over 350 board games and Power Grid is in my top 3. I highly recommend it. It scales well with 3-6 players as you pick areas of the maps to play depending on the number of players. The base game is great but there are multiple maps out now so you vary your game a lot. With auctioning power plants, buying supplies to power them and then building new homes it takes good money management to play this well. Also the order of play is last to first in parts of the games so sometimes you want may want to wait on building additional homes so you don't get stuck paying more for the energy you need. Great, great fun."
My 1 year old loves this! He got it for Christmas and it has helped him learn cause and effect. He learned to turn it on quickly and how to put balls back in. He giggles and dances with the music. Here's my question...does anyone know if extra balls are available?
"Unfortunately, this item only lasted about five minutes out of the box with my dog. I don't even have a big dog... a 20 lb Pug/Boston mix, and he's currently chewing on the 5 pieces this thing has turned into... For the few minutes we were able to play tug, it felt good on my hands, and he seemed to like the feeling on this teeth/gums, but it ripped just within the next few mins after that"
"Myself and a relative purchased the Puppy as a gift for my son this Charistmas. After both sets of batteries were replaced and the tags pulled off, the toy still didn't work. Do not waste your money on this gift."
"Great book for ""dummies"", a quick read that allows new players the confidence and skill to immediately play and win! Euchre for Dummies can even be of benefit to the experienced Euchre player."
"I don't ever write reviews, but I had to here! I have used many flat irons over the years, this one is the absolute best. A friend loaned me hers and I had to have one. A good thing after reading the many reviews here, they would have probably scared me off. I have very thin hair, but soooo much of it that it looks really thick. It is VERY wavy, without being curly at all, so I have to either flat iron it or curl it or it won't look done. Curling is a bad idea, for not only is it very drying but it doesn't hold very well in my hair, falling to waves again in less than an hour (even in the winter). Flat Ironing works much better.Okay, so I know the routine of patience, pull the flat iron slowly, use a heat protecting pretreatment, and all that, but with other irons (including a Chi), they just didn't make it look like my stylist makes it look. Which I knew meant that it had to be the iron, for I was using the same products that she was. Her flat iron runs about $600, great for her in her line of work, much too costly for my budget, there just simply has to be a better solution than that.By the way, my stylist said, ""NEVER EVER put any hot styling tool to your hair unless it is absolutely positively dry, or you will ruin your hair over time, causing it to break and split, so I always either use a blow dryer or let my hair air dry (often overnight) before using a hot iron on it.Finally an iron that gets warm enough that if done slowly like you're supposed to, only takes one swipe over the hair, to straighten it. Even my stylist has to make two or three swipes! Better yet, it holds real well in the high humid temperatures found in the St Louis Metro area and this is the warmest summer on record.All that said, I love the iron, its cord is long enough that I don't have to stand on top of the outlet, the outside doesn't get so hot that I can't touch it, it doesn't catch my hair and break it off at the plate edges. It makes my hair feel silky smooth and everyone comments on how healthy my hair looks. All of that with using a tool that heats to 410 degrees, wow! I am thrilled! Enough Said! My T3 Tourmaline Model 83922, will be my last flat iron ever!I have been using a T3 for about 6 months now with no problems to the unit or my hair. It heats up VERY quickly, so I don't need to leave it on for any length of time at all before actually using it, plugging it in just a minute or two before use. I would think with any unit that gets this hot, you might experience trouble over time with it burning itself out if left on for extended periods of time. Not to mention the damage it might do to your bathroom counter. No need here, it really does heat up quickly.Welcome to the world of wonderful comments on your hair, and enjoy your new T3 Tourmaline,Terri"
"My cat adores this toy! He gets needed exercise, chasing it along the floor and we spend hours each week interacting with it. My only problem is the feathers don't stay attached. I've re-attached them with SuperGlue, but it's probably my big cat's (15 pounds)fault as he's pretty rough on toys."
"After taking out batteries and reinstalling, the feeder now looks like it works. At first the manual advance button would not work, maybe the batteries were skewed. The feeder rotated on time and it looks like it's going to work for the weekend. Glad I bought it."
"Canidae has changed their formula and it is also now being made by the Diamond pet food company. Do your research...many, many users of this new formula have dealt with very sick dogs. There is nothing on the packaging that states ""new formula"". I noticed a change when I opened the package...different color of kibble. I checked the ingredients llisted on the back and compared to an outdated brochure from the company. I thought that the new formula would be OK. I haven't had the severity of problems that others have had, but after reading several postings at different sites, I susupect that the changes I have observed in my senior golden in the last month or so has to be the food! Time will tell..she gets homemade food tomorrow."
"I purchased this for my daughter as a Christmas gift. The packaging indicates you use 'ordinary' household sugar. The instructions INSIDE the packaging emphasize that you must use FINE sugar which is 4x (not powdered and table sugar). After searching for 2 weeks trying to find FINE sugar, I finally found some. Eager to try the unit out, I discovered that the electrical cord had pulled out of the plug that attaches to the base unit. We're lucky we didn't start a fire. I soldered the loose wire back onto the plug and made ready for another attempt. In great anticipation, the cotten candy maker did make cotten candy ... about 4-5 strands. What a disappointment. Fortunately, I decided to try this when my daughter was not present in order to avoid creating another 'Are you ready? Here goes! ... I'm sorry honey' scene. This toy is an absolute piece of junk."
"The only bad thing I can say about this pen, and it's very miniscule, is that it doesn't come with hooks to attach to a crate. I was hoping those would, at the very least, be included. I'll have to pick some up at Home Depot, no biggie. It's a great item for the price and gives my kittens ample space to run around."
"I purchased this game for my 12 year old son who is an Apprentice addict. Our general impression is that the game is fun, though we haven't owned it for very long so I don't know what the longevity will be on this opinion...The game comes with a card scanner unit and 3 decks of cards - competitor, task, and earnings. Players divide into 2 teams and choose 6 competitor cards which show a picture of the competitor and bars indicating that person's strength in given areas like sales & marketing, education, creativity, etc. Each team scans the cards in the machine and the game begins. A task card is chosen (create and operate a casino game, sell bottled water, etc.) and teams must pick 3 of the competitor cards to challenge the other team. Donald's voice tells a skill which is important to complete this task and each team picks a competitor card to scan. Donald then tells which competitor had the higher rating in that skill and tells how many earnings cards to distribute to each team. 2 more skills are then specified and teams choose which players to scan for these as well. More earnings cards are distributed according to what the skill levels were. At the end of the round, teams add up their earnings cards and the team with the lowest number results in a competitor getting fired. The game continues until there are 2 competitors left and one is chosen by Donald to be the winner.Things I didn't like about the game:1) there is no volume control and level seems quite loud2) the game takes about 1/2 hour to play and there is no way to save it in the middle of a game - the unit will shut off automatically after 5 minutes of non-use3) batteries not included4) each time you start the game, Donald's voice proclaims that this is the best game ever made (not quite...)Things I do like about the game:1) the game makes you think about what skills will be important to do well in a given task - you pick which of your competitors will compete in the task based on your conclusions2) swiping the cards in the machine is fun"
"Good - What it isThis is a quick protein boost for your hair that you can use fairly often. If you're experiencing mild breakage, this is a way to get your hair into shape quickly. If you are experiencing moderate breakage, using this on a schedule is a great way to gradually improve the quality of your hair without accidentally overdoing it. Furthermore, plenty of people use this without following up with a DC and retain softness. I personally have never done protein without a moisture DC immediately after, so I can't comment on that.Bad - What it isn'tIf you want a quick MEDIUM/LARGE protein boost, you're better off using ORS Mayo or perhaps that 2 Step. I've seen what the 2 step can do to people, so I won't be trying it. At any rate, I would recommend this to anyone who sometimes needs more protein in their hair diet, which is quite a lot of people."
"My son was only 6 months old when he received this the &quot;ball blast,&quot; it was a Christmas gift for him from friends of ours. My husband put it together and we left it out in the living. Our son when right over to it and quickly learned he could pull himself up by using the toy for support, he was walking by 9 months. My husband and I believe it was because of this toy.Our son loves playing with the balls on their own AND together with the &quot;blaster&quot;, he even tries to put other toys (blocks) down the shoots. My son is now 13 months old and he STILL plays with the Ball Blast everyday, he LOVES it! In our opinion, EVERY child should have one of these. This toy has now become our new gift of choice for our friends and family."
"Its a gate for pets, so its a simple and well made product that shouldn't cost a lot of money. Buy this because all pet store gates are way over priced for something that is less durable then this."
"man!!!! I wish I had read these reviews! this looked so cool at the store... I really like to buy toys that change as the baby grows. I thought that maybe, the foot platform would be something that would trigger something if the baby kicked it... but no. I think when she can sit up to play with it, she might like it, but for the price... don't buy it!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This game was great to play, adults and kids can get into the fun! Very informative and lots of FUN!"
"I received the first jug as a gift for my golden retriever (80 lb.), then bought a second one when I picked up a Wheaten terrier (30 lb). Both dogs enjoy working their breakfast kibble out of the jug. The Wheaten will eat until full and the retriever, true to his nature, can't stop eating and playing. They are able to almost completely empty the jugs. Their size difference changes their strategies a bit but doesn't affect their ability to play.When first introducing the toy to the dogs, I ""primed"" the jug by spilling out a couple high-value treats mixed with kibble (later moving to only kibble). The rope knot inside the jug can also block the entrance, so I was careful to make sure that the knot was well inside the jug. And I made sure to fill the jug about 3/4 full because the jug can clog if it's totally full and I didn't want them to be discouraged if it was too unrewarding. Now the dogs are more experienced, so I don't prime the jugs anymore. I am increasing the challenge by sitting the jugs upright and will soon be moving to asking them to find the jug.The container is easy to fill but the cloth rope makes cleaning a little more difficult. My Wheaten uses the rope to retrieve the jug from under the coffee table but I'm still considering removing the rope because of hygiene and because it blocks the jug opening.I recommend this if you have dogs cooped up indoors, if you have dogs that need to keep themselves occupied, and especially for large-chested breeds who gulp down their food (because the jug forces the dog to literally only eat a couple kibble at a time)."
I love this skin musk. It is a very clean and fresh smell. I always get compliments from strangers when I wear it.
The first one I bought used it and loved it. The second time I went to use it I started to smell something burning. OK so I pulled the plug and waited and then tried it again. Wouldn't even get hot. Emailed Conair and wasted time with them so I just returned it to the store. I went and got another one this week and it worked the first time and the second time I couldn't get it even to warm up. So back it goes. What are the odds of it happening twice unless they can from the same batch? Does that make sense. Lets try for the third time and see what happens.
"This crate solved my problem of dog hair in my car. Keeping hair confined for weekly cleaning, much easier. My 30 pound crate trained dog loves to go along for the ride in the sof-krate. She can still see the views and us, but mostly chooses to snuggle up and sleep. She will spend several hours at a time very happy in the car now!"
"After tiring of taking plastic grocery bags filled with kitty peeps and poops out to the garbage every day, I finally decided to give the litter locker a try. Before it arrived, I was already regretting my itchy buy finger and the purchase thinking that it was really a glorified plastic shopping bag. I mean, after all, I double and triple up on the plastic bags, twist and knot them after a scooping. Really, how much better would this glorified grocery bag be? Boy was I wrong! I cannot believe how the smell in my little closet where I keep the litter box has decreased - and I didn't think it was that bad in the first place!Also, after owning (or being owned) by three cats for several years, cleaning up cat pee, poop, puke, hairballs and even dead rodent gifts didn't even gross me out anymore. I was very, very surprised to find how pleasant it is to not actually have to touch the poops and peeps anymore - another benefit of the litter locker that I wasn't even looking for when I bought it.Finally the litter locker has helped reduce litter scatter in my house. The litter box is in the corner. In essence, enclosed on two sides. But, my cats would jump over the side of the box on the open side scattering litter all over refusing to politely exit at the front of the box where I'd set a litter mat. I now keep the litter locker along the open side the cats would previously jump over forcing them to exit onto the litter mat.Only drawback is now that I'm sold on the litter locker, I need to shell out more money to buy 2 more of the gadgets for the other litter boxes in my house."
My wife loves it and I love it what more is there to say. It is much cheaper than to shop at your local store.
I have purchased Intrakera from a salon for years. This was my first purchase from this vendor on Amazon. The Intrakera I was sent appears lighter in color and diluted. It is not as thick as usual. I won't purchase again.
"I've used this product in a number of different ways... Hot for my sinuses, hot or cold for sore muscles (basically a heating pad or ice pack). I'm even planning to use it cold during labor when I give birth. Great multi-purpose product that's very easy to use.If you're using it warm, it heats quickly (30 sec - 1 min in the microwave) and remains warm for about 10 minutes.My only complaint is that it has to be frozen for a long time (several hours) to use it cold."
Very fun...my boyfriend is a serious Simpsons collector and just loved this.
"Once again, Amazon gets the job done for me. This is a great product, and my dogs don't mind me tending to their dental care with it. Easy to use, seems to be working very well, along with daily brushing with doggie tooth past in between treatments. Thanks again for great pricing."
"My mom purchased this toy for my then 6 month old son and he absolutely fell in love with this toy. It was the first toy he actually figured out how to play with (pushing the lever down). Now at 9 months, it's the first toy he heads to still. He hasn't quite figured out how to put the balls back in yet, but he's recently learned how to throw and loves to throw the balls across the room and scoot or roll over to them (not quite crawling yet, but going after the balls is helping him learn); he'll also play ""catch"" with them. The gumball machine and the roll-a-rounds keep him busy for hours thus making it MY favorite toy as well! :) I'm going to definitely be buying more of the Roll-a-Rounds and the Peek-a-blocks items from Fisher Price! A++!!"
"I got this perfume when I was 18 (I think..) Everywhere I go, I get compliments and people asking (I hope I don't use too much). I like it for its freshness and the citrus touches it has. It is definitely not super sweet nor strong. You might think I am slipping but it puts me in a good mood. A very summer scent and very good for all ages."
"My two cats love this scratching post. They're adolescent cats with a lot of energy, and my female cat loves to climb. My male cat is large and scratches vigorously, so he wouldn't use the sisal scratching pad I bought that hangs on a door handle (the wobbling made him nervous). Neither cat is interested in cardboard scratchers, but they liked to scratch the sides of the sofa, the corners of my mattress, and my throw rugs.So, the reasons this post is great for them"
Great seller. This company has excellent response time. Answers any questions very quickly. .Product was not the color as shown but seller made the transaction right.
Great fragrance!!! Not overpowering - not fruity - not sweet. The fragrance is subtle and clean.
"This is by FAR one of my favorite scents. I constantly get comments and even inquiries like ""what are you wearing? THAT cologne smells AWESOME!"" It's also a good bang for the buck! I wear it almost everyday and I am on my second bottle in over a year. I would highly recommend."
Driger S he is a very good beyblade frist his blade base it has a metal change base if you lanch it on the slope of the dish he will go into attack mode and go fast and is kind of not good in that mode but if you canget it into the dish not tiltid it will go into itsbest mode but it is also good for combos and the attack ring is good for zombes and upper attack but over all it is a real good buy if you come across it you should buy it I MEAN IT THIS BLADE ROCKS.
"My daughter got this when she was 3 and at 4 years old she still rides it all over the place, it spins in circles, sideways, back and forth... its so awesome. Every kid that comes over hops on it and goes for a ride. It's truly one of the best toys I've ever bought her, we're getting the smaller one for our 1 year old as well. I can't wait! I recommend this to everyone I know, totally worth the $$!"
If love you love the first one then this one will delight you as well with a bolder sharper smell that will make heads turn buy this one you can not go wrong for the price and the smell.
This is awesome. Keeps my two little ones (3 yrs and 4yrs) busy while I cook. They are so proud after they spell a word. A couple of letters sound alike but when they put the wrong one in they search for the other letter that it sounds like which I believe makes it an even better teaching tool. They love it!
"I've been using Nutranail for years. It's one product I can honestly say is true to it's word.Whenever I want my nails to grow, I faithfully use Nutranail. I'll apply it nightly for 5-7 days and within that time, I notice a difference in the length of my nails. So the product does work. Nutranail is a great product!! Wish they made it for hair...lol"
"this fragrance is my absolute favorite. its feminine but not overpowering, lovely and soft but refreshing as opposed to powdery. please try it on yourself first though its the only way to really tell if it works for you."
"Excellent ,Our dogs love them.We have small dogs,so the size is perfect.Little hearts for little dogs"
"My Female Rottweiler has been playing with this toy since she was a puppy. This toy lasts for years and she has only been able to rip one apart. No matter how hard she has tried, she has rarely been able to tear one up, whether we throw it like a frisbee, play tug of war or just lying on the floor chewing on it. One draw back for some of you may be the squeaking noise that it makes. My dog loves to make the toy squeak, and it is loud, so if you are thin on patience when it comes to noisy toys, I would tell you to use it at the park or in the back yard. This is by far the best toy that we have ever purchased for our Rottweiler!"
"Yes this toy does look cool, but I have to give it a low rating because it is basically an older Spawn toy, but they added a red cape. Take a look at Spawn VI (6) from last year, its the same thing."
The French Vanilla French Milled Soap has a lovely fragrance. It was packaged well and received quickly. I bought four bars to give as gifts and everyone loved the fragrance! I'm sure I will purchase more in the future!
"My kids had this game when they were little and loved it. So I bought one for the Grandkids for Christmas. Its a great game for pre-schoolers+. It teaches little ones to take turns, no reading, no counting and no parts to loose. You can stash it in your purse to occupy the kids on the go. Its durable, portable and just good giggly fun. I have plenty of other games in the closet that quickly loose the kids interest or end up with missing parts. Well worth the money. Quick delivery from seller. Ordered it right before Christmas and actually arrived in time to be wrapped and under the tree."
"I have a 7 month old schnoodle. He's only 10 lbs but while he's been teething he's been capable of destroying everything! He was initially very careful with this dragon. He would creep up to it and lick its tongue.. then run away when we squeezed it and the tongue flipped out.. after some introduction, he was all over this thing. Absolutely loved it. 1 day later we looked at the poor dragon and his tongue was missing! and one of his toes were gone too... :( I thought it would be more durable then it was.. I'm sure our puppy ended up eating these missing rubber parts despite our careful supervision. Also, we were concerned about the make/ coloring of the dragon. This was made in China? is there a possibility of lead in the coloring? (flashback; all the toy recalls in china).. Our puppy never got sick or anything, just our paranoid thoughts. anyway, though our puppy loved it, this is why I gave it only 3 stars."
"I had read some of the reviews that this was a cheaply made checker set, but I figured for the price, I'd give it a try. Well, it is very cheap. The board is super flimsy and the pieces don't nicely stack. You can play checkers on it so it does it's job, but we'll soon be buying a nicer set."
"The anti-Neutrogena post cracks me up- aging is a process, and even stuff the really does age you like sun damage takes years. Nothing sold OTC, and certainly nothing Neutrogena makes, will make you look like the Cryptkeeper after 3 weeks. Anyway, I use this and the Visibly Firm serum, and even my dermatologist commented on how good my skin looks."
"My friends and I consider ourselves diehard Scarface fans, so it was a sure thing that I would be ordering these figures as holiday gifts.Mezo made two figures for the talking line of toys, and each toy has nine different sayings. ""The Player"" is Tony Montana in a white suit, and most of his lines are laid back ones. ""The Fall"" is this version (black suit Tony), which says mostly quotes that Pacino shouted during the movie.The detail of the figure is excellent, down to the ""assassin"" heart tattoo on Tony's hand, and a loose-fitting gold chain around his neck (actually moves).Here's where the white suit Tony Montana figure really differs from the black suit one"
"One of my sons collects Monopoly editions and this was his Christmas present. We have played this Mega edition several times since then and it is fast becoming our favorite. It moves much quicker and the property gets sold rapidly--even though there is more property on this enlarged board. Because of that you need to wheel and deal more in order to actually get a monopoly. The addition of train depots and skyscrapers (along with some other tweeks) make the stakes much higher. Since a girlhood, I have always felt that Monoply is a great way to encourage mental math skills. Therefore, I justify it as an educational game, too."
seems to be less cats but they are still coming around. Doesn't seem to cover the area they state - but does help
"A good friend of mine recommended this box and the reviews seemed so wonderful that I was actually oddly excited to recieve this product. Unfortunately, when I set it up the front latch did not close properly at all and litter spilled out the sides, all over my floor. I'm just glad I was able to return this. I am sure if it was better constructed it would be great since the idea of the roll scoop system seems great, but the poor construction makes it a terrible product."
"this product is amazing! It enhances curls, keeps the locks together, eliminates frizz and gives you that sexy out of bed look...I get compliments all the time with this product!! I highly recommend it!"
hay the liger zero is cool and so is the sound it makesbut it moves kind of stiff mine isn;t thow because mine ismade in japan so it goes faster and moves better but other wise it is very cool to have and there nete to put together soget this whon for the colectoin se ya
"Does everything it claims to do, but make sure to take a shower before using or soften your nails first. If your nails are too hard the plastic parts will break. Just happened to me tonight. It is a fantastic item for people with wrist or joint problems. But if you don't have those problems, you are better off with a sturdier regular nail clipper."
"This is great for your hair. I don't color my hair any longer, but I've been putting peroxide on it to add a few strains of red in with my white! This tones it down so all the colors . . . white, gray, red, etc. . . all blend in together for a pleasing effect."
"the doll is really cute, and very well made. I was on the search for a toy that could be a ""lovey"" for my baby son to help self sooth him when he sleeps. The doll is very soft and small enough for him to hang on to with his little arms (4 months old)"
Best choice !! 10 out of 10. U'll never regret...It can be used for straightening.....Love this product. Will surely recommend this product.....
"I am a big fan of this durable, cute toy! too bad my five month old doesn't really care for it. I have been trying to get him to play with it but he prefers almost everything else! too bad.. maybe when he is a little older.."
"I love the sent of this perfume, I wear it more than my other fragrances. I love that I can buy it in a small bottle, because I don't wear perfume alot, and the small bottle lasts a long time without me having to spend a fortune on perfume! :D"
I love this conditioner! I've tried other brands but for my long thick hair it's the best! I just can't use anything else and get the same result. I highly recommend it.
"It's a great workout for the brain, great for people who like fast-paced competition -- even if they're only playing solitaire -- and portable enough to travel with (and addictive enough to want to travel with it)."
"My dog LOVES these and they really do keep his breathe fresh. I know this for a fact because I stopped buying them for a little while and his breath was really bad. but then I bought them again and they work wonders. I don't understand why there are so expensive here because at Walmart I buy them for $1.62 for a 3.1 oz pack. Sometimes they have special big packets foe sale, mostly around holidays. Again go to WALMART! SOOOO much cheaper."
"My beautiful Great Dane Kramer, is allergic to GRASS!!! We've been thru so many products, antibiotics, yeast treatments and steroids but finally his skin is under control with baths using VETS medicated shampoo about every five days. Kramer is a happy boy again!!!"
My dog (a lab mix) destroyed this in 5 minutes. He did seem to enjoy every minute of ripping out the stuffing though. In general it was a waste of money.
"This game is the best logic IQ indicator I've ever encountered and, considering it is a hobby of mine, I have encountered a good deal. It is art in simplicity. Not so ''durable'' because of the very very small parts. Almost everyone I know loves this game."
We bought this for our daughter when she was 5 months old and she absolutely loves to ride in her pink car. She doesn't even have to be outside. She loves when her father pushes her just around the house. The only problem with this car are the noise made by the wheels against the pavement. It can get quite loud. Other than that this is a great toy and would highly recommend.
Excellent Product. Super Excellent service the item arrived so fast I literally thought they shipped it from next door. A+++++++++
"My wife and I purchased one of these from Amazon about 2 years ago, and it was great..I mean really great, solved all of our cat feeding issues. That one eventually died and I attributed it to two years of cat food oil going thru it. So we decided to get another from Amazon. We got it and it broke in two days..the display went out and the battery light kept coming on. So we returned it and the replacemet one didnt work at all. So we are returning that one. Not sure why this is, but maybe we initially got the fluke one that actually worked."
"My daughter is so sensitive to hair brushing that I've been using those ultra soft doll brushes on her, but they don't really get through the hair. This brush is still gentle, but firm enough to do the job, and much easier to hold. The comb with the rubber tips is wonderful, as well!"
I have long thick wavy hair and this just makes it worse! No matter if it rainy out or not your hair is going to be fizzy. It took forever to heat up and you had to replace the water seemed like every 10 mins. Go for something more money and not a steam straightener!!
"It's really a great toy. It has an adjustment for the difficulty and it's easy enough to clean. My pup personally LOVES it. If you've got a dog who gets bored when you're away, or a dog who needs constant engagement, this is a great toy to introduce. Just stuff it with their favorite treat and let them have at it."
It is a good straighener. Took me me a bit to get use to the narrow iron. Seems to have to take more than one pass through hair to get it to straighten where I like. I had a Conair with a wider iron and that took only one pass through.
This is an excellent product which I discovered in the US. I have brought many to keep me going.
"I lost my other dog repeller which BTW cost twice the price. After seeing this one and reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. Oila! It works just a good. It does not have a belt clip like my other model however it fits nicely into my pocket along with my cell phone and keys. It works best on ""spirited"" dogs not so great on those that just want a sniff of you. That's okay with me. I'm more concerned about the spirited ones that want to bite or are more aggressive with their playing. Good product for the price."
Disappointed that my order was cancelled with no reason given. Won't order from them again
"I got this game for my 10 year old son because of the educational value that it has. But, I watched my son play Sentence Says with 3 of his friends and have a blast. I think they played it 3 times in a row! I noticed that the sentences the kids came up with got more creative as they got further into game play. It definitely stimulates the mind and helps with the grammar skills as well as being FUN!"
"A few years ago, my grandmother passed away. My granpa was left alone, so one of the ways my family sought to help him was getting together once a week to play cards and bet a little money for the winner. It really helped but since my grandfather is 86 now, he has trouble hearing and seeing. Still, he continued to play.The last few months it started getting frustrating for him and he was becoming less motivated to play. So I thought I'd look for some cards to help him out and found these. His reaction when they showed him the cards was priceless; he couldn't believe he could clearly read them, with no problems at all! He's back to having fun and even won the first game they played with them! A great product that's helped out in many ways, give it a go and play with your loved ones."
"I have read the previous reviews and agree with almost ALL of them basically, the good and the bad. I've had mine for about 9 months. I've experienced the poopy water that would not drain and the unbelievably annoying beeps. I've experienced the olfactory experience of blown-dry poop with hint of perfume on many occasions. (I automatically start my bathroom fan running when I start the CatGenie) That is quite unlike any other bodily experience I have even had. The poopy water experience at, say, 2 am, is quite life-changing too while your cats are pacing feverishly to use the unusable litter box. I have three cats and all of them adjusted to it perfectly. None of them is freaked out by the horrific noise it makes while churning and disposing of cat poop. In fact, they often like to watch it in action. One in particular loves lying on top of the domed-cover (tuxedo package) while it blow dries because it's so warm. During my first non-draining water experience I called Petnovation's toll free number in desperation. The young tech support fellow was as patient and kind as I was not. He walked me through one test after another until the problem was identified. In truth I had precipitated the problem by overfilling the bowl with the granules and the water sensor got dirty as a result. Mea culpa.Since then things have been pretty good - the occasional need to clean the water sensor or remove a cat hair plug from the drain. I've learned to live with all of that for the sheer convenience of not having to lug 40 pound pails of cat litter in (and many more pounds of it used OUT)But what impressed me most is the company! First their tech support was wonderful! And most recently they engineered an improved hopper system to reduce (eliminate) cat hair plugs and water sensor problems. But what is so amazing to me is that, no questions asked, they will send it to you for 1 cent plus $5 shipping (no shipping charge at all if you're ordering other supplies). It practically reinvents the process but at virtually no cost they send you the upgrade! Just log on to their website. Now THAT is loyalty to your customers! Cheers Petnovations!PS"
"Many years ago, I was browsing through Sacks Fifth Ave., looking for a fresh, spring/summer scent that would suit me. The saleswoman was extremely helpful, and spent some time discussing various perfumes with me, as well as spritzing different paper strips with sample scent, rather than my arm. I preferred light, transparent woodsy scents - subtle. Chanel had just launched a new perfume, in 1974, which combined the fresh, fruity tang of lemon from Italy, light spring floral notes of Honeysuckle and Water Hyacinth, and pulled it all together with the woodsy charm of Vetiver and oakmoss.Vetiver has a delightful smoky woodsy fragrance which is frequently blended with geranium and jasmine. It is a tall, dense, wild grass with long narrow leaves and a strand of underground white, yellow and brown roots and is sought after for its calming, protective, soothing and uplifting characteristics. Vetiver can be found in Java, Haiti, Japan, Indonesia and South India.I find it goes deliciously well with the above ingredients and leaves one feeling clean, fresh, intimate and very sexy. There is no astringent smell or feel to Cristalle, unlike many ""fresh scents,"" nor is it too heady or heavy. Cristalle is a stimulating fragrance and an excellent perfume for day wear, especially in warm weather and for sports. I also wear it on warm evenings as I prefer the crisp, woodsy scent to the sweeter flowery ones in the heat. Because it is so subtle, it is ideal for the workplace also, used sparingly.Chanel relaunched Cristalle in 1993 with a richer floral blend in the eau de parfum concentration with a slightly fruiter chypre base. The changes did not impact my opinion at all. It is still an outstanding fragrance, one of my very few favorites.I have worn ""Cristalle"" for thirty years now, and it has carried me through various life phases beautifully and smoothly. An absolute feel good perfume! ENJOY!PS - I just noted that one of the other reviewers mentions that Chris Noth (""Law & Order,"" ""Sex in the City""), is Wowed by Cristalle! Makes sense, I am Wowed by Chris Noth!!JANA"
I installed this door into the side of my storage building which has wall about 0.5 inches think. It worked well with that. The door had a detent around the frame insert edge for bending and breaking off a section of the insert so that it could be fitted in a thin wall like I did. It did take quite a bit of force with pliers to bend and break off that portion of the frame.I would buy again knowing what I know now.
"Growing up, my family always loved playing games, so now that I am starting a family of my own, I've been collecting old favorites for my own ""game library."" The Game of Life was one of the first games I purchased, but I could not have been more disappointed in the quality of the ""new and improved"" game.The game I grew up with had the buildings, bridges, houses, etc. permanently embedded into the game board. With the new game, these 3D decorations come off and and have to be placed on the board each time you play. This is my main complaint with the new game. Every time you accidently knock the board or brush one of the buildings with your sleeve, they fall off. Add to this the age-old problems of people not staying in the cars and the spinner not working properly (it's worse in the new game, by the way) and The Game of Life becomes a game of frustration.After one game with the new game board, our family decided we would not play the game again. I am now looking on auction sites trying to find one of the ""old fashioned"" game boards. They really took a step backwards with this one."
Very Happy with the purchace...All the nurses and that for Mom take their turns with it also..
I originally need only one set for my large german shephard so that he would not have to bend over so far. I ended up ordering three different sizes based on my three dogs eating habits. Two out of three were made very well and one was a little defective but it still worked. The stainless steel bowls keep their water cool and they have been drinking more of it. So overall my dogs are quite pleased with the purchase and therefore so am I.
My puppy loves it. She gets to play with it like a toy. Chew on it too. It holds her dental treat so its easier for her to hold the toy and chew the treat at the same time.
"So many dogs, so many walks, why not make them all enjoyable? The Gentle Leader is great for dogs and great for dog owners and walkers. No unnecessary pressure on neck/throat/joints. My dog now tips his head to help me place the Gentle Leader over his head. Our earth angels give us the best, now we can return the favor."
"I have been stalking this perfume for months. The first time I tried it on, the cashier at Target said, ""Mmmm... somebody smells good!"". So, every time I went in Target, I took a spritz. Last night, I was shopping with a friend, and after trying it on again, he grabbed the box, put it in the cart and said he was buying it for me. So, I guess he liked it too, lol. When I got home, I had my daughter, my brother and my husband smell it on me. They all loved it! It is soft, sweet and long lasting."
"well, I'm happy with my dashboard driver, I've placed on my desk, and when I'm bored just push the botton and vader say something like "" I am your father....(breath) "", hahahah that always makes me laugh.. xDmust buy."
This has a light floral clean scent. I like smelling it on myself. It is not overpowering like many colognes out there. It was given to me as a gift but I would definately spend money on it.
I bought the Oster Pet Nail Grinder because I was taking our dog in every 2 weeks to a month to have his nails grinded. This grinder works well and has already paid for itself. It is very easy to use. We've only had it for about a month so I do hope it holds up well with use.
"Don't waste your $$. Nothing that the ads claim about this thing worked for me. It simply does not make your hair look even close to as smooth and pretty as the infomercial, nor is it easy to use as they show it. An overpriced piece of junk, and a total disappointment!"
"Hate to admit it, but my cat is getting way up there in age, and decided that the litter box was a little too inconvenient to use, and used the corner of the living room to do the number 1. Well, I cleaned that up, but a few days later, she decided to use the bedroom closet to leave another liquid gift. That cat now lives outside.LITERALLY hours of soaking, scrubbing, chemicals, the ""vinegar and baking soda"" trick later, the stain seemed to be gone, but a day or two later, THAT ODOR would return. More scrubbing, soaking, etc, and that would cure the problem for two days or so, but THAT ODOR would return again. I was ready to literally cut out areas of carpet.I found Simple Solution recommended on another web site, so I came to Amazon, and ordered some. Used it in the living room, ONCE, (thoroughly soaking the problem area, down to the pad -- that's important) and let it dry by itself.... no blotting. It's been three weeks and there is NO ODOR left, even with the nose to the carpet method. It's been one week for the bedroom closet, and I mean NO SMELL is left behind, other than a slight, slight, perfume smell from the Simple Solution. I have since vacuumed and steam cleaned the areas, hoping that the agitation wouldn't ""wake up"" the cat odors. They didn't, and I couldn't be more happier.The only thing I changed, was that I emptied a bottle of the Scrubbing Bubbles battery operated spray bottles, rinsed it out, and put the Simple Solution in it, so I wouldn't have to squeeze the spray trigger two thousand times to saturate the soiled area."
"This ball is certainly indestructible, but my dog doesn't seem to enjoy it very much. We have hardwood floors and the plastic ball is extremely noisy on them, whether it is rolling or bouncing. I'm afraid it will roll into a wooden piece of furniture and make a dent in it, the ball is so tough. The only thing my dog can do with this 6"" ball is roll it around. She can't get her teeth around it, so normally she doesn't want anything to do with it. This would probably be a fun ball for outside in the grass if I had gotten the smaller version. Even though my dog is a medium-large sized dog, the 6"" ball is just too big."
"My son loves his V-smile, he plays it constantly. It really is a great product but I have a hard time believing this particular game is designed for a child under 6 years old, even though it is labeled for 4-7 year old children. There is a certain game where it is very difficult making the trains turn on the tracks in the direction of the letters. This is impossible for a young child I end up struggling with it, it is hard even for an adult to get that little train to turn! I don't think they properly tested this game. It is a cute idea and if you don't mind sitting there thoughout the game and helping with the difficult situations you'll be fine."
"I don't actually dislike the product, my son likes it too. But the manufacturer could have done a better job. I also took off the deflector but my son actually likes it."
"I received this for Christmas. Really like it. I like that there are all kinds of additional attachments but cannot find refills in stores, must order from Amazon and it takes 4-6 weeks to receive - Too long."
"I bought this item for my golden retriever at the suggestion of several friends who told me it was the best thing since sliced bread. They all said you only have to do it once a month and it seriously cuts down on the shedding. That is a bunch of bull!!! I spent almost an hour on Daisy the second time I used it and there is not much of a decrease in her shedding. I still have to vacume everday and it is sooo not worth the $50.00 I spent on it!!! Save your money, and buy a regular dog brush! Trust me there is no difference!"
"I had done quite a bit of reading and came across some chatter about this horse/pet product causing wonderful results on humans. This conditioner is marketed as a regrowth/rebuilder/repairer for animals' coats, skin, hoofs, paws. The claims of human hair regrowth/thickening were what interested me. There are quite a few comparisons to a similar product, Ovation Cell Therapy that is purported to be more expensive w/ similar or same ingredients. I have not tried Ovation nor have I bothered to do an ingredient comparison, but I can tell you that Ovation's manufacturer (DH Labs) = its parent company is EQyss - the company that makes Mega-Tek.I have ordered from Amazon (twice - got the small 2 oz size first to try, loved so much, went back and ordered the 16 fl oz full size.)Instructions are to apply as a conditioner, leave on for 5 min and then rinse out. I have used on a daily basis for a month and I LOVE it! Its white consistency is a little thicker than my ordinary daily conditioner, but not as thick as a deep conditioner. It has a light almost tropical scent.I started by using as an all over conditioner, which was great, but since no one can re-grow hair at the ends, and due to the expense, I have been using on only my scalp for the past few weeks and then letting the rinsing action coat the rest of my hair like a normal conditioner.I see less hair coming out when I rinse my hair and less on my hairbrush when styling. I can't speak to regrowth (I have a LOT of hair, but it is VERY fine, so I can't tell if there is regrowth) , but I can say it certainly does make my fine, color-treated layered bobbed hair look/feel thicker, fuller and like there is more of it and the effect, once I style and spray hairspray, lasts all day!From my bottle"
"Before using this product I had never really colored my hair, but because the product was so easy to use I'll certainly be doing it much more often. I did have to bleach my hair first because its so dark, but it was worth the extra effort."
1. the retractable cord is perfect for me..as i tend to leave it out all the time and can just retract the cord and lay it out of the way2. it looks so cool3. the heat settings are perfect...i always use high4. it's not as noisy and loud as my last one5. it just seems smoother
"It's not perfect. My long-haired collie still barks but it's certainly better with the collar than without. It also seems to work better when she has a summer hair cut as the metal probes can reach her skin more easily.The other drawback of this collar is that the on/off/setting button is ANNOYING. Older models had a dial you could turn. On this model, you push and hold a little button for 2-3 seconds, let go, and the setting changes. For example, to change from correction level 1 to 2, you have to press and hold the button for 2-3 sec, then let go. If you want correction level 3, you have to do it again. After correction level 3, pressing the button and releasing takes you to Test mode. Then you can press it again to turn it off. Cycling through all of these settings is slow and frustrating, especially since you might release the button too soon (setting doesn't change) or you might hold it in too long.TIP:I have discovered a trick that I'm not sure is explained in the instructions. You can avoid cycling through all of these levels if e.g., your dog always needs correction level 3. When you're ready to turn the collar off, press and keep holding the button until you see if flash green, and then red (do NOT let go after it flashes green). When it flashes red, the unit is off. To turn it back on, press the button twice, and it will automatically take you back to the level you used last. [If I hadn't discovered this 'feature' of the collar, I think I would have given up on it a long time ago.]OVERALL:I would still buy this collar. I trust the brand in terms of my pet's safety. I just wish it were more effective at curbing the barking and that it weren't so annoying to use."
"I started using Bella B Tummy Honey Butter when I was around 30 weeks pregnant (with twins). I previously used Palmers Tummy Butter, but couldn't find it in stores anymore. When looking for it online, I came across this and after reading all the positive reviews decided to give it a try. I was having a lot of problems with itching. I can honestly say it hasn't offered relief for me personally from that standpoint. I since have begun having problems with my entire body itching and can't seem to get much relief. I've tried many different topical products to no avail. My OB says it is due to hormones and since I am allergic to benadryl there really isn't anything that is safe for both me and the boys to try. So, I won't blame this product for not getting rid of the itch problem. Anyway, I slather this on very liberally every night. It is not ""non-greasy"". I wear a cotton camisole to bed each night so as not to make a mess of my sheets. It does seem to soak into my hands rather quickly, though. A tub will last me right at two weeks. The first two tubs I bought (in my first shipment) the texture was a bit gritty, but not in a rough, scratchy, irritating way. The third tub that I have begun using (different shipment) is not gritty, but rather very smooth. At 35 weeks pregnant now with just over 11 lbs of babies in me, my belly has really blossomed. I swear I'm bigger at lunchtime than I am when I get up in the morning. :-D I don't have a single stretch mark, at all, anywhere! I attribute it as much to this as anything."
I had heard great things said about the Furminator from friends so when shopping for it....I looked at alot of places and seen the price always around $50. I was able to purchase it thru Amazon for $30 which included shipping. It has worked just as my friends had told me except I was able to buy it for much less than they did.
"Transformers Movie Leader MegatronThis product is really awesome. Difficult to transform to vehicle mode, but then that's part of the fun. Don't buy it for your young kid though. It's for older kids like me (30). I'd recommend for any Transformer fan though. Overall it is well worth it."
First of all this frong looks nothing like the picture. It has no body to it and is almost all long strings for the hair. IT looks a lot bigger in the picture than it really is. Any kind of dog could stread this in minutes. I was afraid to even give this to my dog for fear he'd eat it in two bites.
"This came out much redder than advertized. I have naturally dark brown hair and I haven't used hair dye in over 6 years, so I thought that the dye would turn my hair a sortof lighter brown like the box advertised on the side. However, my hair is darker and has a deep red (almost purple) hue to it. I dislike it!! Also, this isn't as easy to apply as the video adverts say it is - luckily my roomate was a willing participant. I am giving it two stars due to the misadvertising of the color and the difficulty of application. I should have chosen another color."
"I liked the Basis Sensitive Skin bar soap because it's non-drying, unlike many others I've tried before. It rinses clean and is mild enough to use anytime. It felt very creamy, almost like lotion, but it wasn't greasy. I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin."
My son loves this toy. He also got a real bike and is loving riding it even more. Very smart idea for a game.
This is a fun toy but getting the balls to move to the other side does not require much effort from my 1&2 yr old.
"I started using this item yesterday. I have been using it as well as the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Gel, and already, in about 36 hours, my face is reasonably clearer. I have been using the Neutrogena blackout scrub/acne wash for about 6 months now, but it just wasn't able to keep up with my acne, and so far, it seems this can."
"Junk. It does not hear the yapping pomeranian nor does it hear the booming beast dog, even on full setting. The only way I could activate it was to stomp by it, it seems to respond to the wrong frequency and amplitude. Once activated, it only peaked the pomeranians interest to bark even more."
My little girly dog looks precious in this coat. It's really easy to get on and off her. It's a great value as it is very well made and keeps her warm. It's really easy to launder. I'm glad that I bought it.
"My six month-old loves this toy. He is obsessed with tags, and this provides him with lots of different things to touch and feel. He loves to chew on the rings. Most importantly, it's light enough for him to pick up on his own. It attaches easily to a stroller or car seat with attaching rings (buy those separately). I would recommend this to anyone with a baby!"
"The only question is, how many people should I buy one for? I don't think of myself as ""mentally ill"" and the arrogant fools who gave this a 1-star rating in the guise of being sensitive or politically correct need a slap of reality.I'm certain they didn't even buy this toy, so what are they doing reviewing it?Don't feel sorry and demand pity for what, despite degrees or whathaveyou, you obviously don't understand and can't accept. So much for compassion!"
"This is a decent product however after trying at least 3 bottles over a year or so Ive found some don't smell the same as others at all. Must be a shelf life or something ? My real complaint is that the cologne comes out red. Either its red to begin with or the dye on the bottle is tainting it. Its pale red , but red nonetheless.I wish they'd revise that and put a ""best used by"" date or something on it as well."
"I love this toy! It's soft so you know you're baby is safe even if she tries to bump her head on the toy or when she's trying to eat it because she's teething or just like to eat things. It's colorful so you'll get her attention with it. It's educational because of the colors, plus you can use it to coy her to crawl (my baby is in the process of crawling). Plus, when you play with your little one and roll it, it has a tiny bell sound inside. This is a must have for every mothers or first time parents like I am. ADORABLE!"

"Purchasing this toy is simply throwing money away. I am astounded at the amount of things breaking on this truck and trailer set, and the companion stable my daughter was given as a gift. The concept is great - the opportunities could have been endless for play if my daughter was not bringing pieces to me one by one from these sets. She is 5 years old and gentle with her toys, but this toy simply can not handle being played with even as intended. It is also beyond repair as screws fall out of the door and can't be re-set due to the angle, mirrors snapped off, hinges broke. We were without receipts for this item or it would have gone back the first day. We have had a much better experience with the Schleich jeep and trailer purchased for her 3 year old sister. Again, these Breyer play accessories are a waste of money being so poorly made."
"Great shipping and service, product was as stated and in perfect condition when it arrived! 5 stars"
"This is the best curling iron ever. Smooth curls, no frizz, long lasting. Also, ordering from Amazon is fantastic. Placing the order is easy and shipping is always super fast!"
This is the best moisturizer for sensitive skin. I find that this product takes care of some of my skin ailments and produces a better complexion.
"I love the fragrance of this soap, it's long lasting and fresh. It also makes my skin feel nice and smooth not tight like some soaps. I live in a very hard water area too and still get lots of lather."
"I don't understand the recent reviews claiming that this is a knockoff version of the original Zino. I just received my order from Amazon. For comparison, I have a bottle of Zino that I bought in a department store about 7 years ago; and the new cologne that just arrived has a very similar fragrance, close enough to satisfy me. The bottle and packaging of the new product sure do look authentic, also, so I'm not sure how other customers are so sure this is a knockoff. One final note"
"I have been using Frownies for years, usually purchased via mail order companies, but now with the ease and quickness of Amazon you can get them within a week. I try to apply these between my eyes almost every night, and even if I miss a night my frown lines are much improved. I know this product is the eyes/mouth one, but I find this one better for my forehead creases than the regular forehead Frownies (however I often keep both in my medicine cabinet). If you don't want Botox or can't afford it, this is a reliable alternative that really makes a difference. Don't pay attention to the naysayers who tell you it is uncomfortable, you hardly feel it on your face because they use a super-light all natural vegetable adhesive that leaves no morning residue. One thing"
"I was having trouble with strays coming on our porch and back deck. This would set off our two cats, who would then transfer their aggression for this intruder onto one another. Cat fights in the living room are not fun to try to breakup.I found this after some research. It does what it says it will. A silent ( to humans and most other animals) tone that cats don't like and shoos them away.Tried it on my two before putting it outside, and it did not startle or freak them out, they did quickly leave the room. Have not had any outside troulbe since.It's totally safe and does not bother the birds or the squirrels, which is nice since the cats enjoy watching them from the windows."
"This dryer ruined my hair!!! At first, after I bought it, I really liked how quickly it dried my hair. After using it every day for about 8 days, I noticed a strange smell, but didn't know what it was. (It didn't smell like burning hair, more like home perm solution.) I switched from high heat (which had been fine with my Conair) to the medium setting, and the smell went away, but the damage continued. I have medium length fine straight hair, and the ends became dry and frizzy and began to break off. After a month, my hair has turned to brittle straw, won't curl, and is breaking all over. Also, I color my hair with semi-permanent coloring, and the now frizzy ends absorb more of the coloring, giving a strange look. I realize now that this dryer was working so quickly because it was WAY too hot, even on the medium setting. Not sure if the ions were a factor, but it doesn't matter. After reading the other reviews here, I feel lucky not to have experienced sparks or flames. I'm getting a short cut and a new dryer and waiting for my hair to grow out. I'm extremely upset, and definitely will not purchase another Revlon product."
"I bought the 4 panel pen for 2 Bichon puppies. There's more than enough room for them, their bed and a water bowl and I'm positive it will be plenty big enough when they're fully grown. It's well made and very durable. I bought this pen based on the favorable comments from others as well as advice from friends who've said their pets chewed through the fabric pens. The price is right and I couldn't be happier with it."
"very fun dollhouse, my daughter has had hers for years now. we sent one to my friends daughter and she loves it as well. the kids find cool ways to play with it and as all playmobil it is extremely durable..."
Great idea needs a lot of improvement.Poor picture. Microphone is a joke. Doesn't pick up your voice unless you have your mouth right on it and how are you supposed to sing when you are eating the mic. Big dissapointment!
Already given a review. I do not want my name or email showing except when ordering items.
"I wanted to change my hairdryer to get a lighter and a more quiet one! but I think I haven't made a good purchase, this hair dryer is too heavy and also makes lots of noise. But don't back up, overall it's not that bad!"
"I have been having eye irritation and issues for a while now. Every eye makeup remover burns and irritates my eyes. However, when I use jojoba oil, my make up comes off easily and there is no irritation. It is the best thing ever!!!! You can read the other reviews to see the other AMAZING benefits of it :)"
"I wasnt sure about using a prong collar for my dog, it looked like it hurt and looked uncomfortable. I have a lab/pit mix, best dog ever, lovable and playful. But he loved pulling me outside and chase after other dogs. Became a job instead of a lesiure walk. I had to resort to a prong collar and it started to work instantly. I was impressed. its only temporary for training. I dont even use it anymore and he is doing great. If the dog was not responding to the collar i probable would have discontinued because Im sure it would have hurt him. When dogs are pups, the mother would uselly grab them by there neck. Its only pressure on the dog."
"I have worn Beautiful by Estee Lauder for over 15 years. I get compliments often. Budget minded, I needed to find a better price that retail and Amazon was almost the most inexpensive one I could find.Beautiful By Estee Lauder For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5 Oz Unboxed."
"This is a great heat protector for the hair, it left my hair soft and shiny!"
"I have EXCEPTIONALLY sensitive skin, especially around my eyes. Before I started using this cream, I would get scaly, flakey skin all around my eyes every change in the seasons, and always in winter. It was so bad that I couldn't wear makeup many days in the winter. I couldn't use ANY moisturizer on them, because all of them caused sensitivity and red bumps. This was a miracle cure to end this cycle.It is the ONLY cream I can use on my eyes that doesn't cause redness or burning, and never hurts my skin. One reviewer mentioned that they wish there was SPF in this, citing it as a negative trait. I have to say the opposite - I avoid sunscreens because of sensitive skin, and I am happy to find this as one of the only eye creams without added chemicals or sunscreens.I constantly use this day and night, along withCelestial Moisturizer by LUSH, and then layerPhilosophy Eye Believe Peptide Eye Balm, 0.5 Ounceon top at night. This has been my routine for about 5 years now, with the Eye Believe added only in the last year (since turning 29), to pump up the wrinkle fighting a bit. I have noticed considerable changes over this time around my eyes, which look younger, less wrinkled, and more rested, even without the peptide cream.A few negatives"
Excellent service and good quality merchandise.Item was delivered in great shape well before the expected date!
"Have you ever had what seemed to be the perfect toy for your child only to have it die, over and over again? In front of your child?I've bought 3 of these during the course of 2 years, after the broken replacement remotes (by the manufacturer) were replaced.I wish my son had never seen this- he's too young to be disappointed like this.The remote controls simply break. Two of them came out of the box broken.Customer service is the very worst."
"We were really impressed- just got back from playing with the heli with the 6 year old recipient, dad, and family. A ton of fun! We were dive-bombing each other, and no one got hurt (including the heli). The adults were extremely impressed with the durablility, and surprised it wasn't scratched, even after the beating the poor thing took from the kids. Not much steering control, but the up and down controls are very receptive. My husband now really wants one for himself, and I'm sad to see that somehow the same heli now costs $80, when we bought it one month ago from here for $24.95. What's up, Amazon??"
"i have a very long hair and I refuse to use chemicals on my hair. This product last about 9 weeks on my hair.I have to use 3 box of this for my 3'-5"" long hair."
I use this product on my kids. You know that brown stuff that accumulates on kids necks and sometimes behind their ears no matter how much they wash? This will get it off!
"little smaller than i wanted (yes, i know the dimensions are in the description), guess my puppy is growing faster than i thought, but its so cute on him. every dachshund should have a spiked collar. and yes, it is real leather. i'll be ordering a bigger one when he grows out of this one. spikes are sharp so it'll have to come off at night. looks great on my little guy though."
"My eight year old loves this game, whenever he can coax it away from his father! I recommend you buy two so no one has to wait a whole afternoon for his or her turn. END"
"Great toy - I had ordered these for party favors for my son's 7th birthday party. He was having a knight birthday party and when we brought out the party bags and the boys saw what was in them, they were so excited - to say the least! They loved them! One of the boys that got them was my other son and he played with them for 3 days straight. Great set for the price!"
"I use this with my French students to teach them about physical traits and posing questions. Teenage kids love it just as much as the little ones, especially when they are learning a new language. I can see how this can be used in other foreign language classes. The competitive streak also adds to some students ability to learn. Who doesn't want to win?This is a fantastic way to teach studnets and your kids! The only complaint I have is that the characters in this game are not very culturally diverse. Maybe in the next edition. Are you reading this, Milton Bradley?"
"I love this so much that I had to buy a gallon of it. If you follow the directions, you will want to cuddle your dog on a daily basis."
"I have purchased these fur ball toys for my two cats several times in the past and have been very satisfied with the quality of the product. This last batch was of poor quality and some of the fur balls were already falling apart. Despite the cheap construction of the fur balls, they are still the favorite toys amongst the cats."
This is a version of a matching memory game. Our grandkids loved this and beat us playing every time. It is as durable as any card game and larger in size than a standard deck. This is helpful for small hands. I have noticed that they used it a lot and learned a lot at first but don't play it so much any more. That more be because of the phase they are in than the game. I think they will come back to it periodically.
"This was great fun for my grand dogs, two smallish mix breeds with attitude and very sharp teeth. It lasted about a month. They were very aggressive with the toy and really tear at it in a game of tug after they get the squirrels out.This was the 3rd hide the squirrel toy I have given them and will give another as they have so much fun with it."
"I moved back home to my mothers place of residence Wed September 1, 2010 and she has two cats and a dog, I have one cat. My cat at the time was pregnant, she had her kittens Tuesday Sept 7, 2010. I kept my cat in my room a few days so she could calm down and get use to the move. Finally, I let her roam the house and she was fine until she came in contact with the dog. She growled and hissed, attacked and then ran, the dog didn't back down but also did not bark, scratch or bite. The next day she was lying close to the dog with no problem. The morning after, Sept 5, 2010 my dog was put to sleep. The only ones left were the cats. Unfortunately, unlike the dog after she encountered the cats she didn't become friends after they growled and snapped at each other. Actually, after she had her kittens she even started to bully one cat. She would seek him out and attack. It has gotten to the point where the other cats are afraid to eat or roam around the house. I just got the bottle of At ease Thur Sept 9, 2010. My mother and I lost sleep over the random attacks from my cat in the middle of the night. I sprayed it everywhere. I was hoping it would relax them enough to where they can at least not attack each other. It did not work for my cat at all. So, she is now confined to my room.The reason why I gave it an two stars is because one cat is a scaredy cat. The funny thing about him is he is a main coon (in other words huge) yet he hides. Since I sprayed, ""At Ease"", he doesn't run from my cat anymore. He hid majority of the time and only came out to eat and as soon as he heard my door open, he would disappear. Once I sprayed, ""At Ease"", he stopped hiding and was acting like normal. He still growls at my cat, when she growls at him but he isn't in hiding anymore. Too bad I can't get the one she picks on, out of hiding and he is the friendly cat, who loves everybody.Since, it has only been a day for me, I am still going to continue using and update my review if there is any changes. I am thinking maybe the cats were so stressed from the loss of my dog and the cat fights and new kittens that maybe the, ""At Ease"" isn't strong enough to calm them down at this time. I will see...It is Sept 19, 2010 and I sprayed the At Ease all over the house for a few more days to see if there were any difference. I stopped using it because it seemed pointless. The main coon still picks up for myself so it is uncertain if it were from the spray or just him having enough of her taking over."
I was very pleased with the quiddler card games that I ordered. Delivery was fast and the packaging was secure. Thank you.
"My daughter, age 4, got some money for her birthday this past weekend. I took her out to pick out something to buy. She found this game. At first I looked at and tried to talk her into something else. But she insisted and we bought it. We got home and tried it out. Not only was this an easy game to learn (balances different sized shapes on the clown to keep it from falling over) but my son, 20 months, also loved it. There aren't very many games that we can all play together. They both thought it was great!! And the cats enjoyed when the pieces would fall on the floor...they would chase them around. Win for everyone!"
it was great not as time consuming as i thought it was going to be
"I have used Lupine products for years for Dogs, Cats and Key chains. As for the collars manufacturing quality, materials, fit, guarantee, available patterns an colors cannot be compared, they last for years. And one more great and rare thing they are MADE IN USA nuff said."
This game is really really easy to play with very short instructions and minimal rules. The concept is simple
"This product looks and works as advertised. The mobile worked very well and was very attractive to watch- it definitely kept my baby's attention at times when we wanted him to stay in his crib. The music was mediocre in quality, and didn't seem to sooth my baby. He liked to hit all the buttons on it, so regardless of the music duration, it was always off long before that. The thing I hated the most was the remote. Unless your nursery is the size of a barn, I'm not sure why you would want a remote. It's just another piece of junk that takes AA batteries and clutters up a tabletop. That kind of poor engineering is just a waste of money.I've had this product for 3 years now. Our second child has actually used it far more heavily than our first did. He turns it on each morning and listens to it on his own for a while before fully waking up. Sometimes hell do the same when he goes to bed. Everything has held up well over the years. I still hate the remote, though. i would have preferred to save $5 instead."
"Bought this for son's 12th birthday, he has been a Godzilla fan since he was 2, this toy was an addition to his growing collection of Godzilla items."
"This is a very fun logic based game. Every one can play from little kids to the ""smartest"" adults. I was introduced to this game at a friends house and was hooked. I purched a deluxe version (more levels) the next day. I have shown to my wife and and daughter and now when we have family dinner nights my daughter comes over, I fire up the BBQ and out comes the Traffic Jam game. Great fun for all."
"This thing is really pretty cool.We have ordered over 100 of these tater tots for a friend of ours.Very durable little toys, for sure."
This is the fourth Litter Maid litter box I own. The LME9000 Mega is the best one I own. I like the larger box and the removable rake. I like the improved raking mechanism you don't have to worry about litter getting in the tracks.With the new removable rake and raking track it is hard to over fill this box with litter.The Mega was easy to assemble. The only complaint I have is that it is harder to get the collection box out to dump than the other ones I have. But this will not stop me from buying another when one of the smaller models wear out.
"I love this fragrance. I can never get enough of it. The scent is fresh, not ""heavy"" or ""perfumey"", if you know what I mean.If you are woman who likes fresh, happy, optimistic scents, with a splash of citrus, this is for you."
"I have bought my cat many elaborate toys, but only this piece of wire with cardboard attached to the ends can drive him crazy.Be sure to buy a few of these at once, because cats tend to chew the cardboard off."
I didn't taste it but my sister's dog licks her own butt and I'm pretty sure I wouldn't like the taste of that. The dog seems to like the red one she has so I bought a black one.
"I bought this camera for my young son who sees me using my camera all the time. I thought he'd get a kick out of tagging along and taking his own photos. I was right. He loves it. He's only 2 1/2, so I haven't even bothered loading film in the camera. He's just happy clicking away. The camera is wonderful. Absolutely worth the money."
"I have average-shiny hair, so I got this hoping it would add some pop. It definitely lightened my hair a little like others said, but I acutally like the lightening...it blends my grown out blonde with my natural ash brown well. As for what it is intended for...shine...it did not do much. My hair looks the same shinyness. I would not buy this again, but it didn't ruin my hair as others said."
My daughter loves this castle. But it is a piece of junk! I can not believe that they charge so much for something that falls apart! The balloon that comes with it breaks for good. There is no fixing it. The ends of the balloon are cheap plastic that attachs to the basket to carry the ponies. It bends easy and breaks. The rest of the parts fall apart. She has to keep popping them back into place. I don't regret buying it though. My daughter plays with it alot. Mainly because she loves the ponies.
"I love this pen! Its big enough that my little fur baby has room to play, but it can also be folded in so that it takes up less space while in use. It can be used indoor and out and its tall enought she cant jump over."
"My cats LOVE this fountain! It holds a lot of water, stays clean and fresh from the internal filter, and the sound of running water definitely attracts pets to want to drink from it more often than their typical water dish which helps eliminate them from getting urinary tract infections! The motor is quiet, you can hardly hear it so its not a nuisance to have and the water doesn't splatter at all! Plus its easy to clean. A couple of small issues, try to not drop anything on the plastic reservoir on back as I found out the hard way that if it has a deep crack in it, it will cause your fountain to overflow all the time and you'll have to purchase a new one off of the Drinkwell website which are about $20 to replace. Also I wish they built one of these specifically for cats as mine have to reach to get to the water and the stream is a little hard, but they still use it no problem and LOVE it."
"I got a new dog and her bark is very high pitched and very loud, to the point that it would cause me physical pain in my ear drum and at times I would get vertigo and feel dizzy. I researched products and decided on this one because it didn't seem cruel like the shock collars. It was a great price so I tried it out. It worked immediately. My dog stopped barking the first time it sprayed her, she let out one bark, she was sprayed and stopped barking. I let her wear it for two days and each time it worked, and each time I said to her the word ""spray"". Then on the third day, every time she barked I just said ""spray"" and she stopped barking. Now after a couple of weeks she doesn't bark at all and if she want's my attention to go outside or get food she uses a very low muffled sound. It's an amazing product, I am so very happy."
"I bought this item to reduce the barbershop costs. If you use it with the oil it won't be so noisy, the problem is that the clips are cheap made and the make an annoying sound when on the trimmer.My came with hair on it, as if it was ""TESTED"", i could't believe what my eyes were seen. I used some products to disinfect it before use.I have used it 4 times now so i can say it,s a good item because of the price."
"I bought two of these sets, one for my house and one set for grandchildren. Everyone loves it. My neice and two of my friends want to order it. It's safe under the tree for babies. The toddlers love to play with it and the preschool children like to tell the story while playing with the figures. Great idea Fisher-Price!"
"The product is great, a five star product no doubt, one I've used before and really like. The price seemed right--wonderful, in fact--but the shipping charge from this particular vendor more than tripled the price of the shampoo. I'll buy the shampoo again--from another vendor."
"My 10 year old German-Shepherd mix has had arthritis since puppyhood, and has always walked with a limp on her left front leg. As she grew older, she blew out both knees (2 TPLO surgeries), and developed arthritis in her hips, pelvis, both knees, left elbow and her ankles. We've tried most of the products out there over the years, and I never saw a difference in her walk.Finally, last year, the surgeon who did her most recent knee surgery suggested we try GlycoFlex III. After about 3 weeks, for the first time in her life, she was walking without a limp. I had to ask friends to watch her walk and tell me if she was limping because I couldn't believe it could be true.We started out with 2 tablets a day, but now she gets one in the evening and 1/2 in the morning. She doesn't particularly like to eat them, so I break them up into her dinner and breakfast.Amazon has the best price I've seen on GlycoFlex III, anywhere."
We looked at several different steps prior to deciding to purchase these steps. Our dog took to the steps right away and they function very well. They are extremely sturdy yet light enough to move readily as needed. I highly recommend this product!
"Excellent on hard surfaces like concrete. Only wish the handle was not wood, as it rots. These used to be all aluminum."
It does the job but I don't like it. It's not powerful enough. The speed of trimmer is slow. If you are looking for a kind of professional trimmer - this product is not for you. But pro-trimmer costs two or three times more. Not recommended.
"To begin the packaging/shipping was perfect. There was no damage and was deliver on time. The game itself as you can see from the picture is not like the original. This to me was no big deal at first until we started playing the game with our 3 year old daughter. The board is riddled with confusion constantly guessing which direction you need to be going do to the lack of indication. The player pieces are extremely large thus causing trouble for players to share a space. If 3 land on the same spot, forget it just put the others in the middle of the board or suffer frustration. The spinner works well enough to get the job done and there really isn't much more to say about this product other than make every effort to find the older version or at least a different one from this. :D Hope this helped!"
"I received a two pack of batteries and the batteries don't last more than a week in my dogs barking collar. These are a waste of money, but i am not pleased with the performance on the dog collar neither."
"I bought this item based upon the reviews found here at Amazon. Yes, it is small and powerful, easily carried. It is just about right, almost.From day one the bearings sound like they are going out. Did I get a defective unit? If yours sounds like mine, you are wondering when it will be going out. But it still works so I keep using it. Does the ""going out sound"" bother us. You bet it does!UPDATED"
"ladies it's another must have and it's another winner by jlo, her perfume is fantastic i haven't purchased anything but wonderful scents by jlo and the seller is equally awesome, packs it great and ships quickly. A MUST HAVE, LADIES!!"
"I love the original Pink Sugar. The Chocolate Lovers had great reviews, but when I wear it, people always ask me if I smell chocolate. That is not the result I want from my perfume."
"I have a one year old Boxer, I was having several issues with him.I live on a few acres and allow my dog to run off leash, however when I would tell him "" come "" he would either look at me like I was crazy or just run the other way.After one day on this collar, he was amazing, I only had to shock him twice before he was coming when called with the alert sound, and by the same night was doing it with only my command. Im sure this will still be a work in progress and I do not plan on stopping the training collar, however it makes a big difference !A second problem I have is walking him, he wants to be out in front and pulling you down the road or trail, I was able to walk a trail for the first time with out a sore arm while using this collar after one shock and several audio alerts he was learning to stay close and not pull.I will also say that I am only using the second level of shock out of eight, and it is plenty to get his attention.If you have a hard headed dog or one with bad habits spend the money for one of these !"
"Baby Doll Paris is better than I expected. I do not know what the notes are supposed to be, but, upon spraying on my skin, the first thing I smelled was what smelled like a mixture of verbena and lime. Slowly some floral notes of rose emerged and what smelled like a touch of pineapple or subtle ginger.Actually, this fragrance reminded me of a more fruity, less sweet, more subtle version of BS Fantasy. Most of YSL's perfumes disappear from my skin in mach speed, but Baby Doll Paris is very long lasting. It also smells good on fabric. Though, I don't believe this is really original smelling, it is good in a very girly casual sort of way.Babydoll isn't bottleworthy for me, as I have other similiar scents which have a sexier feel that I like better. Tho, this is definitely one you should try."
"Replaced an old Buddy pet bed we had for about 10 years. We travel with two doxies and this dog bed is comfortable, safe and allows them to see out of car or truck."
"This is a great pull toy for kids. As they pull it the wooden slacks that make up its body clack together. It works best on wood or tile floors but really any hard surface works including sidewalks. The toy itself is made from rubber wood trees, the company Plan Toys uses the rubber wood after the tree has stopped producing latex and would otherwise just be burned. The glue and paint are non toxic and the finished product is cute and durable."
"I bought this game for my family after playing it at my daughter's friend's house. It was a blast. My dad is not a big game-board type player, but he loved this game. We had so much fun. It gets especially ""challenging"" when the cards you are holding do not really describe any favorite of the Whoozit...makes you really think about what they could like out of the cards you are holding. We even played choosing the card we think the Whoozit would like the least, and then putting them in front of the coins least favorite to best (highest points for least favorite coin to lowest coin for most favorite card). Either way we had lots of fun! My daughter is 7 1/2 and loves this game, as well as the other Cranium games we have (Cadoo, Balloon Lagoon, and Hullabaloo).[...]"
This is a nice crate bed for your money. They ship fast I had mine in just a couple of days
"I've been waiting for a Wonder-Man figure for awhile. I have one based on the short lived Avengers cartoon but while fairly cool it does look quite different from all of the comic book versions.Anyway, on to the figure at hand. The figure itself looks pretty good but I thought the choice of his vehicle was a little odd. If he had to have a vehicle to ride on I would have thought it should be more like the sky cycles that were used in some issues of the West Coast Avengers.The Yellowjacket figure is a nice inclusion. Unfortunately mine is defective. I can plug him into the back of the WM figure but only upside down."
"Unscented one didn't work out for me. I thought it would be better since i can use it with my favorite cologne, but it's a bad news bears. Just buy the scented one. I bought this to seduce my professor so she can give me a better grade just for the lulz, but no it doesn't work.Let's talk about the scent itself. Even though it's unscented it smells a little plastic with oil. If that's what pheromone smells like then i have no clue. There wasn't any label on the bottle what so ever so it may/may not be a legitimate ""Scent of Eros"". I may be wrong, but i didn't get any response from any ladies so far. So like i've said BUY THE SCENTED ""SCENT OF EROS"".NOTE"
This cheap price does not indicate cheap quality --- There are many crimp/waiver irons out there that are much more money than this one -- but this one is awesome --- the barrel size it perfect --- not too small to make your hair look frizzy --- just perfect -- with three barrels it takes no time to do your whole head -- I leave some straighter pieces underneath and this creates a very nice contrast -- I usually don't take the time to write a review but I just wanted people to know --- great buy --- I would buy it as a gift for others
"I give this litter box 3 stars because it's made well and looks great. My cat would pee in it, but not poop in it. He would cry....then go on my comforter.He never figured out how to stand on it. Always went backwards or sideways.The manufacturer has a great website with many videos of cats doing their business on it. I think it just depends on the cat.I just think that trying to force a cat to do his business within a 8"" x 5"" oval is just too stressful for them. Plus, if your cat likes to diligently cover up his business when he's done, he won't like this. Mine would step down and try to reach into the hole to cover up his pee, but couldnt really get the job done. He was confused and tried and tried.By the way, this entire box is the size of your own toilet lid! It's quite compact and snazzy looking. I really think it would be absolutely PERFECT to train a kitten on this. The kitten would be small, and wouldnt mind the small area to use. But trying to get my 1 year old to ""downsize"" just wouldnt work.The actual area to put litter was about 12"" x 10"". So you will use very little litter. I'm thinking it's a must to use clumping litter with this box, though, because the ""pan"" part is so small, theres no room for scraping and foraging without getting litter everywhere. Scoopable litter would be easy to scoop out the clumps though.Give it a try if you have a kitten. Didn't work for my young adult cat."
"I bought this thinking that it was the greatest thing since sliced cheese. My son always loves playing with tags, and he just threw this and never looked at it again. I tried getting him to play with it and pay attention to the tags he got what it was and didn't like it at all. The mouse inside is nearly impossible for a baby to come out and when you do pull on it, it doesn't go back inside unless you put it back in and I think that's just poor design. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and I am really sad that I paid for it as my sons gift."
"shipping was really good,and i got what i ordered on time. will buy from again,alittle pricy but my little dog likes them."
I have used this style of hotcurlers for over 35yrs & LOVE LOVE LOVE them! So accomadating & portable & easy to use & VERY cost effective!!! Please DONT stop making them!!!
I love this giraffe. I got it for the nursery for my daughter coming in January and its huge but perfect. Its so hard to find tall plush animals that done cost a fortune and this was definatly perfect. My two year son loves it and it seems durable with him romping with it for a lil while
I prefer wax coated cards such as what you'd find in a casino that are usually found in a department store. They are more durable and don't fray at the edges as readily as what are provided in this game. Otherwise the game is fine.
"I run a dog hotel, Barkingham Palace, outside Slidell, LA & average about 25 guests a night. We're always playing ball w/the chuckit stick & use the Air Kong Squeaker Tennis balls; the dogs LOVE them! They squeak all the way back to me so I can chuck it again. Sometimes the squeaker doesn't last too long, but the enjoyment they get is tremendous! I even give them out as gifts when guests ""check out."""
you should get it mine came with starsceram and decepticone but you might not its a radom figures
"My 10 year old Springer Spaniel gets bored because she can't go out and exercise during the winter months. I bought her this for Christmas and she is rejuvenated! She loves these ""little guys"" and carries each around like they are her babies. She won't let any of the three out of her sight and they are still squeaking after 3 days of constant use."
"This really does work! I love that my dog, white maltese, does not have the tear stains on his pretty face.Angels Eyes for Dogs 30 Gram Bottle"
"This stuff really is better than Tend Skin or other anti-ingrown gels. I do think it's made a noticeable difference after one or two weeks. The problem is that there's not enough in a bottle! Or, alternatively, it's too expensive. But it's nice stuff. Warning"
"I bought this and the weekly conditioner today,and it states on the bottle it can be used on dry hair, as well as damp hair. I put on a dime-sized dollop( I have a pixie cut),and Wow! My hair feels so much softer already.I may have put a touch too much on,but still,I am amazed at the results after one try.I will put smaller amounts in from here on out,as this seems to pack a punch.Hair that is color-treated,and ""winter-ized"" year after year sure does show.It looks lifeless...no lustre.This hopefully will ""cure"" my worn-out locks. I am very optimistic, and will try, and review the weekly mask asap."
"I initially wanted to purchase the ConTech Scarecrow to ward off the half a dozen rabbits that chose to make my yard their home. But my yard is a weird L shape and I didn't want to deal with running a hose across the yard and possibly being sprayed myself. So I decided to give the CatStop a go first (the same model is used as a small animal deterrent elsewhere on Amazon).The first thing I noticed was that the sensor isn't very sensitive. After the first blast it takes a while before it resets for a second blast. In the 10 - 15 secs it takes for that to happen, the rabbits have already set up shop 2 ft in front of the CatStop and started to do their business on my lawn. I don't know what rabbits elsewhere do but the ones here stay absolutely still until they're done doing whatever it is that they're doing. Which typically includes nibbling on my grass, pooping on it and then killing it their pee.The entrance to my yard is about 10 ft wide. I expected the CatStop to prevent entry of rabbits to the rest of the yard. But the rabbits get past in on a regular basis. I'm no better off with having purchased this clunker. Just $50 poorer."
"I had no idea these calico critters were so small. They arrived and I realized I could not use them as the primary Easter toy for my granddaughter. However, I decided to put these cute little bunny critters in plastic eggs that abound on this holiday. I have collected several small toys to put in these eggs. The calico critters will be the most popular of these toys.I have two complaints about these critters, the size and the cost. The critters are much too small to play with, and the cost is prohibitive for the size.Would only recommend for collectors.prisrob 04-01-12Calico Critters Cozy Cottage Starter SetCalico Critters Caramel Cat Family"
"My daughter really wanted this item so we purchased it and 15min after she started using it the screen went to black and white. We replaced the batteries, poof!! it was color again. It looks as though this item should not be battery powered. Very cheap poor quality item. I can't beleive this was the hot Chritmas item! I know there are a lot of dissapointed purchasers out there. Buyer be afraid...be very afraid."
"without a shadow of a doubt this is the best cologne i have purchased in a while. The first time i sprayed it on, I was hooked. It doesn't have that musky Christmas tree smell that most colognes have. And the best part is that the smell lingers. I will definitely recommend this to anyone. There were even two or three women that looked back at me after i passed by."
"Purchased this product for my two eskies. Works ok, give it to them everyday on top of wet food. it fades out the undercoat of tear stain, but it doesn't stop the tear stain from being made. In other words, it makes it look good on the fur around the eye and rear end, but once the eye tears there is more stain. We keep the dogs eyes pretty dry. Also only takes away stain on very under part of the eye, not all around the eye. Overpriced for the results we have seen."
"a great buy! my child began playing with this when he was 3 months old! he loved to spin the ball and it helped him learn cause and effect. As he got older, he would pick up the ball and roll it around! he loves it! it is a favorite for him and all of his baby cousins who recommended it to us! great gift for new parents!"
I would have to say I LOVE this product. I played it once before I bought it and decided I had to have it...Since I have bought it everyone I show it to falls in love...It is a fun game to play with family or to take with you to hang out with friends...I HIGHLY Recommend this game if you like acting like a fool and having fun.
"This game is broken in so many ways I don't know where to start.....First off the rules have to be changed drastically because of the dvd format. Your team has 30 seconds to pick 5 answers (which is difficult because it's hard to discuss your answers without the other team hearing you and copying your answers (as soon as you miss one of the 5 correct answers - every question has top 5 only - it's the other teams turn to pick one selection for a chance to steal - it doesn't matter if you have the rest of the answers correct, hence the reason you need to keep your mouth shut while picking your 5 answers)This problem by itself makes this a crummy game.The other major issue are the questions.One my second play through the first 2 questions were questions we had in the first playthrough..... Maybe that was just really bad luck but we had to restart twice (that would've sucked alot more if it happened in one of the later rounds. There aren't any options for replacing a question.Beyond that is the quality of the questions (some of the ""responses"" left all of us completely bambozeled - it was hard to believe that actual human beings answered the questions). A completely different experience from the show where the questions are logical and have mostly logical responses.Lastly I would like to say that we bought this after dusting off a 20 year old version of family feud which we had a blast playing despite the age of some of the questions (we just tossed the outdated questions aside). Proof that not all change is good. They messed with a good formula and the result in this case is absolute garbage."
"I have a large capacity gas dryer. A typical dryer load would normally require 70 minutes to dry. Using four of these, this time has been cut to 50 minutes. This is about a 30% drop in time with comparable drop in energy usage.The softening of clothes is less than you would normally see using fabric softener, however; you'll not have to deal with the residue that fabric softeners normally leave behind. If you are allergy sensitive or suffer other lung ailments, this can be a big plus.Remember that over time fabric softener will build up and clog your pipes. Eliminating the need for fabric softeners is a big benefit.These will save money and will pay for themselves in a relatively short period of time. Further, you are not adding unnecessary chemicals to the environment. Plus you will be using less gas/electric, thus reducing the pollution you create.This product is highly recommended.Caution, the shipping charge on these plastic balls is very high. You can likely find the same product locally for much less. Try your local dollar store before ordering online."
"I love everything about this lotion. It has a lovely, addictive smell, it's vegetarian and not tested animals (VERY important to me), it's paraben free (paraben being a cancer-causing chemical), and the alpha hydroxy acids work wonders for keratosis.I just purchased this lotion in the last month, and the bottle says ""New Improved Hydration"" in the upper left. I'm very happy with it."
"For the past 5 years my dog has been starting his day with a greenie. He still gets excited about this morning treat and appears disappointed when I run out. Since he controls the household, I buy them."
"This iron worked so well, perfectly balanced and immediately heating up... I purchased the 1 1/2"" one for myself and the 1"" one for my daughter. It also cools down easily, so while it's a bit large for travel, it works better than my travel curlers so I have traded them out."
"Be very aware that this thing is tiny. Not at all what we expected. The description says that it is 4.5""(I admit we missed that), but that is wing tip to wing tip. The packaging also says that it weighs 1lb. My guess is that it would take 50 of them to get to a pound. Very surprised that this toy received a couple 5 star reviews."
"I have wavvy hair and have had issues with frizz when my hair is dry. I do not like the glossy type products, since I just think they make your hair look greasy. I have dry hair, only washing it every 3 days. I just had some of this in my hair, toss it around and it looks great.I have used many, many products and always go back to this!!"
"I bought this blower dryer for a identical replacement for my husband. He likes to have the brush on the dryer and with this model you can purchase replacement brushes. He loves the air/temp control options. The only downside is the brushes don't last very long and you can't order them online so a phone call is necessary - advantage for folks who prefer to speak to a ""real person."" Overall, good product which is effident buy this being his third identical dryer over probably 5+ years."
"The product has a very bad description, so I though I need to write some details. It does not specify the size, but great that they say it's 100% natural.So, it smells bad and looks very small, but my dog loves it! Maybe it's just small for my 100 lbs Cane Corso... On the back of the pack it says to give 2-3 stix a day for dogs that size. Each stick is about 5 in long and 1/2 in diameter. They are very hard, but my dog does not have any problems chewing it. It goes away in about 1 min. When he fells that he is going to get it, he starts ""dancing"".I cannot say anything about its function, my dog only got stix few times. But he likes them even though they have a terrible smell. I would buy again."
My kids love this game-esp my 5 yr old-She derives such pride out of doing it all by herself-and its nicethat she can sit for a good amount of time and play unassisted:)
"MY SON LOVES THIS TOY,MY HUSBAND AND HIM SIT FOR HOURS AND PLAY.MY HUSBAND SAYS HE WISHES THAY HAD THIS WHEN HE WAS LITTLE."
I needed this for an adult game but it is very small tiny. It does come with instructions and in a big tin with a jack and ball set. All of the products are small and tiny. They seem to swim in the tin that is way too big for these items. It does come with instructions. Overall I recommend a larger more durable set.
"My son loves his phone. We are constantly ""calling"" each other and singing. My only complaint is the short phone cord. If he wants to pick it up, he has to be really close to the phone base or he drags it around. The songs on it are really cute and the ""voice"" is very clear and easily understood!"
Instantly left my hair feeling soft and supple. I really liked the texture of my hair after using the product. I've only used it a few times so I'll expand my review when the bottle's contents have been used.
Lathers well. Used on Shar-Pei that appeared to have a grass allergy. No further problems with skin. Will make this a regular part of her grooming.
"I had to write a review following giving this to my 4 year old son for Christmas. This is by far the best gift my boy has ever received. Not only does he play with it every day, but he and his father love building and rebuilding different designs together. I can honestly say that giving this was the best part of my Christmas. Well worth driving several hours through a snowstorm to get."
Although the quality and shipping and everything was great and timely. My cats just didn't like this at all. It gunked up the fountain and they didn't eat it or bother to even mess with it so we just threw it away. It's a good product if your cats get use out of it.
"I have this toy in a few sizes and colors. It's not my dog's favorite toy but when I smear a teaspoon of peanut butter or cream cheese in it, he loves it to pieces.He is a very aggressive chewer and the Kongs hold up to his King Kong jaws but I don't think he's a big hard rubber fan. He likes soft things that squeak when bitten...like my toes. ;) Still, the Kong is a good distraction while the humans eat dinner or when he has to sit in his crate or in the car.I definitely recommend stuffing it with something to hold the appeal for finicky pups."
I ordered this for my mom for mother's day. I liked the price & she loves the scent. Thank you.
"I started wearing this about two years ago. Let me start by saying that I HATE most floral perfumes. Some floral perfumes even leave me feeling woozy and nauseus. I usually wear scents that are warm, spicy, and sexy. Light and floral is usually not something I find interesting.This perfume is completely different. According to one website, it is ""A distinctive blend of rare gingerlily with citrus, rich florals, sandalwood, musk and blackcurrant"".All I know is that I have never smelled someone else wearing it and it is an absolutely lovely scent. Every time I wear it someone asks me about the cologne I'm wearing. Hubby is also a fan.The scent is classic but not the type of classic that makes you smell like your grandmother's dressing table."
"I got this game for my birthday, and i have to give it an over all score of 4 stars. You see, the title basically describes the game, you create your dream life. You design your girl and her best friend, and your room. Then you can explore the town. You have to go school every day and study for tests and do homework. The better you do in school, the cooler things your parents let you buy. There's the rec center were you can sign up for activies. And then there's the mall! There you can buy shoes, clothes, and things for your room.I'll tell you, this game defantly has it's ups and downs. It's good things are that it teaches you how to save money, for the more you have, the cooler things you can buy. It also teaches you responsiblity, for to earn money you have to work (all though work in this game is just pushing a button). You also need to manage time, so that you can fit in studying, talking and shopping.But, this game deffantly had some downs. You see, this game can get boring after a while, for you're always doing the same thing. Also, really, there isn't much to do. Really, the only thing you can do is shop. Sure that is really fun, but it's always the same clothes. You never get to see anything new.This game is great for the preteen in the family."
"Love this stuff so much that I have it on auto order! Cannot find it in any store although Walmart used to have it in`a different fragrance. This product virtually eliminates the need for a lubricating lotion except on areas with relatively thick skin like heels and elbows. Smells nice but can clash with fragrances. Great for dry skin due to hot showering! Highly recommend it! Absorbs within 15 minutes w/o greasy feel, just a nice satiny smooth skin."
AGE IS LISTED FOR 3 AND UP SO WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD THAT WOMAN GET THIS FOR A LITTLE BABY! THIS IS A WONDERFUL TOY FOR THE RIGHT AGE. NOT A BABY!
We bought this to treat our chickens mites. Worked very well. Be sure to follow up with a retreatment 10 days later.
"I love this shampoo. I invested in some Nioxin after lots of people suggested it, and I couldn't tell much of a difference, but I always figure buying shampoos to make a huge difference on your hair was a bit of a crapshoot anyway, so I didn't hold it against Nioxin. But then on a whim I bought some of this at the grocery store last month, and I swear I can tell a difference. I lost a lot of hair due to poor diet and high stress (paired with significant weight loss) at the end of the summer, and for the first part of the fall I was so insecure and self conscious about my hair. I've tried to keep up with some vitamins and have been eating a lot better, so I'm sure that plays a part in the change in my hair, but I swear this shampoo has also made a difference when no other shampoo ever has before. My hair is babyfine and flat and losing ANY of it was frustrating. It really does feel thicker now."
"This stuff is great. It smells nice (lavender scent) and it works really well. I usually put it on my hands before I go to bed, and I put it on my nails after I remove nail polish (since nail polish remover is drying). The one drawback is that it's a bit on the oily side (it doesn't sink in right away) and that's why I use it prior to going to bed. Probably one of the best products by Burt's Bees, and one tin lasts for a really long time."
"This is a tale of one dog and two cats... The dog (a Corgi) was the devil essentially. We got her as a puppy a year ago, and thought that she would learn to play nice with our cats that are 14 and 3 years old. As time went by, things got progressively worse, to the point where the cats were always locked in the computer room for their own protection. It got to the point where something had to give; we were contemplating giving up our dog. As a last resort I brought this home on March 24, 2009. We put it one her that night and four zaps later, her and the 14 year old were sitting quietly together on the living room floor and the door hasn't been shut since! Today is April 5; it hasn't even been two weeks since we started her on this training.Definitely worth the money, but I suggest you by it here as you will pay approximately $60-70 more at PetCo or PetSmart (which is what I did).Only complaint is that the batteries run out pretty fast and you have to push down really hard on the shock button to have it transmit. Either way, it is still worth the money as my dog can now stay. And my cats can now be a part of the family again."
Our Golden Retriever really loves these. Don't give them to him often and use them for a special treat.
"pretty much nothing like this on the market! it's a great product but this one was WAY too large for our needs. we ended up buying the middle-sized one which is perfect for our two small dogs. this large one would be good for multiple larger dogs. we would have kept it and made room for it, but because of its size we would have wasted wee-wee pad since it would take several days for it to get filled and by then it stinks too much!"
"Worked fast and well. Not sure if it will make my hair fall out yet as I have just used it today. No burning, easy directions, overall good coverage and color. I will still have to use some toner to get to platinum(Take the yellow out). Trying punky color toner in a few days. Wish me luck!"
"I got this farm for my son for his first birthday. He really likes all the sounds, especially the little tune that plays when you push the rooster to the side. He also has started playing with the animals now and he especially likes to put the animals and farmer all in the silo! The sounds on it stopped working after about a month. My son didn't throw it on the floor or anything so I couldn't figure out why the sounds stopped working (and really even if he did throw it on the floor--they should make toys made for 1-4 year olds more durable!). We changed the batteries but they still wouldn't work. My son still played with the farm but he was disappointed that the sounds wouldn't work. Well I contacted customer service thinking maybe I could get another part for the sounds but they sent us a BRAND NEW FARM!! Wow!!! Awesome customer service! We got the new farm today and my son played with it for a long time. He LOVES the sounds!"
"I've been using this for over 12 years, ever since it first came out. It changed my life b/c I have Seb Dermititus and occasional acne and this product did an excellent job with my skin. I even use it as handwash b/c it doesn't over dry my skin. You cannot beat the bundle price on Amazon. It beats any price locally and w/o tax and free 2-day shipping for Prime members. What a bargain for a fantastic product."
"Super cute. My son likes it. Can't say it keeps him busy for a long time....but nothing does right now. it's got enough on it that its entertaining though.I think its pretty cool, especially since it also speaks Spanish. My husband is Argentinian and I like to find toys that help our son with his Spanish words."
"This is the only board/card game that I've extensively play and still like. I gave away the set that I had, but I'd buy it again, if I could find enough people to play the darn thing.I won't bore you with details such as the rules of the game or why I like it, but I would like to mention that there should be more board games that cater to those needing entertainment. It seems that most are created as intellectual endeavors (not why I play games) or mindless pastimes (usually not why I play games). The most interesting kind of games, of which Bang! is a good example, is social games. The kind that you can use to make new friends or get more out of your old ones (until you trade them in for store credit).Yeah it's terribly educational. When I lost the English version of the rules, I had to learn Italian just to be able to play the game again.It's about as durable as you'd expect something made of paper to be."
"This device worked when NOTHING else did. It works on both of our Pomeranians. They were constant barkers. They're smart dogs and still bark when then collar is off, but never make a peep when it's on! Sometimes just showing them the collar works!One of our Poms took a while to learn...maybe 3 weeks. The other learned after just 2 barks.Don't waste your money on the cruel electric collars (that don't even stop the dog from barking, anyway). Buy this collar and you'll thank yourself for years to come."
"I have three foster cats and have a smaller version of this pan along with a booda dome. I've found though that only the smallest of the cats would use the dome, so all three were really using the small box. With the purchase of this, I've given away the dome and everyone's now using each box equally. What I like about this one though is that the sides and opening are very high and I get much less litter on the floor than I do with the smaller box. I'd highly recommend this product.Note"
I started using this product about 6 months ago after taking off acrylic nails. It works great!! My nails have never been so strong in my life. The main reason I had acrylics in the first place was because my real nails were so weak. Not anymore!! I would highly recommend it to anyone.
"Our relatives got one of these beds for our dogs as a gift. We have 2 large dogs (~80lbs each and similar in shape to large goldens). Having never had a bed before it took them a little while to try it out, but once they did they loved it!! They will actually race back to the bed at night to determine who gets to sleep in it and if one gets up the other races over to take their place. We're definitely going to get a second one!"
Apparently this is the improved version over the Intruder. It flies nicely and is a lot of fun. Be sure to give yourself a nice open field as you may crash into trees on your first few runs. The two minute flying time goes by in a flash as it is lots of fun to fly. Kids (10&7) really liked it too.
"If you like murder mystery games, this one goes far beyond Clue. Be the first to get the correct answers to score the most points. This is a great game for a group of people or for just three. It is similar to Clue in concept but without the board. It is also more involved because you try to discover more information (such as time of day, location, murderer, motive, etc.) Even when it is not your turn, you can pick up information from noticing not only other players questions and answers, but which players are asking and answering. As in Clue, one person announces when they decide they have figured everything out. But, in Alibi, everyone then makes their best guesses and everyone may earn some points. It can be an addictive game and I have yet to find someone who has played that did not like it. It is small enough to be easily carried and interesting enough for any group of people. Also, it can be adapted to different types of players. Use a simpler version with children and a more complicated version with more sophisticated players. If you like games, this would be an excellent addition to your collection."
"I'm really surprised a previous reviewer said it doesn't tip over. My 9 mo old daughter can tip it over easily when she tries to pull up on it. In fact, my husband or I have to sit on the other side of it and hold it so it doesn't tip. The ""table"" part is heavy and if it hits my daughter, it wouldn't be pretty.Just look at the legs- they go straight down whereas the leap frog table's legs bulge out for more balance and stability. That's my big complaint- otherwise it's fun and colorful."
"This is an ok unit - we mainly got it for vacation feeding, but then we realized it would be best to keep our cat on a regular feeding schedule and have been using it everyday. The bad thing is even on the lowest setting (1/4) it is dispensing between 1/2 - 3/4 cup of food, so it is very inaccurate. I have somewhat corrected this by blocking part of the opening... The other negative is that is runs on battery - no option for wall plug."
"yea i got Commander Cody along with 5 other Utapau troopers and 3 paratroopers, looks pretty good seeing them line up together. Great figure for any fan,even if they're new to star wars too!!!"
This collar seems very well made. The clasp and the loop are sturdy. The purple color is very pretty and accurately reflected in the photo.
"Our first baby wasn't a huge fan, but our 8 month old has just gotten into this toy. Keeps her attention for several minutes, and she enjoys shaking it as a maraca while we sing together."
"I remember using something like these back in the 1970's (I even had one on the end of a hose that would squirt water. You would use that one after a shampoo and not during) and I remember liking them, so when I came across it on Amazon, I had to order one. Problem is, this one is made of hard plastic and using it feels like scraping my head with a comb. The little spikes could stand to be a bit more pliable and a little less abrasive on the scalp. I'm still enjoying it, and I use it every time I wash my hair--albeit very lightly. It really massages the scalp, but when I rinse afterwards I get a bit of a burn where the water hits all the little scratches in my scalp."
"We got this for our 20 month old son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. He carries it around and sings the ""Toot Toot Chugga Chugga Big Red Car"" all the time. It's been durable so far, so if your kids like the Wiggles, it is a definite must have."
"I have a lab mix who has some serious separation anxiety. Whenever I leave, she feels compelled to bark until I get home. The battery voltage is strong enough to stop her barking though she will still whimper because she has learned exactly how loud she can whimper before she gets shocked. Overall, I am satisfied."
"Listen, adult fans of Skywarp, this toy isn't just for you. I'm a kid, my brother (the true owner) is a kid too. I'm absent from school today and thought I'd kill some time by praising this incredible toy. From the reviews of Skywarp or Thundercracker, Skywarps wings don't hug the body tightly, this is true, but who cares? If you do, sorry about that. One useless detail about G1 is that the characters on the show and the toy can be very different. But I guess you must make some sacrifices.Back to the wings, The wings look like right triangles with an edge cut off and O.75 in stub added. To be quite honest they make him look fat, but you can slide his wings back to make them LOOK thinner. Also, Skywie's head is a little small and with this 1.25 in cone sticking out of the back of his head. If that cone was orange, he'd be perfect for a protectobot, shooing the traffic away from a disaster. Anyway, Skywarp's arms are a little thin, but the fists and blasters make up for it. Speaking of his fists, you have to pocket them in vehicle mode.Okay I've made Skywarp sound like a bad toy, ignore the entire first part and read THIS:Listen, adult fans of Skywarp, this toy isn't just for you. I'm a kid, my brother (the true owner) is a kid too. I'm absent from school today and thought I'd kill some MORE time by praising this incredible toy. The missle launchers are incredible. Huge, but incredible. WAIT ""Huge, but incredible,"" isn't a complete sentence. Okay let me try it again"
This product has been working for me....but it does cause minor breakouts on my face.......it works great on the neck area.....
"I am not a person who would make a big deal over lotion but this lotion is impressive. A bottle of this was sitting in the breakroom at work and so I put some on and instantly knew I had to have some of my own. It is not greasy, smells refreshing and it is actually soothing. You have got to try this!!!"
"Information given was complete. I would have liked an immediate confirmation/email to be sure that my order went through. It was the manufacturer, brand, strength and count that I was looking for. I am very happy and feel that I got a good price."
"This is a great pinball game! It's loads of fun. My son and I played it at a local movie theater recently. We both had a blast! It was an exciting combination of sights and sounds that held both of our interests. If only we could afford to buy this, we would in a second. :)"
This is ia very nice musical toy. It has a very pretty sound. The book that comes with it has familiar songs for my child to learn to play. The songs are easy to learn to play. I like playing it as much as my kids!
"Since my cat was suffering from hairballs and the hairball remedies weren't doing the trick, my vet suggested the FURminator. They also recommended the smaller one since it would do the job just as well as the larger ones available. It pulled the hair out easily and without a lot of trauma for the cats. I'm pleased with the purchase."
"This scene from the beloved Harry Potter books is a MUST have for any Harry Potter fan. Even though it has a high price, I believe that it will be worth more in the years to come. So if you would like to have the beloved giant,Hagrid and Norbert sitting somehwere in your house, then just order this great item!"
"I BOUGHT THIS FOR $10 AT WALMART. WORKS GREAT UP TO 42"". I REALLY WANT ONE FOR MY 52 INCH KITCHEN WALKWAY BUT AM DISSIAPOINTED I CANT FIND ONE THAT'S PRESSURE MOUNTED. I DON'T WANT TO DRILL A BUNCH OF HOLES INTO MY WALLS! SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE 'EM LONGER!!"
"I have received more compliments on this hair color than any other time I have dyed my hair. I will say at first the color is very bold and gorgeous but in a few days it settles into a very natural light red (like people who are actually redheads). The second time I used it the color lasted longer, more like two weeks of a vibrant but natural looking red and then a gradual fade to a neutral red. I have naturally medium blonde hair. I wanted a more vibrant red, but it is really a very gorgeous color. I was reluctant to use it since I couldn't find any reviews on this color anywhere, but I'm glad I did. Seriously the compliments never end ;) I'm about to dye it for the third time hoping it will be even darker this time! Like most people say, the color does not look like it does on the box. For me this color is lighter than it is on the box and even lighter than what it shows on the back of the box :/ Really wish it was darker...will probably look great on dark blonde to brown hair."
I have been useing the bigger version of this for more than a year now with my two dogs.. a t year old coonhound and a 4 year old border collie / aussie mix.. they love it and its very durable.. but.. they dont chew it or even give it a second look after the kibble is gone...lol
"I bought these clippers after my trusty 20+ year old German-made clippers finally succumbed to metal fatigue, and the cheap China-made replacements I initially bought just didn't cut it (pun intended). I never really thought I'd ever pay 15 bucks for a pair of clippers, but these are heavy, seem very sturdy, and cut both smoothly and cleanly. I expect these clippers to last for several years, but even if they only last a few years, they'll still have been a better investment than the crummy five-dollar clippers I'll never use again!"
We just bought our third Flexi Leash for our Labrador Retriever. She exercised them from full extension forward to full extension back for around 45 minutes every day for the past 5+ years. They don't last forever. The spring broke in each of the previous ones. I guess 2.5 years is not bad for tightly wound spring steel. The truth is that I am hooked on the ability to let her do her thing on our walks without actually having her be off-leash.
"What an ingenious item. Easy to carry, my dog likes it, saves water, etc. Lots of other options out there, but none that are as cleverly designed. I may buy a second as a back up!"
My son loves this toy. He is really into the sounds it makes and especially the light. He has lots of fun playing with this toy. I recommmed this flashlight to any child that is into lights and trains. Its a great buy.
I purchased this as a birthday gift for my husband and he hasn't stopped playing with it! The UV nib really doesn't work but it's still a lot of fun!
"This collar does what it says but it took a while for us to get results. At first we could figure out why it wasn't shocking when she barked but when we tried making it tighter we saw results. You can tell right away when it shocks. Our dog caught on pretty fast. She only had to get shocked three times and now doesn't even try it. She hardly wears it now because if she starts to bark too much now I yell the command ""no bark!"" and hold up the collar and she stops. I don't even need to put it on her. I recommend having a command to say when they get shocked that you can say later on so they recognize that they need to stop barking."
"I bought the entire set of incredibles action figures for my four year old son and was very disappointed. The invisible violet arrived broken, and the regular violet broke within days. The joints are not secure and will break easily. ---I would however reccommend the Dash, Syndrome, and Mr. Incredible, we've had them for over a year with no problems. Don't buy this Violet or the Mom."
"Rasta Mango & Lime Locking Gel is Fantastic. I am constantly recieving comments on my Lovely Locs, thanks to this product. My hair is manageable, soft, moisturized (not sticky or greasy) ... I love this product. Use the Locking Gel along with the moisturizing spray, shampoo and conditioner for Lovely Locs, all the time."
"This oil smells lovely but it can be difficult if you use it in colder weather - in my bathroom it hardened even with the heat on. I had to thaw it in the shower, which took quite some time. I suspect this will be something I use during the summer only."
My french bulldog is 4 months old and wears a small size. She loves it and it keeps her warm! Very good quality!
Easy to grow edible grass for cats. My cat loves eating house plants. She prefers this over houseplants that we wanted her to stay out of.
I got this for my 8 month old daughter and she loves it. My 3 year old loves to push it for her and chase the balls that fly out. Great toy for both!
What a nightmare!!!! First we spend $70 on a remote control toy only to find that it requires a special battery chsrger that's sold separately! We learned this on Christmas Day while our disappointed 9 year old spends much of his Christmas complaining that he can't use the toy he so desired. We trek back to Toys R Us the day after Christmas and were sold the wrong Tyco Flexpak charger. So we arrive home to disappoint our son once again. So now we have to order the remote control on line. I guess our son will be in college before he gets to try this toy and have an opinion about it.
"I am rather impressed with this toy. I have purchased a number of other ""toy props"" in the past. I have a few phasers, a Klingon knife, a tricorder, and a couple of communicators, but this phaser/communicator combo from Art Asylum is really very nice. The sculpting is adequate on both items, but what makes these special is the use of light. The communicator is a simple device with a sound chip, but the lighted screen is a nice touch. The classic communicator with the recorder in it was nicely done, and is better than this communicator by far, but still, this is a nice rendition. The phaser has a light at the end when you pull the trigger, as expected, but it was a pleasant surprise to plug in the toy power cell and have it light up! That was really nice. I don't like the orange tip on the gun, but that can't be helped. I'm going to paint mine. I like the fact that the instruction booklet mentions the orange tip, and comments that it isn't ""Starfleet issue"". Overall, this is a very nice toy for [the money]."
"The seller sent the cat stockings right away. I bought three of them. They ended up being different colors from what was pictured, but the cat absolutely loves them. It's hilarious to listen to the bell clanging around. I know that sound means the cat is tossing it around. The last one we had was the cat's favorite toy and overdue for replacement."
"I didn't know the fragance of this perfume but my girlfriend wanted it. She was so happy with the gift, and I learned it smells really nice."
"Before I purchased this item, I saw one in the store that had its wing broken off at the ball joint. I was a little concerned about how it would hold up for my 3-year-old, but thought it probably broke because some kid was a little over zealous at the store. Not so. My son didn't have this toy out of the package more than an hour, when I found it on the floor with one wing out of it's socket, and the other one broken at the ball joint. I'm going to exchange it, but if it happens again, he'll have a one-winged dragon, and he'll be making up creative stories about how it came to be so mamed."
"Nice fountain, but... very strange though - their packing QA must be a little bad. For some reason my box included a partially filled package from the Drinkwell Aqua Garden kit. It had the seed basket clip and the instructions, but no seeds or basket. Other than that, it works as advertised. Highly recommended for cats and small dogs - it truly encourages them to drink more."
"This is a nice Spiderman figure. Even though he looks too skinny and the webbing on his costume looks too close together when compared to other ToyBiz Spiderman figures, it has other redeeming qualities. This figure has decent--and more useful--articulation than most figures. Head, neck, shoulders, arms, elbows, mid forearms, waist, hips, knees, mid-shin, and ankles all bend and/or rotate. It has an interchangeable head so that you can pose him with a Peter Parker head so it seems as if he has taken off his mask for a little fresh air. He has two fists instead of the overused ""web shooting"" pose. Personally, I think this is wonderful. Spidey can finally trade punches with the bad guys instead of spin webs all the time. Also, the joint at the waist only turns far enough to the left or the right to allow the spring action inside to work and make it look like Spidey is throwing a punch. Again, I think this is great. All the other Spiderman action figures we have bought have this joint and it turns the figure all the way around 360 degrees. No one can do that in real life. Not to mention that it is also the first joint that gets loose and his body will twist and turn around even when you don't want him to. The accessory is OK. The Shocker can be ""trapped"" to the wall that he is permanently attached to by ""punching"" him. The webbing that traps him doesn't always wrap around the Shocker every time it is activated. Only the Shocker's head moves, unfortunately. It would have been real nice to have him as a separate action figure, though. Or, they could have made it a 2-in-1 action figure pack. A good product for kids."
I have used this product for five days and my skin is severely red and irritated. It provoked further breakouts and the areas that aren't broken out are red. Don't buy!!!!
This is the perfect gift! My grandson loves to build potato heads and Spiderman! this is perfect for him! Thanks for coming up with this stuff!
I saw that amazon had gave this a 5 star test and no way is it worth buying. It never changed the odor in my kids bedroom floor.
"Fast shipping. The straightener works very good, even with my difficult hair. Would recommend to everyone!"
I have used this product for years - my fifth Saint currently has this twice a day on his dry food. Keeps his coat looking shiny and his skin in excellent condition.
"My sister in law absolutely loved it! The products were very nice presented in a lovely box, perfect if you are looking for a nice present."
This product does what it says it will do. I think the product probably works best for people with min to mod hair loss. You can see the product on your scalp in the right lighting close up. The product will rub off in your hands so you should use hair spray to help hold it in place. I have balding in front and crown. I'm a 43 year old male. Matching the right hair color is essential. I use a combination of med brown and light brown. I found it helped even the color out best for me. I no it isn't that detectable because I work with very honest people and if they had detected it they would have commented. One person I work with noticed something different and commented my hair looked thicker but he couldn't detect the product. I can tell it's there I guess because I know it is and to me the product just covers your scalp. Thats why I think it works best for people with min to mod hair loss. This product would be very apparent if you have hardly no hair. It is fairly easy to use and you do have to clean up the bathroom counter top after application. I also have to wipe and shape up my forehead after application. I bought the spray applicator and it does help for the front of the hair line.
"This product does work; however the instructions state the entire training process will only take 5 weeks. That is a bit to fast for most cats. I spent about four month going very slow each time I removed a ring. At the same time, I purchased a battery powered automatic toilet flusher. It all works like a charm!!!! The key is to be patient."
"I absolutely LOVE the original True Star! So I had to have a sample of the True Star Gold as soon as I found out about it! I've been wearing it for the past few days and I like this scent also. Just not as much as True Star. I was in love the scent of True Star Gold a few years ago...when it was called Tropical Punch by Escada. Yup, that's my verdict. It smells exactly like Escada's Tropical Punch. Really nice n' fresh n' VIBRANT. Like a fruitier version of True Star."
"I love these towelettes! I am light skinned (but not pale) and have eczema on my arms that make them red. When I use this product it makes my skin tone look more even (as well as giving me a little color) and my eczema is not as noticeable. I followed another reviewers advice and made sure I shaved the day before using, and showered the day of, but let my skin dry for at least 15 minutes afterwards before applying the towelette to it. I also applied it in circular motions as not to cause a streaky look. Works great!"
"I'm not a fan of automated or battery operated games, but I have to admit this one is worth every penny. My son immediately fell in love with it. It's good educational fun, which keeps your child challenged."
"This game made us all laugh, and that's not easy to do at our house! From teenagers to senior citizens, this game is a winner."
"When you want to feel absolutely beautiful...This is the parfum to wear...Jennifer Lopez has one of the best parfum on the market in my opinion. I am always complemented on my look and my style and I wear Still when I want to be my beautiful best! Buy it, you will love it too!"
I specifically looked for this product online because I couldn't find it in the local drugstore any longer. This really does what it says it does - it gives you a matte finish which lasts pretty much all day - you will notice a difference when you use it and when you don't. If you tend to get oily skin during the day (T-zone or otherwise) this minimizes that significantly. I hope I can always find this product!
"Great game for kids and adults. Requires quite a bit of concentration, but is challenging and fun. This word count for reviews is nuts!"
"RACKO is a game for 2 to 4 people. The object of the game is to go ""RACKO"" - having all 10 cards in your rack in consecutive order. You accomplish this by drawing and discarding cards on your turn. When somebody goes ""RACKO"" everybody counts how many points they have. You get 5 points for each card you have in your rack that goes in order from low to high starting from the bottom, and whoever goes ""RACKO"" gets an additional 25 points. If the person who goes ""RACKO"" has any runs of 3 or more cards, they get additional bonus points. First person to 500 points wins.RACKO is very fun, and involves a lot of strategy. The rules are simple enough that kids can enjoy the game as well, making RACKO a fun game for the entire family."
"I had seen this cat litter at a kiosk at the Pet Expo in Del Mar, CA and had noticed how wonderful it smells. The litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. The sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the Florida company that produces Feline Pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the South.I tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. It is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. Any ""dust"" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.As the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. I suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. The sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily ""stirring"", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.The only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don't dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. The bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but I think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. The packaging also says ""CHEMICAL FREE..."" which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. H2O (water) is a chemical. It should read ""HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL FREE"" or ""BIOTOXIN FREE"".Anyway, I'll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. Now that I've tried a premium litter, I'll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best."
"This stuff smells great...they stopped making it for a while but I just found it in the travel sizes at Wal Mart...for 97 cents. This price is way too high,,,and the shipping?? Give me a break!!"
"I bought it for my daughter in Jan. 2010. The remote did not work well. When you pushed the player button, it only played around 1 mintue song and stoped."
I bought this game (for $50) to use as a classroom tool and play with my drama classes. I found the game frustrating and boring for my students and even though it was recommended by a book I did not find it useful. I wish I hadn't spent the money!
I just purchased the 30 qt & 60 qt containers for dog & cat food. The best thing I have purchased in a long time. The 30 qt. holds 20-25 lbs. of cat food with no problem. The 60 qt is for the dog food. Very good price & Amazon is super on shipping
"I had this game when I was younger, so I bought it for my 10 year old daughter who loves games. She loves it! My other daughters play it as well, and the youngest is 5 and plays it easily. They have so much fun playing the game that they really don't mind who wins, which is rare with my competitive ones."
"I didn't care for it, it was too light and the smell didn't last too long. I prefer a strong flowery smelling perfume"
"This is not a bad product overall; however, describing it as large is very misleading. It is tiny; maybe ok for a dog under 16 lbs but that's it. As the result, we could only use it for 2 weeks before our puppy grew out of it. Also, the handle is attached loosely and comes off easily which makes it hard to carry."
"My 5 and 2 year old boys really have enjoyed this game, probably mostly because they enjoy Pooh. There really isn't a whole lot of educational value, except the color matching is good for developing visual acuity. Also the second part of the game does offer a chance for younger children to complete a simple puzzle.The cardboard spinner and pieces don't hold up well, especially when little ones chew on them! All that being said, my kids really have played with it alot, so I guess it was worth the money. At the current Amazon price, you really can't go wrong."
"Cute game, but it is much smaller than I expected it to be- not much bigger than a set of Uno cards. Haven't played it yet so can't review how fun it is or whether the kids liked it. Just wish it had been a little bigger."
"I have hair that just doesn't like to do what I want it to most of the time. This product helps me gain the upper hand. Along with a root lifter I use this product to get structure and lift from my blow out. I like it best when I'm going for a tousled look, but it works well in adding body to other styles."
"I am now a former Aveda shampoo user after my husband bought Bumble and Bumble Creme de Coco Shampoo. This shampoo lathers far more than Aveda products and you don't need to use as much shampoo, so it lasts a long time. My hair feels softer and cleaner with this product. The conditioner is great as well"
"I rated this toy so poorly all because the plane is impossible to fly.Although Im no plane enthusiast,I at least know it should work!the car is ok but is bad on anything but smooth surfaces.tThe turbo is a nice feature, but it dosen't help this thing."
This toy travels well. I keep it in the car for my daughter to play with and she loves it. It's a great size for a lap toy and yet is soft to the touch.
"I tried this product in a store once and loved it. When I saw the incredible price here, I immediately ordered one. I still adore the scent of this perfume however it does not last more than a hour or so. I have to carry the bottle with me whenever I go out and it is getting frustrating!! So think twice before you buy and save your money."
"My daughters, Scooby-Doo fans both (age 6,) wanted this for Christmas. I found it on sale so snapped it up, intrigued by the 3D design. It's very cute. A little tricky to figure out how to assemble at first. The pictures are tiny and the diagram letters don't match up with the piece numbers. But I'm usually good at that kind of thing so I figured it out. But then I couldn't get the cage to stay up, not realizing that it would once I pushed the ghost down to ""set"" the game. Make sure if you push the ghost down, you hear it click, or the traps won't work. I'd love to know how this thing works on the inside, because several, but not all at the same time, traps spring each time, and the fun is not knowing which pieces will be casualties. The girls thought it was hilarious. We played it over and over. They loved the suspense of who would get attacked by a trap, and they thought it was hilarious that my piece always fell off the stairs, and one of them got flung out the back window/door! That was a surprise.We had a lot of fun playing it. They even used it to play Scooby-Doo as a playhouse with the pieces (all characters from the show). However, the more characters played, the more of a logjam on the game. Especially when multiple characters had issues with the same trap. Characters can't occupy more than one to a space. This is important for certain traps to work. The round base of the pawns fit exactly on the round circle/spaces to properly position the pieces for the traps.The game also has to be partially disassembled in order to fit back in the box. This is a little tedious. Hopefully the back cardboard wall pieces hold up from repeated disassembly/reassembly.Overall, cute concept, fun when it works properly. Make sure the ghost clicks to spring the traps! It's very noisy when the game works. Almost sounds like the grinding roar of some of the creepy characters of the game."
"This product is nice! it smells just like chocolate!! only problem is it does NOT last long at all, that is a bit disappointing."
"Would not go a day without! Love, love, love! I've been using for 40 years - highly recommend!"
"This deck is so good!!! So many good cards in one deck!!!It includes very good cards such as Magic Jammer, Relinquished, Toon World, and Robin Goblin. All and all I suggest you get this deck."
"I have color-treated hair. This conditioner is the best I've ever used! My styling brushes glide through my hair, while blowdryer. No tangles, tugging or pulling! I like the like scent of it -- not too overpowering. Just enough to complement my other scent layers of Philosophy's grace series. I highly recommend!"
I like the look and feel of the toys. Very cute! I don't know yet how my Granddaughter likes them being she is only 4 weeks old.I'm sure she will like them.
I have used more self tanners that I can count. This is by far the best. It is just the right shade so it doesn't leave obvious streaking while providing a very natural shade for me. love it!
Our 6 month old weimapeake(weimanerer/Chesapeake Bay Retriever) loves the Kong football. She has had it for over 2 months- other than being dirty it still squeaks and is 100% intact. We have trained her to the squeak which is almost like a whistle- she can be anywhere in the house or puppy park and with a squeak she will be at our sides immediately. I have ordered more as a reserve because we can no longer find them in pet stores. One pet store told us they were no longer being made- not sure if that is true or a ploy get us to buy something else. Thanks to the internet I have found more and now have a reserve as well as the larger size as she grows. WE LOVE KONG PRODUCTS QUALITY.
"I started using Mederma immediately after my double knee replacement last November. It has almost completey hidden the right scar & the left is coming along also. This product is great, but must be used at least twice a day for best results"
"My girlfriend, her daughter, and I love this game. Pretty simple to learn. Match the cards and go find your prey. Simple but those darn Grizzlies are hard to catch. The board is full of different (15 in all) animals. My one complaint is the way in which the animals are presented. They should be color cordinated. We get confused at times on which is a trout or salmon etc etc. Also, how do you stop a grizzly with a bow and arrow. Overall, the game is good fun for the whole family, it gets the competitive juices flowing."
Fashion Pet Puddles Rain Medium Dog PonchoPerfect as all others too small - maybe a little trimming needed - the drawstring at chin for hood is a plus as I am only a tiny 5# dog and it will cover my ears and stay in place - If too long on back just hitch up like a pleat when securing strap across belly ...Ordered the small as XS are too small and with this size we can trim away [with pinking shears] if needed all around the outside edge.Just have to wait for snow and winds to go away before I can stroll and strut my stuff outdoors to show the neighbors.
both of my daughters get huge welts from mosquito bites. this product reduces the size of the bites AND stops the itching. i have little jars of it everywhere.
"This would be a great product for kitty litter if it were made of metal. Unfortunately, it is made of plastic & is too flimsy to pick up heavy litter clumps created by cat litter. If you are looking for a good kitty litter scoop, look elsewhere."
"On my skin Bijan with a Twist smells like bergamot/orange, a touch of some spice, amber, vanilla, maybe grapefruit & lavender? This isn't overtly strong and it changes very subtlety playing all the notes throughout the day. The ending act is a powdery bergamot spice. Quite nice.The lasting power is incredible. Two sprays lasted for well over 8 hours on my skin.I wouldn't repurchase after I run out, as I have so many I wear more often. Tho, I do really like this. Worth a try."
"My son got attached to this little doggie since a very young age--only a few months old. He has a million other toys, but this is clearly his favorite. He hugs it when he goes to sleep...he ""tackles"" it when he plays, rolling around hugging it, smiling. I am glad to hear in the other review that it will hold up when washed; I just purchased another one as a ""back up,"" just in case! It really needs to be washed! It's not supposed to be (""surface wash only"") which is why I don't give it a higher durability rating."
Got this for my son a few years ago...it is a standard favorite for all ages. Easy to keep in a purse or bag and pull out to keep anyone quietly engaged. I have recommended it over and over again.
My fiance is very picky and after careful deliberation I selected this scent for him in a store. I loved it and I was so relieved that he loved it too! The scent is manly but unique and soft/subtle unless you spray a lot. Now that I've found it on amazon I can make sure he never runs out!
"This ""guitar"" is simply a noise maker. There is no volume control. There is no off button. There are no strings. All kids have to do is hit one of four buttons to start loud, annoying music. It is unreliable. Sometimes the buttons start the music, sometimes they don't. Do not buy this toy."
My daughter loves reading these riddles/mysteries and trying to solve them. Then she loves testing them on me.
"This collar has worked well so far. My cat is an escape artist when it comes to collars but she hasn't lost this one yet. She has scratched it a bit so it is looking a little ragged, but they warn you about that and give you instructions on how to prevent it. I just chose not to worry about it.Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase."
"Very easy to apply, lasts more than two months.Sometime, it drops and you may stain your bathroom wall."
"And if you got this as a gift, realize that person probably hates you.I got this as an impulse buy at a retail pet store and finally got around to installing it today. Or should I say ""attempting"" to install it. As most of the reviews state, this product is deeply flawed. This design is sold under more than one company name, so watch out. Literally nothing fits the way it should. Yes I do mean ""literally"". The picture only instructions are ambiguous or just plain wrong and there are no written instructions. Oh, and if you make it to the end, where the instructions show a picture of a hacksaw shortening the screws to allow the end caps to fit, it won't work. The screws need to be slightly shorter than the opening, not flush with it the way the will be when you are done. It would have been nice to know that before I spent 20 sweaty minutes sawing through metal.Trying to install this thing was an exercise in frustration. I spent 2 hours trying to make this work and have given up. The stress this thing caused me probably took a year off my life. I haven't been this mad in a long time. I now have a circular hole in my door and I only hope I can find a slightly larger pet door to install or I will have to replace my door.What have I learned from this experience? Make sure everything will fit together BEFORE you cut a hole in your door."
"It is nice that the cover comes off so you can throw it in the wash. This size does seem a little large for my cats (1 is 8.5 lbs the other is 12 lbs.) I think they prefer places that have a little more hiding involves and places to cuddle up a little tighter. It was worth the price, though."
"I ordered this for a litter of chihuahua puppies. I placed a square of linoleum under and it worked great.It was easy to put together and is easy to take apart. There was plenty of room for a potty, sleep, and play area."
My dog is visibly healthier while taking this product 1 morning and evening. She had a limp that was diagnosed by a vet as arthritis setting in related to a prior injury. Since she has been using this product her shoulder soreness only flares up when she gets overly agressive wiht the squirrels in the back yard.
"I thought that the game was very amusing!! Veyr inventive idea and game that everyone can participate in. I really like the colours that they used, very bright and happy."
"I purchased this house for my two outside cats. I have to say the pictures looked like there were shingles on the roof, but it is wood just like the rest of the structure -- seems to be waterproof so far though. The house is spacious with a large door (I purchased the plastic-strip door made to go with the house). I don't know how warm the structure will be in deep winter since it is only wood and not insulated, but it is in the corner of my deck tucked in against the house with a partial roof overhang. I have stuffed the plastic strips that it was shipped with underneath the house and on two sides. The house was packaged fairly well. There was a tiny crack on one of the slats on the roof, but it will not hurt the functionality, so I kept it as is. It was easy to put together with an electric screw driver and I was alone. Another person would have been helpful to hold up the sides while screwing together. It is well made, sturdy and quite attractive. On review, well worth the money and I would definitely buy again."
"This is much smaller than anticipated. It is cheap and does the job, but if you have a dog bigger than 30 pounds, get something larger! I have to refill the water almost every time he drinks out of it."
"I've tried it all - Proactiv, creams prescribed from the doctor, drugstore brand washes....nothing has worked since I started getting acne in middle school! I use this toner after washing with Clean and Clear's Deep Action Exfoliating scrub and my acne has significantly been reduced! I don't know why this doesn't have more reviews, it's a heaven sent product! The only negative is the smell, but that goes away after a minute :)"
These blocks are beautiful - high quality and vivid colors. And the perfect gift for a Greek child. I bought then for my niece and she loves them!
"Pet fountains are a great way to keep my cat from trying to drink out of the faucets. I bought the Fresh Flow a few years ago and thought it was great, but the plastic it is made of is not the best quality and the filter clogs up constantly. I finally threw the Fresh Flow out today after several successful months with the Drinkwell Pet Fountain. The Drinkwell Pet Fountain is definitely a better quality product and hasn't clogged up once! The Drinkwell Pet Fountain also holds more water (even without the extra resevior) than the Petmate Fresh Flow. If I could go back in time, I would have paid the extra $10 for the Drinkwell instead of paying for both in the long run."
"This is the best product ever invented! It keeps the oil and shine away for up to 8 hours, I only wish it was available in a more 'manly' package! he he, I would feel better that way, but I really don't care as long as it works. All guys should try this in addition to women."
"I have used body lotion from head to toe since as far back as I can remember. Got the habit from my mother who uses Pond's Cold Cream all over her body (ick). She is in her 70s, looks like she is in her 40s and her skin is amazing. Clearly she is on to something.My thyroid quit working which caused my skin to become extremely dry. I switched my regular lotion to this Aveeno after endless sleepless nights scratching my skin off. This product was a life saver, it competely relieved the constant itching immediately. I could not live without it. It keeps my skin moist but not greasy all day and has a slight menthol fragrance (barely noticeable). It just smells clean and fresh.I get nervous when I cannot find it in my local stores. When I do find it, I usually buy every bottle. Since this product plays such a pivotable role in my skin health, I have decided not to rely on the chance I can find it locally. Buying it on Amazon allows for me to stock up on my terms. Another good selling point is that it is less expensive per bottle (excluding shipping) than local prices. I consider the shipping costs a ""piece-of-mind"" fee for having it delivered to my door.If you have itchy, dry, painful skin this is a wonderful relief."
"This is a great game! It's designed for two players. The pieces are all of high quality. The game itself usually takes only 15-30 minutes to play, which is nice -- it's quick and doesn't drag on. Also, because of the design, you feel like you're playing a new game every time you play it. It's not a game you can play every night (it'd get old), but we pull it out maybe 3-4 times a month and have fun with it. This game is fun for adults, and I think it would be fun and easy to play for children, too (I don't have kids so I'm not sure...)."
"This toy believed in me, and helped me succeed in getting the little square into the big square. I was delighted hence I got it in, and showed my owner ,Harold, how proud I was. He must have gotten mad. Humans are so primitive. To show appreciation, they say something, instead of peeing on the floor, like us dogs do. Well, I am still working on this circle, but you will all feel the wetness of my excitement when I am finished."
Our two chihuahuas love this toy. The are 3 and 5 lbs and this toy is just right for them.
"My son received this for Christmas. He was 4 months old at the time. I knew it would be a little advanced for him, but he loves plushies so I wanted it awhile. He has now learned how to push and grab the buttons to make it talk and sing. He loves it! It will entertain him for a precious 15 minutes so I can catch up with work around the house. This is a great toy for little ones who love stuffed animals since it is cuddly, makes sound, AND has lights... all things babies love!"
"This toy is so awesome! Now no more stupid duel mats or spilling on your cards. This is totally portable so you can play in the car,in a train,even outside. The mats were okay,but this makes duelin alot more fun. This needs some adjustments like the spell and trap card slots need 2 be below the monsters. I also wish there were hologram projectors but we're so far away from that. Other than those 2 flaws,it's the perfect toy. I think it's the perfect gift if your kids love Yu-Gi-Oh! So i suggest getting this 4 them. I hope my review helped. P.S. I have loved Yu-Gi-Oh! since the first day it was aired on KidsWB so i know alot."
"My wife loves this cologne. There is not much more to say other than when I put it on, she likes to be near. Isn't that the entire purpose of cologne? I have been looking everywhere for this for some time, so I'm glad Amazon had it."
"The toy name is General Graveous from Star Wars, my nephew really liked a lot and he enjoyed everytime he plays with it.I bought the toy fro hin for his birthday, he is been asking for long time."
This masque is a great old standby drugstore product that really does work. The only problem is that it ususlly is sold in a plastic tube that makes it difficult to get all the product out when the tube becomes low. Problem solved with this handy bin!
"They toy is great. My five month old just isn't happy unless he is standing up! The table will scoot around so we need to make sure to help steady the table, especially since our baby is just learning to stand. He loves standing at it and hitting all the buttons, he loves the spinner and the little snack box. . . he keeps opening and closing the door. We haven't had the table flip over, but again we are right there with him helping him stand and support himself. I would think twice about using Amazon's frustration free packaging. I saw this toy at walmart for the same price but the one at walmart came with batteries. I ended up getting it from amazon and while the frustration free packing was kind of nice, it did not come with batteries"
"Excellent product with excellent customer service.When my first package did not arrive in time, mailed the customer care and then they sent a replacement package immediately without even asking questions.Is a really good product which I use for my hair treatment. Good value for money."
So far I like the item. I talked to a sylist and they said that I got a good buy.
"My husband and I purchased this the night we decided that out little one had to sleep in her own crib. We knew she loved to look at herself in the mirror and we thought the mirror would make her feel secure and happy while in the crib by herself...sure enough we were right!! That night she went to sleep for the first time in her crib with the help of this product. She babbled to herself, cried a little and eventually fell asleep. We believe that this mirror is what helped her get to sleep on her own. Give this product a try...its cheap and for what it gave us...SLEEP...it sure was worth it...Good luck!!"
"It's difficult to find a shampoo without SLS, even in color-care shampoos, so I was excited to try this (I also try to use ""natural"" products). Unfortunately, after just a few uses, I noticed that the color seemed stripped right out of my hair. What a waste of money on shampoo AND expensive color! I did like the smell, however, and the low lather was not a problem. Guess I'll donate the remaining product to a friend."
"I ordered White Diamonds EAU de Parfum and received EAU de Toilette. This product came from Target. Amazon was very good at giving me a complete refund and did not have me send the Toilette back.I then ordered the same thing directly from Target. The very same thing happened. Target has been more difficult to work with. Basically, I do all the work inorder to get a refund when the mistake is on their part. Amazon is great to work with."
I bought this for my cat because his water bowl was always empty and my work schedule varies so this product helps make sure that my cat has water all the time. I just add more water once a week. This is a really great product and I enjoy it as well as my cat.
"We got this feeder for our cats for Christmas. Of course when it arrived a week before, we had to put it together and start using it. Us and our cats love it. The cats are getting used to their feeding schedule, and I'm sure they will maintain their healthy weight, or even loose a pound or two. Even our three year old little girl gets excited when the it's time for the feeder to put out the food. She giggles and dances around. The timer took us a few tries to finally get it right, but once we got it figured out- it was very easy. I would recommend this product to any pet owner concerned with portion control or for anyone that is out of town a lot and wants the piece of mind that their beloved pet is getting the exact amount of food they need."
This was a gift from a family friend. It din't attach to the carseat properly therefore placing it on my daughters laps just made her mad and she would kick it into the floor. I DID like the remote....when it worked. And the music...well...could of been better.
"I have four dogs so I thought this collar would be the perfect solution to the foul smelling collars they become after a few months!! I was right!! I have had this collar, in orange, for a few months now and it is still as good as new! No smell and it is so easy to clean! The orange looks great on my little black pug! The other 3 are waiting on their's now!! Great product!!"
"Great de-shedding tool. I Have a medium sized mixed breed dog, that shed like crazy. I use it about once a month (same day I give her the heartworm preventative medication, so I dont forget) and her shedding has been seriously cut down. It does not stop all shedding, but it does reduce it to a much more manageable rate. I definately suggest it for anyone with a dog that sheds!"
"I was just looking through the actual JASON store and i did not find this product in their stock. Real JASON's Aloe Vera Beauty Oil only has 3 ingredients in it.This product has way to many ingredients to be a JASON's product especially for something as simple as beauty oil.What I'm saying is i think this product is fake and certainly unhealthy as compared to real JASON's Aloe Vera Beauty Oil which only has 3 natural ingredients in it.The ingredient Methylparaben has been found to be harmful to humans and banned in Europe. Plus if it's perfumed chances are it's got alcohol in it and it's a damn shame if your trying to be healthy and putting alcohol on your skin because it does nothing but dry your skin.[...]People be smart about what you buy...if it's on amazon then it's most likely somewhere else...do research, don't be naive and buy with full trust."
I had a really hard time finding a somewhat affordable natural canned food for our puppy. I was having problems with him eating just his kibble so on a whim I tried a little bit of this mixed in and he LOVED IT. Ever since I've been buying in bulk on amazon..its cheapest here.
If you have multiple dogs or double coated breeds this is the brush for you. I love this brush. The smaller size is prefect for small to medium breeds and great for cats as well.
"My daughter received this as a birthday present and she loves it, but it only recognizes the first 2 pages so we are exchanging it today for one that works. She is already learning the sounds of the letters A through F and it is amazing. It is a great toy, but just needs to be more durable especially for the age group it was designed for."
The product didn't have as strong of an aroma as it does when I test it in the department stores.
"Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is one of my favorite cleansers. I love it because when I wash my face with it, my eye make-up comes off without irritating my eyes. I also like the fact that it's unscented."
"I love this thing. It takes so much fur off my two cats and chihuahua. The only problem I see is that on one of my cats, I guess I brushed a bit too much in a couple of sections and now he has a few bald spots :)Luckily fur grows back and I'll be more careful next time. They love it though and come running when they see it in my hand. Even the dog loves it and he has always been afraid of combs and brushes. This one he doesn't run from.Worth the price in my opinion."
"We are using this product on our black lad pup. Her coat looks amazing. We are also giving it to our 11 year old english field cocker. He needs a hair cut in a bad way, so it's hard to see his undercoat. Love the product and will buy it again....."
"My husband loves this products, but WalMart no longer carries it, but I will continue to order it on line.Thank you."
Someone spoke highly about these so I decided to give them a try. I really like them and can notice a difference after only a month. Only thing is you have to make sure to increase your water intake because it will make your urine smell
I have tried all of the flea medications out there for fleas. This is the only one that works. And this is the only one that my Vet gave to me to use on my cat. And it is alot cheaper here than at the Vets office!!Put between the shoulder blades or on the middle of the back.. Believe me you will find that spot that your cat can not lick...
"This product is amazing, it really does work. it kept my cat from messing my home up, and i have a house filled with carpet. but i Definetly think it needs a better or stronger adhesive to be kept on."
Bought this for my hubby for our anniversary. He has been dying to have this again. Once he used it all up we couldn't find it anywhere. We ended up finding it in a place they opened up in the mall but they wanted 3 times what I paid for it on here. Now my hubby is very happy to have his favorite scent back and I'm a very happy wife with extra money in my pocket for other items :)
The game
"I purchased the small tube. Upon opening it, the texture did appear odd, and seemed watered down, which led to me think that the product was old. I decided to give it a try, but it worked well to my wonder! My hair was very moisturized, and detangled with such ease."
"Ok, so he looks cool. An edgy redition of the batman for sure. Purchased it for my 3 year old son as a Christmas present. I'm pretty sure this thing is best left in the box. Short of that, he should be taken out of the box with care, affixed to his platform, and placed on a high (out of the way shelf). Within 10 seconds, one leg had broken off, in another 10 seconds an arm had come off. Basically he was just articulating the arms and legs not pulling them or squeezing them. Where the pins fractured the plastic looks ridgid and glassy. It's a huge disappointment, I wish I had known it was not for play, hope this post saves someone the trouble. This really stinks because my son loved it."
"I bought this toy for my son who is 2 years old for Christmas and I can't decide who likes it more, my husband and I or him! There are many different fun things to learn with this toy...different instruments, shapes, and moving your body to the beat. The sound is stereo-like and we are ordering the additional cartridges."
"This is an excellent product and does well exactly what it claims to do. There is no lingering cat box odor. I wish I had this product years ago!It was well packaged and received in good order - and quickly. As this item was completely unknown to me, I had to rely on the instruction to assemble. They were not crystal clear, but nevertheless I did get it together and after the fact, it really was a piece of cake to put together. Also the item is shown in blue and white, but arrived as two shades of tan. This did not displease me or my cat. Blue is not her favorite color anyway.It does come with one cartridge of the bag material, but it's worth buying a set (or 2) of extra bag refills. If you love your cat you're going to be delighted with this product for waste disposal."
"My daughter had a rare blood disorder that resulted in widespread scleraderma on her arm. This causes hardening of the tissues, skin problems, and loss of function in her hand. All in all, a nightmare for this young woman.She was introduced to this therapy by her hand and arm physical therapist. It helped her greatly, and they decided that daily therapy at home would be a huge benefit. We purchased this unit, which, for all intents and purposes, is the same as the professional unit used by her therapists.We have hope that systemic drug therapy will eventually reverse and even cure the scleraderma, but we think the wax treatments are essential to prevent further damage in the interim. If it can help someone like my daughter, then it should be a fine option for many people with less severe skin conditions."
I am sure many of Creed's customers enjoy this scent Like No Other. Of all Creed's many accomplishments Bois du Portugal is true Timeless Fragrance. Of All My Father's Gifts This Is The One I Treasure Most.
"This scent is only for divas!! It is heady and believe me, you will be noticed!! However, it can overwhelm any one if you over spray it, so use it sparingly!Enjoy this beautiful scent!"
"The figure is scupted quite nicely and has a very good likeness of the masked Doom. He has the usual Toy Biz rotacast articulation ut bthe important this is I had problems with his shoulders and we has to get rid of some excess plastic on the right shoulder joint. The shoulders are not easy to move and I recommend being careful. Other Than that he is an excellent figure taht stands well and looks awesom nex to all of the other movie 12"" Fantastic Four figures. If you are a huge fan like Me I strongly recommend to get all of them especially this figure!"
"This toy is on the wanted list fro even 6-13 year olds because it has all of the accessories you need. I believe it is too high of a price but it is still worth it.With its MP3,video and other things!"
Initially this was not the picture in place for this item and so I received this thinking it was a different model and had it returned and was refunded excluding my shipping costs. I set my hair with full rollers and a head of full rollers cannot fit under this hood and dry properly. So if you are purchasing this for setting your hair think twice. If you're purchasing for just drying your hair I guess it might work.
"Ok, duh, this is not a game for children who still put everything in their mouth. If you are big into prayer you probably won't like it. I am neither and love it. You can do almost anything to the figures and they won't break. If they do the company will replace them. This game is all the fun of Warhammer, with a lot less work. The click dials keep track of all the point values and special abilities. If you like to paint figures, you can get them individually, made out of pewter, and unique. It is easy to learn and easy to play. I would recommend this toy for children 8 and up."
"have a silky terrier...with the cold weather here in the northeast, its impossible to take my dog for walks...had a PEE pad in the house for over two weeks and the dog never used it. Bought the spray and still no luck. Put the pad outside and the dog pee'd everywhere but the pad. Even with the spray wasn't much luck. Finally I started spaying the pad before we let the dog out, without the dog seeing me so it would think another dog used his pad. IT FINALLY WORKED! even after a while the dog stopped peeing on the pad, and used the spay and almost right away went on the pad. Now i use this spray sparlingly, the key is just to have it go on the pad once with the spay. Def. works well with a handful of treats!"
"If you love strategy games, then you must love Stratego. It is all about strategy. You prepare your battle field, army, bombs & flag then when the game starts you have to strategize when to attack, defend or retreat !Chess is a very classic game that I love... it is very classic. If Chess is the game of the early ages, Stratego is the game of the 20th century. If you are a professional Chess player you'd become a professional Stratego player as well.[...]Play this game with smart & challenging players and you'd have the time of your life."
"This round brush is the perfect size for my hair (shoulder length with layers) and does its best to not completely relieve me of all of my hair, which is babyfine and will fall out if at all looked at funny. Does a great job when I actually bother to blow out my hair."
My cats LOVED this! They were always swatting at the faucet or dripping water in the shower so this does not bother them one bit! they both like to play with the stream and catch water then lick it from their paws. its so cute to see! very durable and wont tip over. works great!
"Last year donated my hair, so I got a new hair-do. The stylist was using a straigtner and my sisters also had started to use a straightner. I decided to get myslef one as well. This one is great becuase I don't need to blow dry my hair before I use it and the plates are big. My sisters all love my straightner. I bought one for my sister for Chirstmas and now my sister-in-law is looking to buy this straightner as well. I have no complaints after using it for a year."
"I already had one of these mask. It was getting old, so I bought a new one. This machine works. It stimulates the circulation in the face."
"I love Playmobil for the detail and sturdiness. Yes, pieces come off and need to be put back on, but that feature also allows children to engage more fully with the toy and lash Barbie to the riggings, for example.My 2 year old recently discovered the ship and was thrilled. It's big for him, on the verge of being too big to carry, but that seems to be ok for him. You should also have a large bathtub if you want to sail it in the bath because of it's size. Be aware that the goblets can get stuck in your drain so make certain you get them all out before you pull the plug, or you'll be getting a shop vac to pull the pieces out of the drain trap.My children love combining all the pieces of different sets so not only does Barbie go sailing with the pirates, but so do farm tractors and a Pride of Lions. Wonderful fun, but save the reassembly directions for all your Playmobil in a binder."
"What do I look for a good product is something really work, and it's not over priced. If you are looking for the same thing, than this is the right one for you. I purchased this product from Amazon, and I got my item in about 3 days, very fast, love it. When I used this product first time, didn't like it that much, because I didn't really know how to use it. It's very different from the regular curl iron. However, I tried it again, and then I love it after the second time. It styled my hair wonderfully. I love this product..."
"On the first use (following their instruction booklet exactly), this dryer burned off whole sections of my hair. After complaining to Revlon, I was instructed to contact the manufacturer, Helen of Troy. Frankly, if you're going to put your name on something my feeling is that you should stand by the product yourself and not send consumers on a wild goose chase to track down the responsible party!Instead I contacted the US Consumer Product Safety Commission via email and I received a phonecall from them. They sent an agent out to my home, purchased this dangerous dryer for cash, took pictures of all the burnt hair (yes, I saved all evidence) and I expect as there are many complaints about this product they will soon recall it.Don't buy this dryer or any other Revlon hair products. They are faulty and Revlon does not care about customer service, either."
"I purchased this product a few of years ago. Initially it seemed to be a good product. It lasted for several months, and then the problems set in.1) The dispensing bowl is attached to the reservoir bowl by two plastic nuts that thread onto two threaded plastic shafts extending from the dispensing bowl. There is also a small plastic tube that extends from the dispensing bowl, and fits into a receptacle in the reservoir bowl body. The tube is sealed to the receptacle by two small recessed O-rings. These O-rings are junk. During assembly the O-rings will twist and bind against each other preventing a good seal. Which in turn, will result in an empty waterer and a flooded floor? - My fix, use a food grade silicone to seal the tube to the receptacle. Problem solved; no big deal.2) The filters that are used with this unit are also complete junk. They are a multi-layered filter, with each layer of filtration ""supposedly"" providing a beneficial purpose. However, this filter frequently becomes clogged. The first layer of filtration is a particulate screen; good in concept - bad in implementation. The useable surface area of this screen is less than an inch in diameter, so any debris (usually food particles and hair) that falls into the reservoir bowl will clog this filter fairly quickly. It usually takes about a week to clog it up. Once it becomes clogged, the water no longer flows. Well, so much for filtered water.3) An easy way to unclog the filter is to back-flush it. Weekly back-flushing will extend the filter life for about a month before it has to be replaced. The filters originally came four to a pack, then three to a pack, now only two to a pack, but the price has never decreased. Ok, blame it on inflation. (Greed?)4) The pump actually seems to be quite hardy. It has never had a problem. However, the water flows into the pump before it passes through the filter. This arrangement causes debris to get caught around the impeller of the pump (mainly hair), and the water flow slows down to a crawl. - My fix, remove the pump from the reservoir bowl, dissemble the pump, remove and clean the impeller, and reassemble. Well, so much for unattended watering.5) The original reservoir bottle was made from a fairly durable plastic, and it lasted about two years; then once again my floor began to flood repeatedly. This time the problem was problem much harder to diagnose. The reservoir bottle developed a small crack underneath the screw-on lifting handle. The cracked reservoir bottle could no longer sustain a vacuum, and would empty its contents as fast as the air can flow in through the crack. I tried to seal the crack using the food grade silicone, but unfortunately the silicone would begin to leak as well. So, I ordered a replacement reservoir bottle.6) The replacement reservoir bottle was made from a thin flexible plastic. I initially assumed the thin flexible plastic was an upgrade to make the bottle more resistant to cracking. Wrong. About 2 months after I replaced the bottle, my floor began to flood once again. This time the flooding was very infrequent, and I thought perhaps my pets were just being messy. I didn't even suspect the new bottle was cracked until my floor was once again flooded regularly. Once I discovered the crack under the screw-on lifting handle I called Ergosys, and requested a warranty replacement for the bottle. I was told even though the product was clearly defective and that it shouldn't have cracked, I would have to purchase a new bottle because, the 1 year warranty had expired yesterday. (Yes, that was the final straw and impetus for this review)7) There is a removable centering device for the bottle. It resides in the reservoir bowl, and helps guide and support the bottle into place during bottle installation. This centering device is another piece of junk. It cracks more frequently than the bottle. The cracks seem to have little effect on the performance of the waterer, but why is it cracking in the first place?Despite the good rating from other reviewers, I would caution against relying on this unit to provide prolonged unattended watering for your pets (a week if your lucky). Furthermore, I definitely would NOT recommend using this unit near a wooden floor or carpeting; it is simply too prone to flooding the floor.I do not own the large pet waterer, but it stands to reason the large and medium pet waterers may also be prone to these same problems.Buyer beware!"
"I like it. some review said it is fake, but I think it smells same to the mall I saw. I believe Amazon is a great company and won't sell fake product."
I absolutely love this fragrance!!! It has become my daily fragrance this season. The scent is not overpowering and it lasts through the day.
"Why is this figure purple? The symbiote is black, Spidey's black suit is black of course, so this figure should be black too. Hasbro really screwed the pooch on the entire Spidey 3 figure line. Don't waste your moneyon these figures. You can do a lot better than these plastic pieces of garbage."
"I bought 2 of these when we adopted 2 young Maine Coon cats, at the recommendation of their foster mom. She noted that both cats loved the ones she had in her house and they were sturdy enough for Maine Coons (big cats). She was right, 4 months later I don't know what we would have done without them. They are excellent scratching posts (save my furniture) and the kitties will spend hours on them watching birds through the window (kitty tv). The cats leap on them, sleep on them, hang from them and chase each other over, around, and under them, and after 4 months of very heavy use, they still look like new. And they haven't even come close to toppling over yet. I even liked the price, and with Amazon Prime, no shipping fees, and it arrives in 2 days. I know I sound like an advertisement, but I can't think of a bad thing to say about these cots. The cats love them and so do I. Well, okay, I'd be happier if they vacuumed themselves- Maine Coons have a lot of hair.I'm about to foster a Maine Coon, so knowing I'd better have another Kitty Cot, I've just placed my order for #3.I'm back almost a year after posting the above review to say these cots get used on a daily basis and they are still in excellent condition, and the cats still love them."
"This perfume is absolutely divine! I have been trying for years to find a light, sweet, floral perfume that didn't smell like sickening sweet cotton candy or bubble-gum. I've found it. I did a google search a few weeks ago entering in ""best selling perfume for women"" and the website Auric Blends came up with Egyptian Goddess listed on the site. I took a chance. I had no idea what the perfume would smell like ... I just knew that I needed to try something new and I knew that I did not want to pay $24 for a 1.07 ounce bottle just in case I hated it. I decided to try the $7 roll on fragrance. Oh, I'm so sorry that I didn't buy the larger bottle now!This oil based perfume is a sweet, soft musk smell with floral undertones... the minute I rolled this water of the nile on my wrists, my mood lifted tremendously. I'm a big aromatherapy fan -- love incense and aromatic oils and fragrant soaps... all that great stuff. This being an oil based perfume will ensure that the fragrance lasts. Oh, I love this stuff so much. Now I have two favorite perfumes"
Our son loved this car. He used it a lot when learning to walk. Just make sure you get it snapped into position when using it for walking. After using it for walking he used it as a car. He got good use out of it.
$28.99 The week before XMas ?!!! Crazy ! I found it for $13 (and not even in sale) at my local Target.I will update my review on the toy itself after XMas and when my son will have gotten some time to play with it.
"You can definitely pick up the rose, apple, and musk notes in this perfume. It's one of my new favorites. I usually like a heavier perfume (Vera Wang is one of my trademark scents), but Light Blue is aromatic and pleasing to the nose as well! Although its recommended use is 'casual,' Light Blue would be appropriate formally as well. (Another light scent to try if you like Light Blue"
Help was definitely needed to get this toy out of the box! You can't imagine how hard it was to have a child anxiously waiting to play with Tekno and the adults could not get it out of it's box. Certainly they should have a better and easier way to package this toy!
"I bought a LeapFrog for my then 4-year-old grandson last year, and his 2-year-old brother loves to use it so much that his mother suggested I get him one of his own (in another color, of course.) The older boy brought his when the family came here for Xmas and was constantly using it. When the 2-year-old opened his gift, he wouldn't put it down. I've never seen either boy so fascinated with a ""toy"" for so long a time. It's really a wonderful educational and and fun product."
"A friend loaned me her bottle of Mavala Stop. I was skeptical and didn't want to buy my own bottle until I knew that it was effective. My 3 year old was a finger sucker big time. I applied one coat on the two finger nails of the fingers that she sucked and the habit was broken in 3 days. She was unable to wash it off, even after a bath it was still on. She was so proud of herself, it's now been 8 months since she sucked her fingers, and she hasn't gone back at all. So I finally bought my own bottle of it for my 5 year old who is a nail biter. It's taken a little longer, but she is no longer a nail biter. This product was very effective, and the kids did great, they wanted me to put it on them, it was a sense of relief to them to have some help."
Love the Cat Lady! She makes a GREAT gift too. If she had accessories I would get them too. Like a cat bowls and a cat box.I bought two Cat Lady sets as Christmas presents for deserving friends and they went over really well. They LOVED them!
"In general, my cat is pretty indifferent when it comes to store-bought toys. She tends to prefer balls of tinfoil, paper bags, cardboard, etc. The first few days, she was not really into these. Then she saw the way they bounced and rolled on the linoleum kitchen floor and is now completely hooked. She goes totally nuts; smacking into cupboards and rolling all over the floor playing with these. The plastic is stiff enough that they roll well but pliable enough that she can pick it up in her mouth, chew it (she's never broken off a piece to eat), stick her paw through the middle; it's hilarious to watch. They are pretty hardy so even when you inevitably step on them in the dark, they bounce back into shape pretty well. My only complaint is that they only come 3 per pack. If I could buy bulk, I would because there is an entire pack under my refrigerator right now! Every time my kitty gets one stuck under something, she goes nuts trying to get it out, so if I can't get it easily I break out another. They used to sell these at one of the chain pet stores but not anymore. I recommend buying 2 packs at a time cuz they will be under your furniture pretty quickly!"
"este perfume no huele a nada! al momento de ponertelo viene un olor bonito, pero el olor desaparece en un minuto o menos,no vale la pena comprarlo, hay otros perfumes de Antonio Banderas que huelen bonito"
"I received the chocolate henna hair cream instead of the mahogany. I used it anyways. It added a nice natural shine, but didn't really change the color of my hair since my hair is already chocolate. The shine didn't seem to last that long, maybe three weeks. Overall, I was not too pleased."
I have enjoyed this product. It is mind challenging. I bought one for myself and also my students that I tutor.
The service that I received was very good. The items were as described and they arrived when I expected them. I will certainly be ordering again.
"I ALSO GAVE IN TO THE HYPE ABOUT THIS PRODUCT, I BOUGHT HOPING IT WOULD WORK TO ELIMINATE PREMATURE HAIRLINE WRINKLES, I USED IT RELIGIOUSLY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS 2 TO 3 TIMES A DAY AS DIRECTED. I EXPECTED TO SEE VISIBLE RESULTS, WELL AFTER USING IT FOR A FEW MONTHS AND NOT NOTICING ANY DIFFERENCE I DEFINITELY GAVE UP ON IT, THEN I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE FOUND A NEW PRODUCT ""KIRALY"" WHAT A DIFFERENCE, KIRALY WORKED MUCH BETTER THAN THIS PRODUCT AND AFTE USING IT FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS, I HAVE NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE AND I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE NOTICING IT, MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY HAVE NOTICE IT TO. AS EVIDENCED BY THEIR COMMENTS; ""WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO YOUR FACE? YOU LOOK YOUNGER!"" ""DID YOU HAVE BOTOX INJECTIONS? AND SO ON. I LOOK TEN YEARS YOUNGER!!! THANKS TO KIRALY. IF ANY OF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT WHICH TRULY SOFTENS AND ELIMINATES HAIRLINE WRINKLES YOU HAVE TO TRY KIRALY INSTEAD OF STRIVECTIN-SD. I BET ONCE YOU TRY ""KIRALY"" YOU WILL NOT WANT TO USE ANYTHING ELSE."
"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas. I spent hours debating between this, leap frog, leapster, etc. After I decided on InteracTV DVD, I started reading the reviews on Amazon and I became very concerned about how hard it was going to be to program into the DVD player. I almost took it back without even trying it... glad I didn't! It took all of 3 mintues to program... worked with the very first code! I was so happy!! My daughter has caught onto the game very quickly and really enjoys playing it. The only negative I would say is that she has found the 'Dora the Explorer' dvd to be a little difficult with the spanish words and all. She does enjoy the Blues Clues and Barney ones though!"
"I've compared this phaser to a replica made from the original mold. Aside from being lighter, and not metal like the replica, this thing looks as good, if not a little better than the replica!"
"My 4-year old loves this game, and consequently I have played it about 50,000 times. I actually enjoy it also. In games like Candyland and Chutes and Ladders, I usually end up cheating just to make the miserable game end (I'm not mean - I usually cheat to let my son win :). I usually don't get tired of this one. There are lots of things that will occupy a 4-year old. It is difficult to find something that will occupy the young and old alike."
Very Frustrating...Instructions were absolutely terrible & incomplete.Set did not even come with the pieces required to build the saucer.Save yourself some grief and look for something else!
"The Westing Game is a very intresting and a &quot;different&quot; book. I enjoyed it because I like mysteries,and this book keeped you reading on and keeped you on your toes. It made you really pay attention and really think about what you were reading. I really enjoyed it and I think you will enjoy it too!"
My family's mini-weanie loves these things. Just be careful to have other chewable toys so your dog isn't ingesting a bunch of plastic because it will upset their stomach a little.
"I thought this would be a hit for my daughter who is 9 months old when I saw her playing with a similar table at daycare. For some reason when I got this home she can't seem to play with it unless I am standing by her. Must be a seperation thing. Anwyays it has spanish or english settings and music or words. You can flip the ""pages"" of the book to change between music or singing and she loves to flip back and forth, I almost wish there were more pages to flip through. I love the look of the table, the songs, etc. I wish it was a tad bit taller as soon she will be hovering over it but its not a huge deal. At the end of the day it was another toy that I thought would make my job as a parent easier, but nothing so far has done that...:)"
"the arms on the clock fell off and the squeaker in the center should be near the side. you can't lay flat wiht that in the middle. so my 3 yr old would get mad at it after a certain point. i rarely used it wiht my 2nd baby. she liked the mirror and the other side was enough to hold her attention for 20 minutes. the gym matt that i had with the bars of toys that hung over their heads kept her busy for hours on end. i would go wiht that over this one. storage wise it's a great product it has it's own bag to keep it in. it cleans well, and it kept them off the floors of houses we would visit wiht friends and family. so that was a defiante plus."
"The dog I bought the bed for won't get in it, but the other two love it. I think she doesn't use it because it is a bit difficult for her to get out of it. She is a senior dog. The bed seems well made and is light weight. I haven't tried washing it yet, but it should wash and dry easily. I consider it a good value for the money."
"These were cool action figures. What makes it educational is it shows the batman from a golden age to a modern age. It is not really a toy it is more of a collectors item because the modern batman""s arm got off after leaving it on a shelf for 2 yeas."
"it pickes up the poop so i don't have to touch it. what else is there to say. Seems well built, not too loose and the teeth are aluminum i think."
"My only complaint is that I should have ordered at least two. My kids argue whose turn it is and/or become impatient waiting for their turn. Since the turns can be long, the impatience is understandable. My kids are 4, 7, 10, 12, 16, 18, and 21. EVERYONE LOVES THIS GAME!!! The 4 yr old loves to set up the cars. It's great for her in developing matching and spatial relationships between objects. Then she moves the cars anyway she wants to win. I'm definitely ordering the railroad and safari rush hours for my family. Great game!"
"My two Italian greyhounds recieved this toy for Christmas and it was the highlight of the day for them. Sharing was a problem (should have gotten 2!) but we worked out a scedule. I.G.'s are not terribly aggressive chewers so it took them the entire day to remove every trace of the chewy part. Even without the chewy parts, they still liked it."
"We bought this for our son at 9 months and it was a hit from the start. He's now 15 months and it is still one of his all time favorites. It occurred to me just now when I saw him go to it AGAIN that we are as entertained by it as he is and that the novelty of it has never worn off. I've recommended it to several moms and grandmothers. I think it will continue to be a favorite for a long time. And the price is slightly higher than a lot of infant toys, but it's well worth it."
This is the best under $... toy to be found! I bought this for my 16th month old for Christmas and 1 month later at 17 months old she is able to recite the alphabet A-F in just 1 month! And is learning more everyday! In her toddler tantrums it has been thrown to the hard floor many times and is still working! Also 2 letter tiles have made it thru the dishwasher and they still keep working to! This by far is the best toy I've seen! It's cheap/educational and Tuff!GREAT JOB Leap Frog!
Bought this as a gift for my friend's new baby! They loved it! Great toy set!
"Been using it for years,the price is great, the fragance is very subtle and the woman swoon What elese can I say"
I have used this conditioner for many years and the real Paul Mitchell detangler is wonderful. I purchased some from this seller on Amazon and it is NOT the same product. It has a horrible smell and leaves my hair dryed out. It is NOT Paul Mitchell. I would demand my money back but it would be expensive to send back the 3 bottles I purchased. Stupid me for ordering so many.
"We bought this for our 5 year old son and he has been having a great time with it. The magnetic pieces do tend to get scattered around the house but we are trying to stay on top of that. Otherwise, he enjoys making pictures on his own and also copying the samples provided on the cover."
"This past month i was on vacation visiting my family in Panama. I took out the Uno Cards one night and we started playing. My cousins got addicted and wanted to play every night so we did. The second night i decided to spice it up a bit and add these blank colored cards that i guess come in the packaging as replacements and decided to use them as any card other than a Wild or Wild Draw Four card, meaning it can be used as a regular color and number card, a draw two, skip, or Reverse card. Ah man we had so much fun after i did that, that we kept using the idea, and made the game so much more fun. The last couple of nights we played before i had to leave, just 1 hand took us about a couple of hours to finish, it was like playing a game of Monopoly that you didn't know when it was going to finish as it was back and forth all night. I played with a strategy in mind whch was to prevent anyone but myself from winnning when they were low on cards and i had like 20 cards in my hand and all of them were draw twos and draw four cards and i combined them all in one play and kept the Wild Draw four as my ""Uno"" card to automatically win the game. It was alot of fun and had me realizing how much fun Uno can be if you set your own rules sometimes to mix it up and keep it fun."
"We have had this almost a year and my lab/boxer mix loves it! He will nose it around the house for hours. We have had a ton of toys that he plays with occasionally but this one gets played with every day. He has gotten very creative in ways to get the treats out. The first day we gave it to him he went to the top of the stairs and dropped it so the some treats came out as it dropped down the stairs. We use the mini treat bones that are oraganically made so they are still good for him. I don't put his food in it, the bones are shaped enough that they don't fall out easily so it takes a little work. He will work on it all day! He gets bored very easily and this has been a wonderful diversion for him. I am getting ready to purchase our second one as the first is starting to wear out. He has discovered he can position the hole above his mouth and tilt his head back. Then he will squeeze a little and sometimes bones will fall in his mouth. This has resulted in it cracking a little. But like I said we have had it almost a year and it has outlast any other toy he has had!"
"I have been searching for the perfect handheld sudoku game and this is not it. I found it very difficult to see the numbers without a backlight even with my reading glasses. Also I would perfer a stylus pen instead of having to scroll around the screen to enter a number. I do like the idea of being able to use a dry erase pen to mark off numbers, but I couldn't even see those. Still searching!"
"Buyer beware! I was looking for a replacement of my Doskocil litter scooper and this seemed to look the same on the website... what a disappointment when I got it!My old Doskocil is the only litter scooper on the market that I know of that actually filters scoopable litter effectively because it has a 3/16 inch ridge at the lowest point of the pan, right where the smallest solid pieces of the sifted litter collect. Ideally this ridge would be even twice as wide. The scooper I received does have a narrow solid part but on a slope, not the lowest part of the pan... so, it is of no use whatsoever to sift out the small solid parts (the most difficult to get out). Does anybody know of any scooper that is like my old Doskocil, i.e. that has an angle and a ridge across the pan? gabimaus@pacbell.net"
"I have two 17 month old Lab brothers. My Yellow Lab, Augie, adores this ball. I bought them the Jolly ball with the handle when they were puppies, and although they still play with it, the handle is long-gone. When I got this one with the rope, they eventually chewed through the rope. I went to the local odd lots-type store and bought a pack of similar size rope and cut a new piece, knotted it into the ball and they were ready to roll. I got the rope for about $4 and there is probably enough to replace it 5 or 6 times.This ball is the first thing Augie goes for when he goes outside, & he tries to bring it into the house every day. It is great because they can grab it by the rope. The two dogs run through the yard holding the rope at the same time. When they run the ball flies around, which I think adds to the fun. Augie also grabs the ball by the rope & swings it up for me grab so I can throw it. He will fetch this ball until I make him stop (Due to dragging tongue). Another plus is, when they drop it for you to throw, the rope keeps it from rolling away. I would recommend this to anyone."
"I recently bought the Battat Busy Zoo for a gift. It is so cute! No issues with paint and I found it to be very well constructed. I saw some reviews saying to buy it at Target.com, it is actually cheaper at Amazon.com when you factor the freight costs. I saved almost 15%! So do your homework. Great item and value."
I always find her sucking the green trianlge. My 6 month old loves this toy.
"He is still interested in the ball once a while after a month. However, the scratch pad has constantly been used, and becomes the only stuff he scratches on."
I have bought Mania by Giorgio Armani in the stores and have paid the same price for half the volume (1.7 oz). This was a much better deal. I got twice as much and paid less. It is not a knock-off brand. It is the real deal. I was very happy with this purchase. The supplier shipped on-time what they promised and it arrived on time. Exactly what I wanted and expected.
"This is a great toy to have out during the holidays, the kids can actually touch it and play with it. It is a beautiful 'family oriented' set."
"I have tried many things to slow down my king charles vacuum cleaner, but this is the one that works best.Forget about placing the ball in the bowl or high bowls.When he's finished his dinner after using this bowl he doesn't look bloated like previously.Highly recommended."
"I thought this dewormer was in a pill form like Hartgard. You need to put it in pill form like you have for flea pills. Your flea pills you sell are outstanding, just stick the pill down the dogs throat and no more fleas!"
ASIN
"This product may work for hair growth on your head or brows, I don't know. It doesn't come in a large enough size to be used on your head though... You'd use a bottle each time. Anyway...I bought this hoping to use as an eyelash growth product since I'd read reviews elsewhere saying it regrows lashes. This is definitely NOT meant to be used near your eyes. It stings no matter how careful you are not to get it in them. I couldn't use it long enough to tell if it really works, it irritated my eyes so much."
"Charlie Brown's buddy PigPen would love this moisturizer's scent because IT SMELLS LIKE DIRT! I love the patchouli bath/shower gel because it does have a nice smell-LIKE PATCHOULI! This stuff, however, has the added bonus of hemp seed oil which probably gives it that ashtray full of marijuana roaches aroma. Well, I'm stuck with it and will continue to use it until I've become (hopefully) de-sensitized to it. In future, I'll just use Cetaphyl unscented lotion or cream after the patchouli shower gel."
"We bought this carrier for our mini Schnoodle, who was approximately 12 weeks old at the time. It seems to be well-made, sturdy; it's definitely attractive. (The flap on the top, providing additional access, is especially helpful.) And after shopping online, I discovered that it is very reasonably priced. I know there are more elaborate carriers available--hence four stars rather than five--but I would recommend this one without reservation."
This is one of the cutest products and my wife had to have for our twin daughters. It has been nothing but trouble. You have to place the TV in dvd mode for the dvd to run and so we have to set for the girls they cannot do on own. In addition it hangs up in the DVD start-up sometimes works others not (especially if they have had the tv on for a time). Remote is not balanced and is weighted on the oposite end of normal remotes so the girls got confused on which end to point to the tv. Also the weight of it made it difficult for them to hold in small hands.Except for how cute it is I would not buy again otherwise I would have given one star instead of two! Eventhough the unit is still working we are buying a different TV combo this week!
I was e-mailed a few days after placing the order and informed that it is out of stock. The site still lists it as in stock...don't believe them.
"This product was recommended by my vet when my persian developed arthritis in her hips. She improved markedly after a few weeks. I have been sprinkling it on her food for about a year now. She likes the taste as she is otherwise very picky. It is much cheaper online than at the vet, even with s&h."
This scent is awful! It smells like an old cat lady's house. Go with Egyptian Goddess scent made by this company.
"I bought ""Sydney"" for my 6 year old nephew for Christmas and was so impressed that I bought several more. Daniel loved them all, and they've become the toys he reaches for first. They make inexpensive shower gifts, too."
"Just opened the box today and was impressed with the quality of the contents. Tiles are easy to read for old eyes - not only large numbers, but also colors are good contrast, tiles are thick and substantial. Haven't played yet but I read quite a few of the questions and found myself laughing at a lot of them. Am looking forward to a great discussion with the question cards on an upcoming road trip."
"Not only did this combo not do anything to increase my rate of hair growth, but even as just a regular shampoo and conditioner, I didn't like how they made my hair feel or smell. After using these products, my hair felt waxy, and the stuff smelled like Nair (how ironic). Don't waste your money, I'm embarrassed that I fell for this."
"My son was so ecstatic when I gave him this. He hasn't let most of the toys out of his sight, he even sleeps with them. I've been looking for these everywhere, but in Canada they cost upwards of $35. For what Amazon was selling these for, I had to get it."
"My dog loves it and goes crazy for it! Also, other dogs (I was visiting my parent-in-law) went crazy for this treat. However, I must say this treat stinks so bad. You have to wash your hands after you touch them. =("
"I really like this shampoo and the smell is divine. It seems to add more shine and softness to my hair than the average grocery store shampoo, but not enough for the price. That is the reason I gave it 3 stars. The size is too small for the high price, and the performance isn't fantastic enough to make up for it. I'm going to try something else."
"This product says it is suitable for cats. My cat will not touch her food with this on it. The instructions say to put it in water, if they won't eat the food; that doesn't work for her either. Apparently it works best for dogs. I received it quickly, and the packaging was fine, I just cant use it!12/2008"
"I have been using Ponds dry skin cream since I was old enough to stand on a stool to reach the sink. I hated dirt, so I washed my hands and face 4-5 times a day with old Palmolive soap. Harsh, yes, and I did get chapped skin. I wanted to emulate my Gram, and she would smooth Ponds cold cream on her face then gently wipe it off. Then she would put Ponds dry skin cream on her face, and she had lovely skin until she died at age 98. I guess I inherited really wonderful skin from her.Since then, I have gone on to other moisturizers during the day, but at night I still stick with Ponds dry skin cream, especially after a good face wash. I do not wear any makeup so I do not have much to wash off, it is just a ritual. But the Ponds rich dry skin cream sinks right into my skin, it has kept it soft and supple and truly wrinkle free for many years, and you just can't beat the price for the amount you get.So I will continue my regimen, it works for me. Maybe this tried and true product will work for you."
"My 5-year-old son played with a Hover Copter at a friend's house and loved it so much I just had to get him one. Well, after reading the reviews here I was skeptical, but I went ahead and bought it anyway. I'm sure glad I did, 'cause it works just great and our son loves it. You charge it 10-15 minutes and then you can fly it 10-15 minutes. In our house, this cycle gets repeated over and over 'cause our son can't get enough! He likes to fly it up almost to the 2-story ceiling of our family room and down again. We haven't had any of the problems mentioned in the other reviews. Don't know if it makes a difference, but we have the 49MHz model."
I love this cologne. I had bought it for my husband when we were young teenagers dating-brings back those great memories. Smells great and sexy. It is my favorite cologne!
"My results aren't as pure as the one picture of the girl who dyed her whole head, but it is a bit darker than the other picture of the girl who did highlights.I bleached the ends of my hair (with the manic panic bleach) after parting it horizontally. This is the second time I've dyed it with this color and this time I left it in for 6 hours mixed with the L'Anza Trauma conditioner. The first time came out like a variegated sapphire/turquoise, now it is a bit heavier on the blue side. I'll try to take a picture of the result, but colors are so difficult to capture accurately!My next purchase will be the turquoise from this company and see if the two will play well together. My midlife color crisis seems to be expanding, I may look like a parrot by the time I'm 50.I'm very pleased with the initial color and the colors it turns as it fades, there's no awkward transitional color that looks like cat vomit.On that cheerful note, I'll attempt to post a picture of the fresh results."
"I bought the vsmile pocket for my 4 yr old. He loves it, but it seems to shut off quite often. I keep on having to change the batteries, and even with new ones it still just shuts off when hes playing.I would have to say don't buy it until they improve this product because as I can see I'm not the only one having this problem. I am going to try to return it.I have the bigger V smile that connects to the tv. that works great."
"My husband swore up and down that there was no demo for this toy, that it was just a dumb toy! It has been driving me nuts since my almost 4 year old got it for his 2nd birthday. I looked online, and saw that there is a plastic oval clear thing in the back. The demo mode was frustrating because my son missed half the alphabet and half his numbers, and the songs just changed constantly. I wonder if it had any effect on his brain really. I know it drove me nuts!"
"I have purchased the Blue Dog treats for my two Huskies, who absolutely LOVE them. While any treat is excitedly accepted, they are especially happy when I give them these particular cookies. Not that I can blame them; they smell good enough for humans! I also really like the fact that they are made in the US. My dogs do not get any stomach upset with Blue Dog, something I can no longer claim about Milk Bones. The monthly shipment, or in my case,6 week shipment, ensures that I won't run out, and the price buying in bulk makes these treats very affordable.Thanks Blue Dog, we love your company!"
This was a giftIt arrived the afternoonbefore the Big Family Gatheringand Mexican Train Domino NightThe whole group Loved the Train MarkersLots of different colorsto make everyone happy
"Bora Bora is by far one of the smoothest, long lasting men's fragrances that is not over powering but leaves everyone wondering who is wearing it and how can I keep experiencing it. Being a musician it really helps to have a cool scent on a smooth jazz set. If you are looking for a fresh and alluring scent Bora Bora is the one for you.Liz Claiborne COLOGNE SPRAY 1.7 OZ"
"Great doll for a child. It can get slobbered on and washed without any problems. I love the fact that it's not loaded with bad chemicals. My daughter loves to play with her doll. It will grow with her. Right now, she carries her around and feeds her cookies at her tea parties. Later, she will practice undressing and dressing the doll; then the hair will get attention. Educational, safe and fun. Love HABA stuff!"
We have 2 inside cats. They hate any flea treatment so Frontline gives us relatively easy to apply and effective flea control. I don't use it in the winter because I believe the chemicals are not good for them but will use it during the months when fleas are worst.
"I worked with a woman yesterday that was wearing this incredible perfume - WOW!! She smelled DELICIOUS & throught the day everyone kept complimenting her! Light, sensual, not too overwhelming, but definitely noticeable...not like anything I've worn before. I had to go out and buy some myself & just LOVE it!"
"The dinosaur was fun for my little guy, but the balls come flying out and go under coffee tables and furniture, so we are forever fetching them out of uncomfortable and dirty places. Works best in an enclosed environment."
"I've purchased a number of curling irons over the years, at various prices. The Conair Satin Finish 1-Inch Ceramic Curling Iron is a tremendous bargain. The ceramic finish allows me to put some strategic curl in my hair after blowing dry, without having my hair be damaged by sticking to the surface and overheating. The clamp holds securely enough to work on thin sections without slipping.This iron offers great convenience of use, safety features, and even imparts a wonderful shine to your hair. You can pay more for an iron, but it will be hard to match all these features at this great price, and I will definitely buy a second one in a different size."
"This is very poorly made. I wanted to get one from Amazon rather than one of the other merchants that sells through the website. They only had 6 choices, and I was liked that it folded so I chose this one.The holes are not completely drilled. The pegs do not fit properly into the recessed area that is supposed to hold them. The plastic cover for the peg compartment is very difficult to move. Even the card deck is slightly smaller than usual, but that doesn't really bother me since we have plenty of card decks. It is the shoddy construction of the board itself that is a disappointment. It was inexpensive, but it isn't worth anywhere near the price. It is more like something that you would find at one of the dollar or less stores.Cribbage itself is an excellent game, and a board makes a convenient way to keep track, but if you are looking at cribbage boards, you probably already know that."
"my three year old loves her new fisher price ""ipod"". She loves the pink color and can choose her favorite songs by the icon pictures(a great feature). My only complaint is that the volume at its highest level is still very low which makes it difficult for her to hear while riding in the car on the interstate while traveling."
"We purchased this product at Wal-Mart when our daughter was four-months-old, and we highly recommend it. We were tired of hand-cranking her mobile every five minutes and deliberated between the Flutterbye Dreams and Ocean Wonders, but chose this because of the ceiling projection.From the get-go, she began tracking the birdies on the ceiling and the music lulled her right to sleep. Shortly thereafter, we were in bed one morning and heard the music start through the baby monitor. Lo and behold, she had taught herself to use her foot to turn the item on and off! A few months later, she was on her belly, reaching up to operate it with her hand.She is now nine months old and loves it as much as the first day we bought it. What a wonderful item!"
"I purchased this item hoping to find something that would really help make the curls pop...it worked OK. The smell is pleasant and it doesn't leave the hair feeling sticky afterwards like a lot of other leave in products do. However, I didn't find anything too particularly special about this product at all and don't even get me started on the fact it's now $15.00 a bottle. For a small bottle at that! SO NOT WORTH IT! When I purchased it, it was $8.99, which is kind of ridiculous since I see a product very similar to it by Tresemme at Wal-Mart for like $3.99. I cannot believe they've almost tripled the price of this product in less than a month. I would save my money and go to Wal-Mart!"
"This game is a lot like Mastermind. It is fun and offers children a chance for deductive reasoning. There is an ""eyewitness"" who identifies if the ""detectives"" have spotted 1,2 or 3 of the suspects. The ""detectives"" need to use logical reasoning to deduce who the three suspects are on the card that the ""eyewitness"" is holding. My second grade twins love this game."
"The sticky tabs that came with the product doesnt work well. After a couple of rubs from my 16 LBS kitty, it was knocked off the wall. The product wasn't too solid, kinda flimsy, so the tabs couldn't hold it flat against the wall. I ended up buying super velcro tabs, which worked well, that is until kitty knocked it off, again. But it did last a couple of months this time. He likes it and uses it alot. If I didn't have to keep pinning it back on the wall, it could've gotten a 4 rating, and if it wasn't a flimsy rubber-plastic-like material, it would've gotten a 5. The catnips included doesn't do anything for kitty, and he's a catnip-junkie! I would say don't waste your time putting catnip in the groomer, just give it to him in a regular catnip toy, it didn't increase him using the groomer."
"This crate is very well built and was the exact size that I was looking for. I researched several crates at Pet Stores but they were very expensive. For the heck of it I searched online to see if I could find one cheaper. I saved $50.00 buy purchasing from Amazon. I was a little worried that with that kind of savings the crate may be cheaply made however I was pleasantly suprised when we put it together at how very sturdy the crate was. Excellent product, Excellent price."
"Before I purchase anything nowadays I check Amazon first. As always I'm glad I did. This is a great price for the product. As far as flea meds go, Advantage has successfully eliminated fleas on some occasions and reduced fleas in others. I have a few dogs which make controling fleas a bit more of a challange.Advantage always helps. One major plus, it did eliminate a minor tick problem I before it became a big issue."
"It took over a month to build up, but has certainly helped my dog with his hips. He's only 5 so I was surprised and concerned when he was having issues. But.. he's a Shepherd who are notorious for having bad hips. He's just about back to normal, but I think I need a bit more time to fully ascertain his progress. Either way, I recommend this product if your dog is having hip issues."
This is the only product that has helped my daughter's eczema. It is thick and the skin seems to stay softer longer once this cream is applied.
"I discovered Dunhill Man by walking into several Macy's in my area and asking the women behind the fragrance counter what their favorite fragrance was. Just about every one went straight to the Dunhill Man. It has a wonderful light scent that won't smell soapy or cheap. Two things I really like about the fragrance is 1) it smells really good to me 2) it smells really good to the women in my life. They like my other fragrances, but they request me to wear the Dunhill."
we have a 10 year old bishon frise and he has always had what i call black lava crusting around his eyes his previous owners tried everything the vet gave them and more to clear it up and nothing worked. so as a last ditch effort on my part i decided to try angel eyes. it took about a month to start seeing a difference but WOW what a difference it was no more black lava i can see his eyes and even his beard is coming in white. i would absolutely suggest this to anyone who's pet has a problem with stains or worse. just make sure to reorder before you run out i waited till i was out and had to wait a cpl of weeks and started to see the black coming back.
"I used to have one of these that was literally a towel, but shaped like this. When it began to fall apart (6 years later), i searched amazon to find a new one. I couldn't find one made of cotton, only these made of microfiber but decided to try it anyway. In short, these are extremely thin, and barely dry my very long (nearly 2 feet), thick hair. Although, it is nice and soft and dries fast. I'd recommend for anyone with thin or short hair, or I'd recommend first towel drying as much as possible with a normal bath towel, and securing in this to get ready."
"My Maltese loves to play with this. He is occupied for quite some time, pulling out the small toys. I sometimes also put a treat toy in as well, just to give some additional variety. He has not chewed up the small toys. He loves to run with the beehive over his head. I got the smaller size and it is ideal for him. He weighs about ten pounds. The holes are small enough so that he does not get his head caught in the toy."
"My cocker spaniel loves this chew so much that there's no hope that I'll ever get to throw it away. It's been chewed up so much that it's almost not recognizable. It has reduced his need to chew one rawhide bone a day, but I'm a bit uneasy about allowing him to chew this much longer.He's had it for over 2 weeks now. When I first rec'd it, I also noticed that it was made in China, so I checked all the pet recall lists to ensure it was safe. There was no mention of this bone being part of the wheat glutin problem, so I gave it to him. Every responsible dog owner needs to be aware of the recalls (btw) before handing over toys, treats and food to their pets. I'm going to have to wait for my cocker to ""look the other way"" so I can replace this with a new Hartz Chew N' Clean. :-)"
"This is such a cute toy to look at but it is too sensitive! It plays songs and talks but as soon as it is touched in any way, the toy moves onto another song or pre-recorded phrase. It is really annoying how it doesn't complete a song if it is touched in any way and with a baby who reaches and grabs, the toy is always skipping to something else and not finishing a song."
"This product works ok... but when I use it, it hurts my eyes because it presses on them a little too much. Also the velcro backing is annoying when sleeping on your back, because it will get caught on the pillow if you move your head around."
ROYAL SECRET - COLOGNE SPRAY 1.7 OZ [Health and Beauty]Product was what I was looking for. Have not been able to purchase this for a number of years. I am so glad it is back on the market. I hope the price remains as reasonable as what I paid on Amazon.Lovely fragrance.
I got this for my 2yr old son and thought it might be a little 'too babyish' for him....but he loves it. We put it in his crib last night and I rocked him while the music played softly in the background for about 10 mins and he was fast asleep. When I went to get him out of the crib this morning he was holding the toy and had to get it out too...he's been carrying it around and playing with the remote too. I really wish I would have had this when my boys were babies....very neat little lullaby toy. The remote works great and you can adjust the volume (which many toys don't allow). I got it for $9.99...probably wouldn't pay much over that.
Nice sharp clippers for my cat. They cut straight through and do not break this claws. Very easy to operated with one hand while holding down my cat. They lock closed when not in use. The safety plate makes sure you do not cut too much. Be careful when clipping the same claw twice or you might cut too much. Very durable and blade seems like it will last a long time.
"This product is not as advertised at all. As another reviewer pointed out, it is loaded with sulfates and no different from any drug store shampoo. Personally, I've found that this shampoo actually has a drying effect on my hair. That's why you need all the other products; the heavy conditioner plus the leave-in conditioner. The other products just coat the hair with silicones, again, the same as drug store products. I also found this product incredibly stripping- my colored hair was bright orange after two weeks (washing every other day) with this product."
I just received my stickers and when placed on a CLEAN WINDOW they fall right off. I can't get them to stay. Not only do they not work I paid twice as much for the shipping as I did for the sticker's (2) I guess I should have read the feedback first.. Now I need to order from a different vendor! Bad product :(
This product was recommended to me by my vet several years ago. It seems to draw my cat to his litter box. It is easy to use - just sprinkle it in with the cat litter. It works!
"Art Asylum basically shrunk Nimoy for this toy; the likeness is amazingly strong, especially at this scale. Probably the best figure they've ever done in their Trek line. Recommended for even a casual fan of Trek or toy collector. If you only buy one Art Asylum Trek figure, make it this one."
"I have medium to light brown hair naturally, but have been dyeing it at home for several years. I usually use a dark ash blonde shade, and my hair usually ends up a golden blonde with lots of red/orange tones. I decided to try L'Oreal Preference 8 1/2A Champagne Blonde and use the Ardell. It turned the dye a dark purple/black like the other reviews mentioned, and I only used 5 drops, which is much less than they say to use. I could tell a difference as soon as my hair dried- my hair was lighter than I've ever been able to take it, but instead of seeing more orange or red, I saw much less- I look closer to a blonde instead of a strawberry blonde. I have also mixed some into my conditioner and used it that way. Next time, I'll be adding the recommended amount to the hair dye. I'm really impressed that a cheaper product like this can get me close to the hair color I've been wanting for years."
"My beagle puppy loves these treats. He doesn't particularly cares for his crate but he goes right in it when he comes from outside because he knows he is going to get this treat. I only feed him natural foods that have no by products, so this products fits the bill. It doesn't smell bad either. I plan to buy more of this for him in the future."
"I've been using this bowl for a few months now, for our cat who has a tendency to eat too fast. It has worked wonders for us, we no longer find food thrown up on the floor! We actually went on vacation for a few days, and pulled out a normal bowl so we could fill it up with food... and back to the throw-up. I would 100% recommend this bowl for those of you who have cats with a tendency to eat too fast and regret it later!"
"This fox lasts pretty long with my dog, but maybe because she's not crazy about it. Not extremely fun, the squeaker doesn't work too well."
"First of all, Amazon has this product listed as ""Well Water Action"" but the product that I received is ""Hard Water Wellness."" At the time, the product photo did not match the description, but I bought it anyway, and now I see that Amazon has changed the photo to match the description, so you might actually receive a different product. Or perhaps the manufacturer has simply changed the name of the shampoo.Anyway, I have had limited success with this shampoo mostly because my particular well water does not work well with detergents. It is very high in manganese but low in iron, making it very difficult for any existing filtration system to remove the manganese because most filters depend on bonding the manganese to the iron in order to remove it. On top of that, our water is very soft (water hardness is not an indicator of all mineral content, but of calcium content only) so any type of water softening does not help me. My hair suffered greatly before we discovered what the problem was -- our water, instead of the shampoo/curling iron/hair dryer, which I kept thinking it was -- but once I began rinsing my hair with vinegar in the rinse water it improved greatly, and even more so when I began the ""no 'poo"" baking soda plus vinegar regimen. I bought this shampoo because it is not always convenient for me to use the baking soda, and sometimes I just want to wash my hair like a ""normal"" person. I can't really use it more than a few days in a row because it does build up on my hair, but at least the build up is not nearly as bad as it is with a regular SLS shampoo. I also wash my 5 year old daughter's hair with it because it is tedious to use baking soda and vinegar on her hair, and it doesn't seem to build up and break her hair off as bad as traditional shampoo either, but we don't wash her hair every day (while I do wash mine every day). Bottom line, if you have well water with a high mineral content, I think it is worth the six bucks to try this stuff and see how it will do with your hair and your water. Plus, it smells really great. Especially compared to vinegar."
"I wish I would have read some of the negative reviews more thoroughly. Lesson learned? Never buy perfume without smelling, even if it has good reviews. I think this could be named ""Vanilla Musk."" The shipping was very quick, so I have only good things to say there, but this scent was nothing fabulous to me. Too sweet and too musky. The prices on Amazon are fabulous, but I'd still recommend smelling it somewhere if you can. If nothing else, there is a small roll-on for a fraction of the cost that may be a good way to test it out. Good luck!****Edited"
"I picked up a huge 5oz can of these kookamunga catnip treats (chicken flavor) since my cats love treats, and they love catnip.Well, my cats who will normally eat any treats I give them have avoided these like they were made of pooh. :)I even put some outside for the neighborhood cats who normally come running whenever I put special treats out. So far, no takers. Not even the raccoons seem interested and they've been known to swipe the cat food I put out.Even the neighborhood dogs who will gobble up anything without even tasting it won't touch these things.While I'm on the subject, I also picked up some catnip in a tub to give my cats and they won't eat that either. Maybe there's just something about the catnip they use in their products that is turning my cats into catnip snobs.Anyway, if you're going to buy this to try out, get as small a container as possible to make sure your cats actually like it. Don't do what I did and buy a huge thing only to find out your cats won't eat it."
I have two long haired Maine Coon cats. Shedding had been a problem all summer. It took 3 days of combing each day to take out all the loose hair on the cats (piles of it). Since then I just comb them once a week and have not had any hair around the house.
"We use this bag every time we travel, to bring our 9 pound Chihuahua on the plane with us.It fits snugly under the seat in front of us, and our dog just goes to sleep for the durationof the flight.We keep her leash and a small water dish in the compartment on the Sherpa, very handy."
I got these as a gift for a friend who I know tried Mexican Train and loved it. I got her this version and she's been playing it all the time! The case snaps shut and holds together well and the dominoes are nicely made. Great set!
"THE CARDS HAVE BEEN A STANDARD FOR ME FOR MANY YEARS, AND I'M NEVER DISAPPOINTED."
"I've used this and it worked pretty well with my Havanese dog. I just purchased more from my vet ($38.43 for 12 packs!!!). I'll never buy it from my vet again, it is 1/3rd the price on Amazon.Another vet recommend using 'Adolph's Unseasoned Tenderizer (without MSG)' instead of For-Bid. Certainly it is a lot cheaper (and has other uses), but I have not yet tried it. I do plan to use it in the future though, if problems remain.R"
"I got this toy as a gift for my 1 year old daughter,she enjoyed a lot .Now my son is 9 months old,I gave the old one in charity when my daughter turns 3,n looking for the same toy in stores.I bought couple of other toys with the same theme,ie music n balls,but nothing worked i returned those.This one is the best n I will definately get one for my son."
"Some reviewers here are complaining about how these aren't as good as the 8x6 ""original"" wipes. While these are indeed more paper-like in feel (and a bit drippy) and not cloth-like like the originals, it still gets the job done with the same efficacy. With the same active ingredient of 62% Ethy Alcohol in all of Purell's products, it disinfects exactly the same. I bought these 7x5 wipes somewhere else at about 1/4 of the price of the more expensive top-selling 8x6 original wipes here on Amazon. For me, I just need to disinfect my hands, and my work surface occasionally, so these just get the job done. They even come in individually packaged tiny 2"" packs for greater portability to boot."
"Not much more to add since this has a lot of well earned good reviews. I like the safety feature--a little ""flap"" that swings over the non-cutting side of the blades to make sure you only take off a bit at a time.Just squeeze firmly and quickly and you won't have any issues with twisting your dogs nail/toe...."
"This toy is one of the rarest in the series so far. If you can stand the temptation to open, I recommend leaving in the box. If you find great toy to buy. Also Yoda and Dooku are rare."
"This toy turned out to be so noisy that I never gave it to my child. It went straight in the attic. Frankly I was concerned it could damage my 10 month old daughter's hearing.It says that it is for children of all ages, well certainly not for babies and toddlers who have their toys up close (even licking them) all the time. Perhaps when she is 3-4 years old, but certainly not now.Why on earth did the manufacturer not put a simple little button on it to control the volume? I think this could have been a great toy, but as it is now it's useless."
"I bought one of these for my 17 yr. old granddaughter and now I've purchased two more for her sisters. With three teenagers getting ready at the same time, and fighting over this particular one, the other two are getting one for Christmas. They love it!"
Holiday gift for my boyfriend who has used this cologne for many years. He said it was as it was supposed to be (not tampered with or anything as I've read in some reviews)
I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it. She's even gotten Daddy and Grandpa to dress-up :) Very cute game!!!
"The Legendary Riders figures, coming between and during a run of pretty awesome build a figure sets as they did, didn't really spark my imagination personally. However, I did get the pretty cool Wolverine figure with motorcycle and finally after staring me down several times while I was in the store the Fantastic Four's Thing finally made it home with me.As a depiction of the Thing from the origin of the team it is pretty spot on. His rocky (Cap 'n Crunchy?) exterior looks good and the paint really makes it look like hard rock, which is good since that's all he's got as his uniform consists of his blue underwear. He does have a semi-constipated grimace on his face but its not really that bad. He has good articulation, elbows, knees, wrists, fingers, neck, ankles and so on.Now, the Wolverine has a cool motorcycle so is Thing's transportation just as cool? Ah, heh heh, nope. It's a Fantastiscooter or basically a hovering moped and to be honest he just looks silly sitting on it as he's so big and the scooter looks so effeminate. I'll keep it in case I get an Invisible Woman or Mr. Fantastic who might not look so silly on it.So good figure overall. Just forget about the scooter."
Santa brought this item. We opened it several days later and it broke the same day.
there is nothing in the market that can come close to this product!!!!!Been using Neutrogena body oil for over 50 years-----it keeps my skin from being dry or flacky without an oily residue.
I bought this because I saw so many good reviews on this site.I am on my second bottle and haven't seen much difference yet.
"i was extremely excited to see this at my local toys r us because i know this has been discontinued for a good while now. they had 3 at my store but 2 of them weren't in that great of a shape. the water levels on the other 2 were only halfway or less of the way. i was lucky enough to score one w/ full water. unfortunately tho some idiot bought it before i did and didn't read directions and cut off the belt that you attach it to the crib. but it's ok i bought it anyways because i wanted it really bad after reading the reviews here online and [...]. there is a clicking sound tho when either the fish or the sea weed moves but it doesn't seem to bother my kids much. i had bought this for my upcoming 4th baby. only 7 months right now so i haven't tested it on the baby or how he'll like it but my 3 kids 4-9 uses it at night and they seem to love it and it seems to help them go to sleep. i love the control. because when it stops the music and they're still awake all they have to do is press the control instead of getting up from bed. since the belt on mine was broken i lay it on a chair where they can all see it. the thing is pretty sensitive tho because when i brought it in my room to test it out it kept turning on and off when i would use the tv control. so if you don't have a control for this or if you lost it you can always use your regular tv control. it can get annoying tho if you don't mean to turn it on and your just flipping thru channels or lowing the volume of the tv. seems any button works to turn this thing on and off. one of the blue lights (there's 3) is out...but i bought it that way. i love it so much i kept it anyway. and if the clicking noises bothers (which it doesn't for my kids), i could always turn off the motion and just turn on the lights and music. great toy. too bad they discontinued it. hopefully my water level wont lessen."
"It was definitly not what i expected, but once I started playing and trying to become the most powerful I quickly got addicted to it. I recomend it to anyone who likes strategy yet simple (not to simple though)."
I ordered this bed for our 80lb lab and once it was out of the box it was together in no time and our dog was more than pleased. This is so much better than all those stuffing beds we have bought it gets him off the floor/ground and when I want to clean it I will just hose it off!!
"This product is amazing!! My 15 year old cat Tony has been in renal failure for quite awhile and was showing all the serious signs; losing weight and his appetite, becoming lethargic and becoming withdrawn. I started him on these vitamins and within a few days he was hungry, bright eyed, jumping on tables and telling me when it was time to eat. I am so thankful I found this."
"This toy has many different aspects to it. It has items on it that spin. It has items to press that make noises, and generally is very entertaining to our 9 month old granddaughter."
"Used it for bed bugs. Kills them on contact, but you will need more than just this spray to exterminate. Use the spray on your mattress and night stand and book cases. Even check behind paintings and wall hangings. No mercy! You need an arsenal supply of toxic gasses to defeat the bed bug zombie force. Best of luck."
"If you enjoy RISK, and are a LOTR fan, then you will love this game. Great board, wonderful graphics, and nice pieces (very intricate for such a massed produced game.) The basic rules are much the same as RISK, but with several twists that definitely give the game a LOTR flair. I particularly like how the One Ring moves along the board, following the same path Frodo and Sam take in the movie. Another nice feature, that separates this game from the original RISK game, is the fact that there are several ""strongholds"" that give an advantage to either the dark forces or the free peoples depending on the geographic location of the stronghold. Also there are ""leaders"" that can lend strategic advantages when attacking or defending in battle. Now about the seller"
"I have smelled this cologne before and this is nothing like it. It has a very moldy odor, no scent of anything but that moldy odor. It also feels oily on my skin. I wore this to a dinner event and a friend of mine told me I smelled like grease.I'm disappointed as I just ordered more fragrances from amazon, and they don't allow returns... I'm going to stick to department stores now, it's pricey but at least you know what your getting*UPDATE*Amazon was kind enough to refund my purchase order. Great Service! Still not gonna take another chance with this fragrance but my ck fragrance smelled great from amazon.. Just luck i guess."
"This was too expensive for what i received... just the deck of cards, instructions, and a box.... better to buy just the deck of cards. This is a great game... but not worth the 30 dollars i spent on it and shipping. I am very disappointed in the marketing of this on Amazon... makes we leery of using Amazon next time."
This little door works well. Easy to install and provides a great way for the cat to enter/leave the house. It has a small magnet on the bottom of the door that will keep the door closed after the cat uses the door. Highly recommend this animal door for small pets.
"I just got a small dog after falling in love with my friend's small dog of the same breed. My friend trained her dog on puppy pads, and had a plastic frame that held the pad in place. I couldn't find her particular frame in a store here in California, so purchased this frame. The problem with this one is that you have to take four pieces apart EVERY time you replace the pad and then put the entire frame back together. It's a major pain. I ended up buying a second frame from Amazon.com (via KV Vet Supply) by ""Nothing Like It"" Designs. The top frame piece is a single piece, and picks up easily when you have to change pads. I like the single piece frame so much better!"
"I searched for the very best gift for my sister's first grandson, and this is what I picked. He loves it. She said he plays with it for at least an hour every day. He looks for it as soon as he gets up. He's 18 months old and this will stimulate his imagination. He can pretend it's whatever he wants. You'll see this in many doctors offices, and some kid is always playing with it. The last time we went to the dentist, 2 of my granchildren headed right for this (ages 10 & 12). I'll have to admit the 16 year old wasn't interested. We actually got two toys in one, after he finishes playing with the toy, he plays in the box. 4/13/09 My sister said he still loves this toy. He spends on average an hour a day playing with it. To keep his interest she puts it away occasionally for a week or two, and whan she takes it back out he is happy to see it back."
"Our students, ages 3-5, love this table! It can be used for water and sand, of course, but we also use it for ooblick (that wonderful combination of corn starch and water for sensory play), and we shred tissue paper and 'hide' items in it that link with the lesson (currently, plastic frogs of all sorts, colors, and sizes are hidden in various shades of green tissue paper). The children use 'chop sticks' to locate and pluck them out of the bin, assisting with the strengthening of fine motor muscles. It requires minimal space, drains water simply, and easily moves from room to room on sturdy wheels. This was a purchase that will provide many enriching activities for our students!Connie Kerr VogtAdministratorSouth Hills Child Development Center Incwww.shills.info"
"This amazing game/learning tool is frustrating in the beginning, however, it teaches your child how to be more accurate in his or her writing. my son isn't the brightest crayon in the box nor the quickest, but he has excelled with this game. He volentarily writes his abc's on his magnet drawing toy in the car after this game. his drawing has become more elaborate, and his comprehension of instruction has excelled. He can navigate through the menus easily and the options throughout keep him totally entertained. I highly reccomend this toy."
"IT WORKS PERFECTLY, IT IS DURABLE AND IT PREVENTS THE ROOM FROM SMELLING LIKE DOG FOOD. I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYBODY!!!"
"My son got this as a gift when he was 8 months. He immediately figured out how to put the balls in the basket. I do wish they came out the front, because he doesn't see where they went, so we always have to give them back to him. He is also figuring out to push the nose for music, and he loves riding on it while we wheel him around. I don't think it will work very well as a walker, though - it seems restricting for his legs. Also, it's kind of complicated (for me anyway!) to switch it from a rider to a walker, so I think we'll just keep it as a rider and get a different walker. I really love the size of the balls - they are perfect for his little hands, and he likes to throw them to us like a baseball."
"This is my second order (I ordered Eau de Cartier Concentree)and both times I have been very pleased by both your professionality and speed. The order arrived when agreed and in perfect condition. Overall, I have nothing to complain about and will certainly do business with you again.Jasna Juranic"
"I paid $70 for the DermaNew microdermabrasion system at home, and after using it for a couple of times I can honestly say that is not worth the money. You can accomplish the same results you get with this system, by using any other cheaper system for sale out there, like Neutrogena or simply rubbing oatmeal on your face!On top of that, you CANNOT find the replacement foam applicators for the face by themselves, the company discontinued the sale of applicators alone!???. Isn't this ridiculous? The only face applicator available comes as a set with a body applicator and a brush which you never really use and have no need to buy them again and will cost you another $15 for cheaply made products that disintegrate after 3-4 uses."
"My girls love this game and I love it on the days when it's too cold to go outside and they are a bit on edge. They can get outr their aggression. . .so to speak. . .and have fun playing the game. If my kids were more aggressive and hit each other, then it wouldn't be a good fit for our family. They are such good kids, so it's not an issue."
This was bought to give as a gift and will be given next week. I am not familiar with the product but understand that it is a favorite of the recipient. I did smell it and thought it was wonderful.
"I love this cream - it's great for the price, non-greasy, very moisturizing. I also love the foot cream they make."
Good construction. Can put any toy in it. I suggest adding many toys. I think the younger or more playful cats would like. My cats would not play with it unless I sat down and moved the toys around.
"My 9 year old daughter wanted this game for Christmas, and being a huge fan of *nsync and loving board games, I thought this would be a lot of fun for her, and it really is! Although some of the trivia fact answers are different from what we have read elsewhere, the game does not take long to play and is a blast for anyone who loves these guys!! We highly recommend it!!"
My 9 month old loves this toy and I see him playing with this for many months.
"My Goldens loved the bed and have to fight the cats and rabbit for lounging time.It does look like it will be a pain to put the cover back on after cleaning. For the price compared to what I saw at the big pet stores, this one is great and the four legged family members are thrilled."
"I got this item for my 3-year old nephew two years ago at Christmas when the toy first hit the shelves at the toy store. A year later, my sister told me he loved it and still plays with it a whole year later. I also saw reviews listing it as one of the best toys for toddlers in the last 5 years. I want to buy it for my little boy now."
My daughter got this because we hit a Vtech toy sale and this looked great. She hardly ever plays with it though. I thought she might grow into it and she is now 2 1/2 and still ignores it. I think it frustrated her that the cord is way too short and that it topples when it is pulled. Just not as fun as other phones that I have seen.
Conair Quick Wrap is easy to use! It is the BEST hair product out there! Great for gifts because the price is right. Easy to refill with any string from local hobby store. I could not believe how great this product works after purchasing many other hair products that were hard to use. It wraps long hair in two minutes! It's a must buy!
"We got this for my son's 6th birthday. As a 3 1/2 year veteran of constructing power rangers, we figured he was certainly up to the task with this. After 20 minutes of trying to decipher the ""instructions"" and watching the trailer collapse every time we tried to get it to stand to make the ""superrobot"", my son dissolved into tears and I was ready to throw this dumb thing across the room. Needless to say, it is going back TODAY and my son has been promised his choice of any other kind of toy EXCEPT a transformer. Big mistake. Never again. Unless your child is a budding rocket scientist or NASA engineer, save your money. Better yet, have your child re-design the instructions so a college-educated adult as well as a law school graduate can understand them."
I simply dissolved one pill and let my cat's food absorb the medicine. She ate it right up and no longer has worms. I'm very pleased that I'm not going to be forced to pay a $150 vet bill. A week after the medicine was administered her coat/attitude/and weight are all much better. This is something every pet owner should have.
"I have never given such high marks for any toy, but this is a great one for all my kids who range from 9 months to 3-1/2.This toy is all I expected and more. You don't have to hit the drum very hard to get it to do things and there are two on/off switches so you don't have to run low on batteries by forgetting to turn it off.If you buy nothing else for your child, go for this one."
"I bought this game for my son. I am very dissappointed in it. It is too hard for a child to play. Heck, I have a hard time with it. I love VSMILE and all the games but this one."
"I started wearing this perfume back in my high school days, and even then the smell would fit for a teenager. And now that I am in my mid thirties, this smell also fits women my age. Really, this product is ageless (both in value and in market age range)"
"I have been using this product for about 3 weeks. (Twice a day). It has definitely lightened the dark circles and inner eye darkness. I think it may take 4 to 6 weeks to comepletely lighten, but I am satisfied with the results so far. I would definitely recommend it to anyone with this problem."
"Back in unicron.com, we thought that Leobreaker is awesome. Well, he is! He's very mighty since he was still Overhaul with the awesome claws and yet bad arms. He is still cool. The lion mode was a nice touch. Even he combines with Optimus Prime. Looks great to me. And you can buy him too, because the clerk will notice. Even though he is $20.00, you can still buy him! And his tail is used for a battle axe. SWEEEEEET!!!!!!!!!!! And the best part is he can be turned into a weapon so OP will hold both weapons. Now that's the Ultimate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah!! Well, if you were a smart hombre, then you'd know Leobreaker is the coolest!!!!! Besides Overhaul and the new Brushguard. I bet his toy is beautiful. Good thing I rated 5 stars. Yep. 5 out of 5. And none of his parts fall when you leave home. And you can never leave home without it. Ah, just when Mudflap was an Autobot and then he is a Decepticon. But he cares about Prime and hates Megs. And Evac, he doesn't look doctorey like Red Alert, but he transforms into a rescue helicopter. Wait, where's Red Alert?! There's an upgrade of him in the ultra class which was Galaxy Force FirstGunner. There are other upgrades like Hot Shot and Scattorshot. And Leobreaker is the upgrade of Overhaul. The reason why he did this is because he wanted to be in the Jungle Planet, but doesn't have a beast mode. And that's why he became GF Ligerjack. What a potassium. He's still awesome, no doubt. I hope you highly recommend this toy. And besides, upgrades don't make the figure that special, by the way."
"An easy high protein snack that my dogs love. I am not sure about the fat content, but I give them alone in the a.m. as their ""meal"", and feed them dinner at night."
Great amount of window space for the dog to look out and for us to keep an eye on her. Most of the other tents we looked at don't give the dog an enough air flow while this one is almost all windows. We use this with the air conditioning on in hotels while traveling being careful there's no way she can over heat. The tent feels very sturdy but make sure your dog is crate trained in a normal crate before trying something like this out.
"I received this product free from Bzz Agent to try along with the Sensitive Skin Moisturizer. I have loved using both products. My skin is prone to breaking out in pimples and red spots due to allergies or stress. Since I started using the facial cleanser, along with the moisturizer, I have noticed a big improvement in my complexion. After using the products for a month my skin in completely clear or red spots and blemishes. The cleanser itself took a little getting used to. It doesn't lather up like most cleansers I have used, but my face does feel cleaner after using it. Also, it smells a bit like raw pizza dough to me which is a bit odd, but I've gotten used to it and it doesn't bother me so much any more. I will definitely be buyng the facial cleanser in the future, and I have recommended it to family members with sensitive skin as well."
this was rated number 1 by scientists who tested 20 different sunblocks. apply every two hours especially if you perspire and after swimming.
"This is the best handcream available, pricey, but a life saver if you have painfully cracked and dry skin."
Being able to purchase a 50# bag of dogfood from Amazon is worth it's weight in gold. Not having to lug it out of the store it great! The bag was in perfect condition when it got to us.
"I had the hardest time trying to install the batteries, something that should have taken all of 2 minutes, took me about 20. I couldn't get the cover back on without it springing back up. I broke two of the holding tabs trying to get the cover to fit back on and then lock it. I finally was able to get the cover on, but since two tabs were broken during this process, the cover doesn't sit flat. I have it secured with a rubber band, but the light works. I don't blame the seller for this problem, but the manufacturer"
"Prefer these because there's no perfume, purely functional lotion that doesn't cause breakouts."
"The box works ok. I can't understand why there's not a way to make the box run manually. That means if your cat makes a huge stink in the box, you have to wait 15-20 minutes for the box to run. Even unplugging it and plugging it in doesn't make it run. Bags have gotten caught in the mechanism as well, even when we've been very careful. No one can seem to get the automated litter box right."
"We've been playing this game for years. It's a great equalizer for all ages to play together, We take it camping, to our cabin, to the beach. Fun for young and old."
"This is a good sunscreen that truly works. But it leaves a light pale color on your face - like an unmatched foundation. If the color matches your skin color that is good. If it does not, it looks like a bad foundation.You may consider diluting and applying - dont know if that would affect the sunscreening ability."
"This product includes 30 small pick-up sticks - an embarrassingly small bundle. They are made of plastic, and each has a pronounced seam along the edge, which affects gameplay. Please, don't waste your time and money. Look elsewhere for a decent product."
"One of my favorite scents. Those who enjoy cool, fruity scents will really enjoy this fragrance. The scent of green apple is very evident in the fragrance without being overbearing, and it mixes very well with body chemistry--at least, it did for me. I'm a perfume-aholic, and this lasted me almost one year. The fragrance is very playful, has great staying power, and is suitable for any age. I can't tell you how many friends and coworkers stopped just to sniff me when I wore this, as creepy as that sounds. Very worth the money.Similar to"
"Both nephews, and both my kids, all different ages, were wild about these."
"We are longtime customers of Newman's Own Organics Dog Treats. We have an 11-year old cockapoo and a 10-year old miniature schnauzer who already enjoy thechickenandcheesevarieties of Newman's Own Organics Dog Treats for Small Sized Dogs, using the Amazon Subscribe & Save program.Thesesalmon and sweet potatotreats are slightly larger, although the heart-shaped treats are designed to be easily breakable for smaller dogs.Here's the list of organic ingredients"
"The product looks like an original, it smells good, but it does not last long ! I get complements from friends."
Love the whole Lupine line - best out there - highly recommend - I've been in the animal biz for well over 20 years - the only one we use!!
My dog loves the taste of this toothpaste and is acutally excited about having his teeth brushed. I do not have to fight him at all. When I whip it out he comes right into the bathroom to have his teeth brushed.
"The cobra throne is an awesome accessory, as well as the flags. The only thing that would have made this set better would have been the inclusion of more weapons for the imperial guards."
"Too small, too expensive and misrepresented by Amazon. Please respond to me directly if you are really concerned. I doubt I will get any kind of answer."
"1. I was charged for this product immediately, then emailed that it was backordered. It did finally arrive, took about 3 weeks total.2. It WORKS. I have 2 children, a boy almost 5, and a girl almost 7. He has been biting for a few months, she for probably a year. They both had absolutely NO nails left and also were biting the skin around the nail. I would tell them to stop when watching tv, etc, but could not stop them while they were at school, etc.3. It WORKS! They actually have nails! I put it on Wednesday afternoon for the first time. I reapplied inconsistently (it does wear off) - you could reapply twice a day or every couple days, depending on how much you need. By Monday afternoon, I could see decent nail growth on both children. My son did try to bite (more than my daughter) - and would then go get a drink to wash the taste out. It does taste very bad - not enough to make you sick, but enough to make you stop biting and help remember not to bite next time. I think the habit is broken, but I will keep it on them for a week or so now to make sure!Also, there are a couple different listings on Amazon for this same product."
"I bought this for my seven year old niece for Christmas, and we were both very disappointed. The dancing portion was very tough to follow. The Pinball game was the only one that we had success with, and she was bored with that within minutes. This is a purchase I regret."
"these are great.. my dog likes ! at first he didn't like, but now he enjoys them. I recommend.yum yum yum for little dogs"
"For anyone who hasn't played it yet, i suggest you do. It's a very fun game that also uses strategy, which should leave parents and children grinning in delight. If you ever doubt your skill as a duelist, or if you're in a duel and losing, then just do one thing"
"They should have shown strips of what the color would have looked like on certain colors of natural hair, just as they do on their color wheels, in stores, or at the very least, as the company shows on the side of their packages. BUT L'Oreal Hair Color has been my choice to take a bit of the summer red out of medium brown long hair, SINCE I WAS 14 and my ""Grand Mere"" told me that only slatterns and women of the evening had MY color before I colored it. Also, coloring in the darker shades, uses only 20 volume creme activator, which make thin hair coated with color, shine, and gives it volume. COLOR YOUR HAIR A DARKER SHADE FOR SHINE!"
I got this as a Christmas present for my 21 month old and he LOVES it!! It is very durable and can be played with in stationary mode or make it move in circles or in a line. The music is pleasant and not too loud. I highly recommend this for toddlers!
"We played already a few times, and we are playing all together, which was not the case before. Husband, kids and me we all like to play.And it reinforces math skill...."
"although not much of a challenge, this game is very addicting! The only drawback is the screen, it is very dim and hard to see. You have to move it around to get the right angle to see it. I definitely like the online game better, but when you have to be away from your PC and you need to play Slingo this does the trick!"
"I read reviews of both this and the Leap pad system before purchasing one. I chose the PowerTouch mostly because you don't need a pen for it. My daughter got it for her 2nd birthday in June and hasn't gotten bored with it yet. It doesn't have as many books as the LeapPad, but that hasn't been a problem with us because there is so much to do in each book. The age recommendation says 3 yrs +, but at 2 my daughter loves it. Only complaint, my daughter was able to rip some pages out of the book, but she was being very rough with them, the pages still work if you put them in the right order on the system though :) I recommend this to everyone I know who has a little one."
"I had my original Caruso steam unit, the one where you add salt, for 3 years, now I can't get through 3 weeks without it blowing some fuse or something. As much as I love the steam system I'm giving up. Kris"
"This will be the 6th time I've bought this particular model of blow dryer. With the newer models putting out 1750 - 2000 watts, the 1600 watts of drying and heat is good for trying to control and manage really curly hair. Too much air, too fast is not a good thing when you're trying to blow it straight.This dryer is not too big, not too small, good price, lasts for a year at least, and is easy to handle. I'll keep buying it as I have found anything that works any better."
This toy is awesome!!! My mom got it for me the other day and i loved it. My dogs almost got hold of it and even when they did i had no bite marks at all!!! I love this toy and it is the best ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I have several perfumes that I wear through the week but Opium is the only one that brings me compliments every single time I wear it. Just this morning the young man at McDonald's said ""you smell really good"" as I paid for my large cup of black coffee. I'm 52 so any compliments from young men are extra special!!!Opium smells different on everyone but I feel sexy, youthful, and beautiful when I wear it. I highly recommend this wonderfully aromatic perfume!"
"Extremely happy with this pet door. It fits in the wall instead of the door. Has two heavy duty plastic flaps to keep out weather and bugs. We close it up when we go to bed to keep out squirrels and racoons. Dogs love it, too. If we need another one, this is the one we'll buy. Got a great price for it, too. Less than what is listed."
"We currently have four always indoors cats, we have had as many as six at one time. We have owned as many as two Litter Maids at one time and experienced the same problem with all of them. First the solid waste sticks to the forks and is difficult to clean. Second the trays are expensive and messy to change. I see where they are now giving you 18 trays for about the same price we were paying for twelve, but at over $1.00 each they are still too much.We recently bought a Scoop Free and are more than happy with it. It works as advertised and even though the replacement cartridges are expensive, they last a long time and actually cost us less than we were paying for litter alone. We have now bought a second Scoop Free and find we only use three cartridges a month, and have never had to clean it except for waste that has gotten on the sides that needs to be wiped off, but we would have that problem no matter what type of box we used.If you are thinking about buying an automatic litter box I would suggest you buy the Scoop Free instead of this one. With the ninety-day money-back guarantee you have nothing to loose and I believe you will not want to return it.See my full review of the Scoop Free by going to the product or my clicking on ""See all of my review"" link here."
This Star Wars character is a cool addition to any Star Wars collection. It holds up to all the play time it's sure to get.
"what a find! bought this for my 4 year old for Christmas and we all love it. No batteries, no parts to lose, simply open the crocs mouth and push teeth down til you hit the ""sore"" one and he chomps down. My kids think it is hilarious. Also doubles as a really cute animal toy and a great travel toy. Recommend for all households with small children."
"I use Excellence in 9.5N. I was so happy that this root touch up worked so well. It matched perfectly. I have a few grays, so I left it on for 15 minutes. I guess this is high lifting, because it works so quickly. All in all, this product is saving my hair because I truly do wait almost six weeks now to redye my hair. Bravo, Clairol!"
Look through these reviews for the video of someone's cat moving the mechanism inside to get food... yeah... my cat did that too and it's really a small cat. Other than that it works flawlessly and we've never had any problems.
I was pleasantly surprised at the value and swift delivery of this product. It's already one of my all time faves no contest there. It makes shopping with amazon a pleasure and a recommendation.
"I've used Acutane, Proactiv, and various cleansers and this antibac acne wash is the best for my skin. I can tell a difference when I don't use it and I make it a point to wash my face with it at least once a day. Amazing product."
"This toy is just great. We have two 4 month old kittens, a brother and sister. Our boy took to Da Bird immediately. He leaps, runs, flips, and basically goes crazy over this toy. Our favorite is when he gets it in his mouth and starts growling, warning anyone near by that the bird is HIS.Even though our boy LOVES this toy, our girl doesn't seem to care about it at all! She sits by passively watching as her brother goes crazy over it. But I guess that's how it is with cat toys - you win some, you lose some.I definitely recommend this toy, though - if your cat reacts like our little boy does, it is COMPLETELY worth the money. :)"
"Last christmas, I recieved this from Japan and yesterday, I recieved another one from Toys'R'Us. Its freaking awesome!! It can transform from Zords mode to Dragon Mode and to Megazord Mode, an awesome transformer vibe. It's freaking great!!! Get it for your collection while supplies last!!"
"These walkie talkies are not so good. Only a child who REALLY loves Strawberry Shortcake might like these. My daughter who is now 6 got these when she was 5 (maybe 4) and still likes them but I can't stand playing with them with her. There's A LOT of feedback and at times I can barely hear what she's saying (and she can't hear me much either.) We have to stand within 5-10 feet of each other to get as optimal a sound as we can. There's one button that is like a call button (makes a beeping sound) but it really only comes through when the receiver has their walkie talkie open (I thought it would be fun for it to ""call"" the other walkie talkie when it's closed to warn the receiver that they have a call coming in....Nope...so I don't get the point of the ""call"" button when it's only used when someone has their walkie talkie already open and in listening mode.) My daughter has been a HUGE Strawberry Shortcake fan for 2 years (just starting to come out of it) so she doesn't mind them. But if she knew how good other walkie talkies are (i.e. what she's missing out) I'm sure she'd put these aside quickly."
"This is an awesome fragrance. I would say it's more of a day-time perfume, because it has a very light, clean, citru-sy smell, which I absolutely love. I've had many people ask me what fragrance I'm wearing. 5 Stars."
"The bowls especially are extremely beautiful--while they come with a nice black bag, you will want to display them on your mantle. Stones are also good."
"We ""furminate"" our cat daily and notice a significant decrease of cat fur on furniture. The amount of hair removed is astounding! His coat is shinier and healthier looking, too."
"My 6-month-old son loved this toy, and adores it still at 9 months. Nothing holds his attention longer. The previous review by J-lo described this toy perfectly. This is BY FAR the best toy value I've found."
"I also wanted the superior European version of Milk. Same story with product switched for international version without Vitamin E in a lilac colored pump bottle. Am in the process of getting a product return authorization from them. They do not have any more of the German stuff. Drat! Usually, European versions of cosmetic products, like Clinique, are inferior to US. Not in this case."
"My 11 year old received this for his birthday. He had been saving money for an ipod and we bought this to go along with it. He can't get enough of this toy. It sits on his desk and sways its head when he is doing homework and it makes the cutest noises. Even my 5 year old will sit for hours and watch it. It's smaller than I thought it would be, but seems pretty durable and works really well. Quite a hit for that in between age!"
"My puggle and cocker-jack jump right away into this cozy car seat/bed when I open the car door. The cocker-jack always stood with his front paws on the middle console so he could watch out the window. Much safer now - the bed is very high - he can see out even when laying down.The strap between the seat belt and dog is very limiting in movement. I rigged my own harness and strap to give more mobility.Beware...the car seat/bed takes up 3/4 of the back seat of my Honda Civic.It's very visable to everyone outside the car, especially when the dogs are in, but even empty.Washable - no problem fitting it back on the foam body after the dryer."
"This toy is one of my 8 month old's favorites.He has been playing with it daily for 3 months now.The only problem is that after chewing on the dog's ear over these months, the sensor does not work anymore, thus we have lost a few songs and games!"
My son loved it for his 5th birthday and he has already learned so much. The game teaches math skills and they get to race. All a kid would want.
This card holder is wonderful when playing multi-deck games or even when playing games with one deck at a large table. It allows you to take the cards to the player rather than having players reach halfway across a table to draw or discard. Love it!
"This is a good harness. It fits my 11-lb Yorkie (he's larger than average, but not fat). When we travel, I use this harness with the Kurgo automobile zip line so he can go back and forth in the back seat. The harness allows me to pick him up and put him in or out of my car easily. It is easy to put on and remove with just one buckle on his back."
These animals are very cute. They are detailed and great to hide in kids pockets. The only complaint I have is the scale. The kitten is the same size as the calf! Odd.
"My daughter loves this puzzle!I was having a difficult time finding puzzles for her. The chunky, wooden puzzles were way too easy and the regular puzzles were way to hard. This puzzle is just right. There are 8 puzzles"
"Egyptian Goddess is such a lovely exotic fragrance. It has the ability to unleash the goddess in you as it delights the senses. My body chemistry seems to blend better with musky aromatics so this is the perfect fragrance for me. Once I glide the applicator on my wrists, inside my elbows and the pulse points of my neck it tends to transport me to beautiful places(I adore the roll on applicator). I consider it a fragrance that whispers, yet loud enough to be heard without being offensive."
This product does not make you hair grow at all. Im so freakin mad it is such a lie it makes your hair grow..........IM SOOOOOOOOOOOO MADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
"Don't be cheap dish out the extra $5 and get something that is going to get the job done right.This is very cheap looking, but it is cheap so how can i complain. I don't even know if I can call the material it is made out of plastic.It doesn't heat up past luke warm. I like my curling iron to get so hot I can't touch it, this one is so warm I can just leave my finger on it without getting burned.I'm pretty sure if I got any hotter than it already does the material it is made of would melt.The barrel itself is very short. It's like a travel/mini iron.At it's best this is just a brush with a cord on it.I gave it two stars because ""you get what you pay for""Maybe this is why I am the only one to give this product a review everybody else knew better."
"I used the Litter Maid self cleaning box for a year until the motor burned out. Even before then, I had to clean out the rake once a day and pry up clumps that had stuck to the bottom of the litter box. When the motor died I took a chance on the Omega Paw, or as I call it, the Roly Poly Litter Box. In hindsight, I wish I had gotten the larger size, but the regular works just fine. I was concerned that, in spite of the outward appearance, the actual litter area is about the size of a shoebox. However, my two cats adjusted to it in less than a day. No more rakes to clean. A smart tap on the base after you roll it, and any clumps that are stuck drop right off. No wasted litter, no litter kicked out of the box, no scoops to mess with. I took the advice of a previous review and reinforced the clamps with binder clips. This is WELL WORTH the price!!!I should add, when my mother bought one she couldn't get it to work right. Every time she rolled it, half the litter was dumped in the receptacle. It turned out she was rolling it too fast, and too far. all it takes is a gentle roll just past the perpendicular. I've had this for many months now and still can't say enough good things about it. Greatest invention in the world!"
"I was very pleased with the construction and quality of this collar. It performs better than I hoped for. I recommend this collar to anyone who needs to keep track of their dog at night. My little dog tends to get around into dark places I cannot see her and instead of panicing or worrying she has run off, I can calmly keep track of her and our walks are much less worrysome."
"Prozyme is necessary for my dog's good health. He has it sprinkled on his food every day, every meal. What a wonderful product!"
"As a first-time player of Clue in general, I found that for such a seemingly simple concept, it had WAY too many damned rules. It took us over 15 minutes to read the instructions, and even after we took the time to do so, the instructions made no sense.Overall, it was not a very exciting game. Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that we were a large group (9-10), but it was nothing to write home about in general.The Disney aspect doesn't add anything to the game itself, also."
"We have 3 cute cats, but their life line was growing short until I found ""ssscat."" It keeps them from the most foul behavior they were trying to make a everyday event. From the first spray of gas they ran and now won't come near it. Thank God for the product that brought peace to my life and kept my marriage and cats together."
"We have a 15lb female 2 yr old Pug. She is a handful. I've trained many Labradors and have had a challenge keeping this little dog off the dinner table. We turn our back and she moves the chairs around to get on top the table to snack on whatever could be left. After trying a number of things, we finally bought this collar. We set it pretty low and tested it...nothing. We put in on 5, watched out dog try to get on the table and ZAP! she jumped right off. We have kept the collar on her and use it when she nears the table. We use the sound feature for other training, like barking, and it works well.My suggestion is to buy extra batteries as they run low quickly. Also be sure to buy the collar size closest to your dog size. The small one we bought was still really big.It works!"
"The little toys are cute and my 4 month old loves them, but the top of the fishbowl is too narrow to ""spill"" the toys out as the name implies. In fact, I had a hard time getting the toys out through the top. Maybe an older baby can get them out. The toys are machine washable, which is a plus, and they make cute sounds so they keep my baby's attention."
"Bought this for my 2 year old son so we could play balence games. He doesn't understand that yet, but he loves puting the cylinders on (manual dexterity anyone??) and we count them when we clean up. The pieces are just the right size for his hands and he likes just setting them all over the table and ignoring the clown too. It's gotten to the point that I have to hide the thing or he refuses to do anything else (like sleep)."
"My cats all love these, but they're constantly falling apart. (The fish, not the cats.:) I've mended them so many times that there's no more fabric left to mend! I suggest buying the bananas or cigars instead. Those hold up much better!"
"This is a swell carrier. It was recommended for cats under 9 lbs. My cat is 8.5 lbs. and it is a bit small but she does fit in it for short trips to the vet and home again. She is happier with this carrier compared to the hard cat carrier. And, she can see through it much better so she doesn't feel so confined. I would recommend the medium size for longer trips."
"My small mixed-breed guy loves these. Of course, he loves most everything, but this is a treat that doesn't put the pounds on him the way others do."
"Nice and heavy cat scratcher. None of my cats will use the top of it, but two of them use the bottom. I still have hope that they will use the whole Scrather, but I am please with my purschase. Thanks"
"Complete rip off, this thing is a piece of junk save yourself the $4.44 and buy a $0.99 clicker from your local pet store that actually works. Better yet, buy 4 of them for less than the price of this one and don't worry about losing or breaking them because you have 3 spares!!!"
"I bought this lion 3 years ago and I love it. In fact I even made a replica of Pride Rock from The Lion King and put him on it. The artist who made this model should be proud. He really got the detail everywhere, even the tail. I highly recommend this model for anyone who loves lions like me. LONG LIVE THE KING!!!"
I had recieved this game for Christmas and I find it quite enjoyable. The concept of the game is very simple:You slide the box forward and then back again revealing two tiles. You must think of a word that begins with the first letter and ends with the second. ExampleLetters are:A LWord Possible
"I originally used the product in a Kerastase salon. In the salon it was not for sale. I was thrilled to find that I could purchase it elsewhere. While it is quite expensive, it is worth every penny for helping color damaged hair repair and renew. All the Kerastase products are excellent. They all make your hair shiny, beautiful and feeling healthy. I highly recommend this product."
"This is the best Chewbacca figure yet. In addition to many points of articulation, the figure towers over the others by at least an inch, the first figure in the appropriate scale. A must have!"
This is a good catbox that eliminates 99% of manual scooping. Once in a while (every week) I still do manual scooping to catch the finer debris that the screen doesn't get. But overall I am really satisfied. I have 2 cats that have no problem using it and it is really easy to clean.
its difficult to rate dog food. i guess you look at the ingredients and if your dog eats it then its good.well the ingredients were great but my dog didnt like it and its pretty pricey. thats all i can say.
"I had purchased a toy like this one at a store and my dog loved it. When I saw the same toy (I thought) online I decided to purchase a couple of extras. I was very disappointed to find that the ""tennis ball attached to the tail was a flocked cardboard sphere which my dog ate in the first 5 minutes. This was a total waste of money! Sae your money and don't make the same mistake I did"
"Donkey race is the fave, that and the Over the hedge version of tetris and pacman are fun too. Graphics are basic but hey what do you want for under $10 bucks?"
This product is very gentle almost to gentle i have very sensitive skin and it does not hurt at all. However that being said it is ok for already light hair but after 5 treatments to the same area over a week most hairs are very light but very dark ones are not getting lighter at all.
"Me encanta su olor, es muy fresco y algo citrico. Es sin duda mi favorito."
"First of all, I want to say that I've been using this product for a little over a week and I'm already seeing my stretch marks fade away. I've had two pregnancies back to back and I never used anything on my stomach so I got really bad stretch marks and this product is working great. One thing about the product is that you really have to be dedicated to put the time and effort so it can work the way it's suppose to work. I read in other reviews that this product is old and that's why it comes in a tanish color. Well, ladies don't believe everything you read because unless you do research like I did you will know that, that's a lie. Today I went to Macy's and saw this exact same product come in a 2oz tube and I opened the tester to see the color since people want to say it's old and guess what, the one at Macy's was tanish too. Ladies don't know that every cream comes in different colors because every cream is used for different purposes. I'm really looking forward to continue using this amazing product and see my results at the end because so far so good."
Every other Sunday since last Christmas we have played this game after dinner! My boys ages 10 and 7 have so much fun with this game. My brother and sister-in-law come over and we sit around the table and have a blast! Sometimes the games take hours. We have found that the longer it takes the more fun it is!What a great variation on a classic!This is a real blast and Oh so much fun!Purchase this and play it with your children!
"After trying a number of collars for my two medium sized dogs (one basenji mix and one cattledog mix), I was about to give up walking them when I found the gentle leader's collar. Walking two dogs that weigh almost 40 - 50 lbs each was quite the ordeal when they decided (as they often did) to go in different directions. I've notice a few negative reviews around the fit, etc. I watched the dvd prior to trying it and didn't seem to have any difficulting finding a good fit for my dogs. Each were trained separately on the collars and the difference between walking them now is like night and day. We now take them regularly to parks and have even gone on several vacations. Walking with the collars on is easy, and the dogs can easily open their mouths and drink, bark, or take treats. Again, I'm only speaking from my own experience, but the dogs are very eager to put on the collars anytime we go out now... and what used to be an ordeal is now a pleasure. Just my two cents. Thanks."
The Conair Blackbird is the best non-professional hair dryer out there. Multiple settings and 2000 watts make for fast drying without burning!
This item took a long time to arrive but I have enjoyed it. The lid snaps really tight and it holds the pee pad securely in place. I purchased the same brand pee pads and they do not leak or smell so I am satisfied.
"My first impression open opening the package (and smelling the products, naturally), was ""This smells like allergies!""Granted, that's not anyone's fault but mine, since I bought this having a pretty vague idea of what lavender, in particular, smelled like. I'm also allergic to a disturbing amount of flora, so to be fair, anything that smells vaguely earthy and plant-ish gives me a similar reaction. Given the titular ""lavender mint,"" I was expecting something of a cross between various Bath & Body Works Lotions and my toothpaste. Not so. I think I have a decent idea of what smells minty, and this didn't smell minty at all to me, so I can only assume it smells like lavender, in which case I apparently am not a particular fan of lavender. (Again, not anyone's fault but mine.) The scent isn't unpleasant, it's just not something I'd pick out.As to the scent being cloying, I found that I could really only smell it as my hair dried (which admittedly takes a while as my hair is waist-length and I very rarely blow dry it). After my hair was dry, however, I had to specifically grab a hunk of hair and place it under my nose and inhale to be able to smell much of anything, which is not something I'm in the habit of doing, but I guess if you sniff your own hair frequently, it could get annoying if you're not a fan of the scent. As far as I'm aware, no one else could smell it on me, either, which is good, because I'm not of the school of ""well, I like this scent, so naturally everyone within a ten foot radius will want to smell me.""Regarding the supposed tingly feeling some reviewers did/didn't get - the only tingly feeling I felt while using this product was in my arms trying to work this puppy into a lather. My previous shampoo lathered at the slightest provocation, so at first I was pretty determined to make this do the same. It didn't work. If you find copious amounts of suds necessary for a pleasant showering experience, you're going to be sorely disappointed with this product. It lathers, certainly, but relatively minimally.Once I got over the disappointment of not being able to create a bubble mountain atop my head and rinsed, I found that this shampoo left my hair feeling quite clean. I wash my hair every day (yes, yes, I know - hairdressers everywhere just died a little inside). It's not something I'm willing to stop, however, which allows me to find pretty quickly just how moisturizing (or un-moisturizing) a particular product is. I wouldn't say that this product dried out my hair, but it didn't leave it looking like a Pantene commercial, either (I'm not endorsing Pantene here - there's a reason I don't use their hair care products, but the models in their hair commercials always have gorgeous, shiny hair).I'd highly advise anyone using the conditioner to leave it in for as many minutes as you can. Even though the bottle doesn't say to, let it sit in your hair for a bit. The few times where I was in a bit of a rush and basically applied conditioner and immediately rinsed it out left my hair feeling very dry. However, leaving it in for multiple minutes while I carried on with my shower left my hair feeling deliciously smooth and silky when I rinsed it out (some of this silkiness was lost as soon as I my hair started to dry, unfortunately.) On the whole, my hair seems slightly less frizzy than it was before I started using this product. The main difference I've noticed is that it definitely is softer - particularly at the ends.On the whole, I like this product, but once I finish the (rather large) bottles, I'll probably try something else. It works, and more or less seems to do what it claims, but certainly doesn't do anything beyond that."
"This started working great; the dog responds very well to just the tone after only a couple small initial shocks. However, after having this for about 7 months, it has stopped working. So now I'm being forced to find another one."
I was initially frightful to buy from online but when I received the product I will now continue to save money using this site for my Frontline Plus.
I like the perfume (smell) of this cologne. It is light and fruitful a bit bitter and the best for everyday use. I am happy to find it in your shops...
"Our cat had to take it for her arthritis. She now acts as if she had no problem. She runs, jumps and plays like a young cat."
"This tool puts all others to shame for cat grooming. It almost seems like it's razoring the hair right off. To prove it wasn't, I tried it on my non-shedding dog - and little to no hair came out. My cat was pretty good letting me comb him, but it becomes a little addictive, so after about 10min he wanted a break from me! Can't say enough about it...should be on Oprah's Favorite Things list...some body send her one!!"
"I use this for hand therapy and it is excellent. It heats up quickly, is easy to get my hands into, and comes with mitts which make the heat stay longer on my hands."
"This blade does not shave as well as the old blade, which is almost 50 years old. I had broken a couple of teeth on the old one and was happy I could replace it. However, the new one does not hold a candle to the old one."
the vet recommended this product because my dachshund's fur behind his ears seemed to be thinning. It worked great plus adds shine to his coat. He loves it on his food each morning. This was an excellent price too.
"this product is designed to make washing a pet easier, yet the faucet side leaked so badly the human would be the wet one.otherwise, i think the product is good concept."
"This product is just what it says it is. It's a Fribee-like disc in a fleece container that you microwave. It doesn't say as warm as long as advertised, but it does stay warm for a number of hours. My animals don't sleep on it as it is hard, but they will sleep near it, which works because the heat radiates if you are close to it. I've used it myself to warm my feet at night."
"I absolutly love this product! This product makes bathing so easy and I really don't get wet. Elevating the dog is such a great idea. The time it takes me to bathe my dog has been cut in half. Wow, I'm very very impressed. If you have a dog you must get the Booster Bath! I save so much $$$ by not having to go to the groomer all the time. I LOVE my Booster Bath!"
"I absolutely love Settlers. When I saw this deal, I imediately hit ""add to cart."" I saved over $20.00 buying this bundle. I enjoy being able to build ships and mine gold. If you are stuck playing the Base game, consider expanding because it will liven up the party. Overall I give this expansion three thumbs up.Ps"
"We absolutely love this organizer. We installed ours in Dec and it is now July and it is still holding up perfectly. And we have a ton of bath toys, so many in fact that I am planning on purchasing a bug pod to go along with the frog pod! A must purchase for any childs bathroom!"
I use the Olay Regenerist Anti-aging night resurfacing elixir at night and it is a relatively inexpensive anti-aging mousturizer. During the day I use Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration regenerating cream and they both keep my face smooth and soft. I used to use Este Lauder but now prefer Oil of Olay.
I purchased this for my 5 month old Olde English Bulldogge puppy - she is a large puppy and LOVES to chew! She destroys MOST items - but not the Kong items! She LOVES her Crow Toy! It comes stuffed with a large squeaky tennis ball and even comes with a spare in case they puncture the original - it's been a month and it's still WHOLE and Squeaking - I Love how it keeps her happy! Buy this if you have a Large jawed puppy or dog that loves to chew - you will be SO GLAD that you did!
We're now on my 5th or 6th of these. My dog plays rough
"I have lots of fine, slightly wavy but mostly straight shoulder-length hair, grown out from a chin-length bob. I LOVE this styler! I wash my hair at night, let it air dry, and style in the morning with either a flat iron or big hot rollers. This morning I just used the Conair while my hair was slightly damp, and my hair came out great. I used it on the ""4"" tension setting, which is supposed to be for thick hair, but the instructions suggested starting with that setting, so I did. I honestly can't tell a lot of difference in tension on the different settings, plus it's VERY difficult to see the numbers (they're at the base of the knob). I only used the low setting, so I'm anxious to see how well it holds today. I will try the high heat setting next time. It held my hair well without pulling, and is very easy to use. It really is just like brushing your hair! I held the ends of my hair with my left hand as suggested. I puchased mine locally as I wanted to be able to return it easily, but will probably now purchase another one from Amazon while it's only $24 so I'll have a spare!"
My dog LOVES these cookies. They smell just like a peanut butter brownie. I got an entire package of these for a sample from Walmart website. I will buy these if the price is reasonable.
"My lab mix will destroy ordinary Nylabones and other dog toys in minutes, two of these keep her entertained for months. Just watch out, my dog loves to carry one in her mouth and drop it on my toes or stab my shin with a pointy end."
"This is a fun set of candles for those fans of 'Nightmare Before Christmas.' They are about what you would expect from small, round candles. They burn fine, but because of their round shape, they really do need to be in an appropriate candle holder so they don't roll away while burning if they are bumped. Of course, if they are in a candle holder (something with sides, again, so they don't roll) they lose some of their visual appeal. As such, these make for better decoration if left unburnt. One note relating to storage of holiday decorations"
"With all the glowing commendations for this product, I figured I couldn't go wrong by purchasing it. Wrong, wrong, wrong. I followed the directions; I didn't leave it on longer than 8 minutes, and I didn't use it more than once a week. I rinsed with cool water and used a noncomodogenic moisturizer afterwards. I didn't lay out in the sun. Now, 6 or 7 weeks later, my skin has never been in such terrible condition. Where I was only having mild breakouts before, my face now resembles that of my acne scarred adolescence. I cringe when I look in the mirror. Please, save yourself some trouble and DO NOT buy this product."
"Game is fun, but is slow in trying to choose numbers."
I purchased this Leapster rechargable for my 5 year old daughter who never lays down her Leapster hardly ever!! She is getting very good at writing straight line for her numbers and letters. The educational games are wonderful and the rechargable system is an excellent buy!! She especially loves the plug in accessory that comes with this kit. She can sit and play her Leapster as long as she wants and never worry about a battery shortage. Thanks so much for this product!!! I am a very satisfied customer!
"Straight from the typewriter of the Above to the playroom of your son, teach your children well with this fabulous book! My son is leapfrogging over all the pagans in his kindergarten class!"
"We bought this four our son and daughter because the reviews of the big one say they are garbage any more. It is a christmas present, so I cannot comment on the toy itself yet."
"I bought this elite model because I adopted 2 cats from the shelter and do not want to be a slave to the litter box. It seemed alright at first, the first week. But, I have to scoop every day and empty the bin every day. If I miss one day it will over flow. I don't know how anyone could only empty this once a week, not even for just one cat.I am writing this review to save you some sleep. It has a loud motor. The rake gives up when raking and keeps trying to clean the box but the clumping litter sometime makes it stop. It keeps trying... all night... until I get up at 2 am to scoop poo. Really!! I don't think any other litter box will wake you up to scoop poo! It doesn't matter how high you fill the line, it doesn't really clean all the box, you need to scoop every day.The rake sometimes pushes the poop backwards after in goes between the rake and then hides it. Somehow, there is always litter leaking onto the tiles under the box.This was a large investment, so I need to make it work for a while, so here are the tricks to live with this box until you can get a better one.1- use a plastic grocery bag (without any holes) to line the waste receptacle. This way you can switch out the bag every day instead of switching out the receptacle.2- keep a hand vac right next to the box so you can vacuum up all the loose litter that somehow gets everywhere every day. It makes easier clean up, but you need to vacuum around the box and under the receptacle every day when you change it or it gets everywhere.3- make sure you use clumping litter. If it is loose, it doesn't clean, if it is really hard the motor isn't strong enough to push it. So, you loose no matter what. I have found that fresh step keeps the odor under control better than other litters.4- use two sided tape on the lid of the bin on the outside, because the cats like to scratch it open to try to get to the poo in the bin to try to cover it and will break it open with their claws. IF you have 2 sided tape there for a week, they give up ripping it open.5- Also line the receptacle lid with a plastic bag. Sometimes the poo that gets raked into the bin gets stuck to the lid and it is gross and makes you replace the bin lid. I have refused to buy more bins since the cost for the box was crazy high.Good luck. For now, cleaning the litter box is the part time job I have after working all day and going to school at night. I am a complete litter slave until they come up with something that actually works."
"personally, I am mad, I am a kid who wanted the ""video now, black and white version"" so bad for christmas last year. I begged, and Pleaded, and finally got it (sure my mom told me soon it was going to be in color, but I didn't believe her, how wrong I was). Soon enough, it came, I felt so bad for making my mom go and spend about 40$ on the ""video now black and white"" and then they make it in color, why didn't they just make it in color first, they wanted to rip us off and spend our money! Now the screen is bigger, you don't have to buy a light (which I already made my mom by me one, for the black and white version) and it's in color!!! PERIOD!!! that's it, I was so mad! I am going to try and sell my BLK and WHT version, save up some more money for the color, I'm not going to make my mom spend even more money on another toy, and to this day I still feel bad.P.S. I do hope that you do not have to buy seperate disks, can't you use the old discs to play on the colored version?!?!?HOPEFULLY!Sincerely,Unknown"
"I would definitely buy this again; my two cats (medium-length fur) got fleas for the first time ever & I thought I'd try this comb. It got good reviews and now I know from first-hand experience. This comb grabs dead & live fleas & flea feces.. which disolves back into blood in water by the way.. gross yet interesting.. Definitely have the soapy water right next to you. I combed my cats on the white kitchen floor to see any escaped fleas, but only 2 fell on the floor, the rest (about 8) were well stuck in the comb.. Having fleas in the house is a huge hassle!"
"Both my seven year old and four year old enjoy this toy. While the seven year old enjoys the interactive games and word descriptions, the four year old enjoys listening to the stories.The variety of interactive books is wonderful and if you manage to find them on sale even better. The Leap Pad is a perfect alternative to the computer which is less mobile and hard on the eyes."
"I bought this about 2 weeks ago and so far it hasn't done anything special for me. I was looking for an organic product that would be safe for sensitive skin but also do the job. Well so far, the product has not given me a rash or made me breakout which is a VERY GOOD THING, but I don't really see a great difference in my skin after using it. My face feels kind of slimy after using the face wash and then stings a bit when using the toner. The moisturizer is pretty good, but after an hour or so my face gets dry around the cheeks and forehead again. I don't know maybe the change in weather hasn't helped, so I won't say its a bad product, just not what my skin needs at the moment."
This is a very badly made item. If I could have rated this a NEGATIVE 2 stars I would have! I plugged it in and my daughters used it TWO TIMES. It sounds as though it is shorting out. It will not come on at all now. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this to anyone! Save your money. If I still had the box I would have returned it. I will not buy from this manufacturer again.
"...and I can't believe I just put it on my cats. I feel SO bad. They immediately ran around the house like maniacs, itching the back of their neck (probably because it burns!). I just read that Cinnamon Oil is a CAT REPELLANT...not only an insect REPELLANT. I've read so many reviews of this product since I put it on my cats and I'm not looking forward to the vet visits I will have to make this week because of it. I hope the hair grows back!"
"We purchased these tabs after seeing evidence that our newly-adopted kitty had tapeworms. After following the directions carefully regarding dosage for a kitten, we administered the meds, saw no bad side effects, and all evidence of tapeworms was gone after just one dose. We subsequently took our kitten to the vet for a wellness check-up, and the vet confirmed our belief"
"D&G; Light is such a soft, beautiful and flowery fragance. It reminds of of a warm, sunny day. It smells fresh and cleanand oooh so soft. My only dislike is that it does not linger long enough and you can't over do it or it becomes a little nauseating.This scent contains a blend of"
"I love this product! I can finally take my dog outside without a leash, normally he would run away as soon as I opened the door, but now he listens and stays in my yard. I only had to actually shock him 4 times, and now I just hit the warning and he comes running to my side. I highly recommend this product especially if you have an alpha dog as I do."
Great product! Worth the price. A little noisy at first but you get used to it. It took my cats about a week to start using it so I would suggest keeping their old litter box in the room and do not clean it. Eventually they will start using the Litter Robot because they will get tired of a messy box.
"I don't know what it is about this simple little toy but cats love it! Maybe it is the erratic movement, but I have had so much luck with these. Even my very haughty cat would chase this; when we were keeping in a cabinet she would hear the cabinet door open and dart from wherever she was to go and get in on the fun! It is not expensive so get one of these for your cat!"
Re
"I purchased this item in good faith. I've been using this fragrance for years. However, not sure if it is because it was an old bottle, but it did not smell anything like a bottle I purchase at Dillards or Macys. Got what I paid for, but not happy with end result."
"The only problem is the very ridiculous shipping and handling costs... You would do much more business if you were less greedy in overcharging shipping. You have to figure out a better and less expensive way, and your probablility for more business will increase significantly in many other items. I have been dissuaded many times from buying something because of the excessive shipping charges."
"Hmmm.....wasn't that impressed with the overall effectiveness with helping my son's cradle cap. His doctor recommended it, but I think it caused my son's hair to fall out. I'm sure it works well on adult heads though"
"Fantastic product and a great seller. I will only use this vendor, as they have the best customer service and best prices."
"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift and it was a big disappointment. The fan is tiny, would not be able to be used to actually cool anyone off. It is also extremely loud, you cannot even hear yourself speak when it is on. There are no speed sets on this fan, just off and on. The light up feature is pretty neat, my daughter wanted to keep it just for that. It has a little remote and you can program the fan to say a short word or phrase, but it does have to be on to show the word. I would not waste my money on this item, it will not be used. My daughter liked it for a few minutes and now it just sits there in her room. Also, my ten year old niece received one of these and in trying to cut the package open herself, cut her hand open and needed six stiches! It is a very difficult package to open and should not be done be children!"
"Thought I would review this product, as we've been using the collar for about 2 weeks now. Lucky is a 7 yr old yellow lab (my girlfriends). We've just moved into a house together and noticed the dog was extremely thirsty, especially when we arrived home. Doctor gave her a clean bill of health, so on a hunch we decided to video the dog while we were gone and it turns out she was barking nonstop while we were away (8 hours when left that long). Having spent the last 5 years in a large house with a lot of space between the houses, my girlfriend couldn't completely discount the notion that Lucky has been doing this for years. Lucky would be barking when she would arrive home each day, but she attributed it to the automatic garage door opening (the preferred way to enter that house).Well, the new place is a large row home in the city. Even though the neighbors haven't contacted us via note or face to face, I'm sure we are not held in high regards at this point. I know they can hear her. We tried crating her, which she is very familiar with, but that would only grant us about 1 hour of quiet before the bombardment of anxiety filled yelps and barks would commence relentlessly till we arrived back home. We decided to go with the Premier GentleSpray Citronella Anti-Bark Dog Collar because it wasn't a shock collar, and it would work while we were away. When we are home, Lucky only barks to alert us of someone at the door, or loud unusual noises.It was easy to set up, load, fit and we were in business in under 5 minutes. We decided to go out for dinner and thought we'd give the dog about 2 1/2 - 3 hours of time to get acquainted with our the system. While the laptop video ran, we had a great dinner up the street and drinks with friends. We arrived home to see what happened while we were gone via the laptop video. After we left, Lucky paced nervously back and forth, hit the collar box on a wooden chair arm and got sprayed for no reason. Although it was funny, it's not teaching her anything. So after a few minutes of confusion, she started barking for us to return only to receive a blast in front of her face of citronella spray. She looked around trying to figure out who just sprayed her. She changed locations in the room and tried barking again. Blast #2. Walked to another corner of the room, bark, blast #3. upstairs, bark, blast #4. How about a howl instead, blast #5. She then retired to her crate to avoid this unpleasant phenomenon and was quiet till our return. All of this took place in the first 20 minutes of our leaving the house.That was about 2 weeks ago. We've stopped setting up the webcam video while we are gone. Not only has Lucky stopped anxiety barking, but she seems much, much calmer now. The last couple of videos showed her wandering the house, sniffing around, goofing with the cats, and napping either in her crate (door open) or on her dog bed.It worked perfectly as advertised. She only wears it while we are away and we all are much happier."
"The product works, even for my 3-year old. The only down side is that you can taste it when eating finger foods, etc. It is definitely worth it for the money and I would suggest it to anyone who has a nail biting problem. I have never been happier with my nails and thank God for introducing me to Mavala!"
Great activity table. The legs aren't the most durable especially with our 11 month old son wanting to push it around.
"I think this is great. I bought it as a gift and am now buying another one for another Dr. Who fan because I liked it so much. I think they will have a lot of fun keeping it on their desks at work. They are both adults. I don't think it would be suitable for small children. I think the price was fine and the description states the size, so no surprise there."
"This perfume has a decent smell to it, and it arrived to me very quickly as well. I do wish that it had an actual lid to it as it would be easier to store."
"We love this card game version of Scrabble! It's fun with a group of six or eight folks, or with just two. Recently we had our second 'Quiddler Party' with eight friends,and had a ball -- again! Good to play with any age who likes to put words together."
"I used Buf Pufs for many years and loved them. Then I could no longer find them in stores. I had to purchase six of them from Amazon. Too expensive - Not happy about thatI've been using the first from that purchase for about a month now. They are not made of the same stuff as they were in the past. It has flattened out and seems almost as if it is disintegrating. The old Buf pufs lasted for months - six months, easily. This one is ready to be tossed.Why would they mess with a quality product and also make it difficult to purchase? Women need to exfoliate their skin. Men exfoliate when they shave. Buf pufs were the best.I purchased one of the generic ones from CVS and it is a poor immitation.I guess I'm pretty lucky if my biggest complaint in life is I'm not happy with my Buf puf - I can handle the big things in life - it's the little things that bug the heck out of me. . . .Jan"
This is absolutely the best shedding tool I have ever used. I recommend it highly.
"This is an execellant company, and product. The service is GREAT. I encourage any one to give this company a try."
It kind of works but it is not oderless. I have to keep a window open next to where the cat is. Kind of defeats the purpose.
"This guy is great. He's fun, full of information and trivia, and has an incredibly funny personality. The room guard and phone were my favorites. Using an MP3 player with him was great too!"
"FURminator Large Yellow deShedding Tool with 4-Inch EdgeThis product works great on our yellow lab. She sheds a lot, and this works just like it says. Really cuts down on the hair in the house! The only thing you have to watch out for, is use the product just like the instructions say - don't go over and over the same area, or you can irritate their skin. Also be careful on sensitive areas."
"Nice design and very well-made. Glad to find anything made in the USA these days. However, I wouldn't recommend this for a Pug, which is the breed for which I purchased it. The strap that runs from the chest to the belly is too long for a Pug, but would be fine for a larger dog. I had to get the 14""-24"" size as Pugs are very broad-chested, but having the larger girth means having a longer chest strap. The rear loop that goes around the dog should be just an inch or so behind the front legs; on this one it's much further back. The causes the chest strap to ""bunch up"" when the dog sits, so having all that extra room means the dog gets his front feet through the neck loop quite often. I would definitely recommend this for a big dog, but not for a stout dog like a Pug."
"I love the adult version of this game, and the kids I work with love this version!It teaches some vocabulary and reasoning, and can be a phenomenal ice breaker in a daycare or school-aged care setting. This is the most valuable board game/card game our afterschool program had. If you own one board game for your kids, have this be the one.(the only downside is that it needs three or more players.)"
This item is a nice size( not to big or small) and is pretty durable. My pets love it and anyone who buys it won't be dispointed.
"Can't say enough about this fountain. It is very quiet,easy to clean and best of all my cat loves it. he has never like drinking from a water bowl I had to turn bath tub on for him to get drinks now he drinks more which I am sure is healthier for him.the delivery was fast and packed very good."
"This was a birthday gift for an autistic boy, and he loves it. His parents are having a good time earning points online when their child is not playing, so what does that tell you!! I am glad I chose this as a gift and would suggest their toys to anyone."
So pleased to have found these Dog Biscuits. The company states they are at all our local markets however that is NOT TRUE! Grateful to this site! They came faster than expected which was also to my delight. Thank You!!!
"A spin off of the original monoploy using all the same concepts with Nintendo properties, chance and community chest, and playing pieces. Great fun for the family."
"Hola!Conoc&iacute; este perfume en 1998 y desde entonces lo estaba buscando. En Espa&ntilde;a ya no lo venden y me alegr&eacute; cuando lo encontr&eacute; por internet, as&iacute; que lo compr&eacute; sin dudar. Es justo tal y como lo recordaba"
"I have hair down to my waiste, so quality shampoos are very important for me. I was having problems with a dry, itchy/flakey scalp, so I tried several products (including one medicated shampoo), but nothing really seemed to help. Finally, I found the Jason Tea Tree Oil shampoo, and it has worked wonderfully!I think it is best if you actually follow the instructions on the bottle - it directs the user to do a quick, non-lathery ""pre-wash"" to clean the scalp and then follow up with a rich, lathery wash to remove excess dirt that didn't get washed the first time. I have actually found this method to work pretty well.Really, I recommend any product from the Jason line of hair care. Not only does it leave your hair looking and feeling great, but it's also environmentally friendly!"
Remington used to make decent trimmers but now the cutters are so cheap that they're more likely to yank your hair out than trim it. Their customer service is horrendous. Never again.
"My parents Brittany Spaniel was on these the last few years of her life. She lived to be 19, and was walking around much better on these than she had been on the previous pills. And she loved the taste."
"I've owned cats for decades now and also do cat rescue and fostering (so I'm talking a lot of cats with a lot of preferences) - these are my favorite covered litter boxes by far! If you need a covered litter box then this is a great choice. I have 3 Large size boxes now (for my 2 permanent kitties).If put together properly and used properly then it works great at removing clumps while allowing the clean litter to remain in the box. It lessens the need to ""touch"" the dirty litter via scooping as all you need to do is remove and dump out the 'drawer'. I will say that it can take a little finesse to roll the box over, back to the neutral position, and then a little past neutral with a little shake to even the litter back out. But everyone who has ever seen/tried my Omega Paw litter boxes have become believers.Both of my current cats are also litter throwers so the shape and design of the box keeps the litter well contained (the boxes are nice and deep). If you are wondering whether to buy the regular size or the large size box, I recommend opting for the larger size as it gives your cat more room to move around. My two cats are large and lean, 12 and 14lbs - big guys - and they have plenty of room in the box.One caveat to any litter box - it still needs to be properly maintained. Meaning frequent scrub downs in addition to the clump removal. I find these Omega Paw boxes to be easy to take apart, wash, and put back together."
"I have been using this product; Pureology conditoner,for a couple of years and I love it. I have very dry hair, have used other conditioners, but this one works the best. It leaves my hair soft and manageable."
"I like the show very much, but the game had complicated directions for something so simple...it was made ""cheap"" and only one deck of cards so you go through the cards pretty fast...it is not very exciting to play. To play you place cardbboard pieces on other cardboard places that are marked how much money you are up to when you get a answer...whoopee :( No board involved...speaking ""bored"" that is how we were, so we just pulled from the deck asked each other questions.. That was fun and educational to a level. Too easy for most educated people. Too pricey for what you get, needs more cards and something else, Jeff maybe?! I will watch the show...I would not purchase this product for the money."
"I'd been avoiding this because I thought I was getting too old for these tween celebrities releasing fragrances. I don't mean to sound snobbish, but queuing up to buy something by Hilary Duff? No, thank you. I just couldn't resist it in the end though. I'm very pleased to say I was wrong to pre-judge.At first spay there is a pleasantly sweet fruit/floral top note of mangosteen fruit, mangosteen blossom & vanilla. Don't be put of by this, admittedly these top notes doesn't help peoples first opinions that WITH LOVE is a `younger' scent.It's the middle notes of exotic spices, chai latte, balsam, incense and wonderfully `creamy' amber milk that make WITH LOVE stand out from the crowd. I'm not sure how to describe the effect other then `warm'. The spices & incense aren't too heavy, but lend a wonderful scene of sophistication. Not something I expected!!The base of cocobolo wood and amber musk blends nicely with the middle notes, so the transition is very subtle.What can I say? I was really surprised by the depth of WITH LOVE, and think it should be marketed for people out of their teens. It's perfect for any time of the year, and for everyday wear, and evening or special occasions."
"I've been using this product for one week now. It has been working good on my underarms, but hasn't been working as well on my bikini area. I don't know how long it's suppose to take to start working though. I am going to try to continue to use it on my bikini area for another week or so to see if I see a difference."
Loreal always makes a quality product. the color was true to the color on the packaging. It was reasonably price and shipped quickly
"for the past 8 years, I struggled with my daughters hair, I have purchased every detangling product and FINALLY I found something that works.My daughter is biracial and has lots of curly hair, thick, medium long hair, I try to keep her hair short because many times I had to cut off the tangles to avoid hurting her, for the fist time EVER today was the first day I didn't spend over an hour trying to untangle her hair and hearing her scream (like I'm killing her) or with out any tears.I'm going to order a few more in case this one breaks."
"I think this fountain is certainly a nice way for my two dogs and cat to have fresh water available to them all day every day, with little maintenence from me. I will say, the only negatives I see are the look of it...it definitely looks cheap and really doesn't ""fit in"" with your typical home decor...also, if you have skiddish animals like my one dog, you have to be very patient...she wouldn't go near it the first 3 weeks! When all is said and done...great fountain for a lower price than buying it in the store...and as always, Amazon doesn't dissapoint!"
"First of all, in my opinion, the games for this system are great and my preschooler loves them. BUT I would not recommend this system for the following reasons:- The mouse is very awkward and doesn't work well in a child's hand. My son gets frustrated with it, which is a problem since most of the games require the mouse, not the keyboard.- I was highly disappointed to find that a power supply was not included with the system. You have to buy it separately, which was not disclosed on the box. It takes 4 C batteries, and it goes through them very quickly. For the price, a power supply should have been included.- I have a difficult time finding games for it. Target doesn't carry them at all. Walmart only has a few. And they're not cheap.Overall, I don't think this system is worth the cost. I wish I had done my research and purchased something different."
We have enjoyed playing Sequence for years. This time we bought it for an adult daughter who lives far away.
"My dog loves the squirrel but the squeaker broke in probably 10 minutes of play. She still likes to bite and carry it around, so I still gave it 2 stars."
"I have been using Adams Plus Flea & Tick mist for several years and I could nto be happier with the product. It is VERY effective and does what it says it does.I can't go any further without stating that the single star reviews shown here are unfair as the majority of them did not use the product correctly. If used correctly as stated on the label you will no better product on the market for flea & tick control.I use Frontline on my pets and I use Adams for the interior of my home in the springtime and in the fall when fleas seem to be more active. I spray along the base boards, corners, under the furniture, under tables, etc. and then where my pets sleep either in their beds or favorite spots. A couple of times I forgot to spray and I would notice a flea on one of my cats and the Adams came out and I sprayed and there was never a problem with fleas. Please remember that I DO NOT spray my pets with the Adams as they use Frontline and I just use it for the interior of my home.Also too, when I spray, there is an odor but it soon dissapates and does not linger. This is a great product but use it accorinding to the directions. As I stated above I have used it for years and it is very effective."
"Great product, and sprinkling it on top of her wet food - she eats it. Glad we found it. IDH"
"I really like this pen because it looks much better than the wire pens. It has rubber feet on the bottom so it won't slide or scratch your floor.I should have probably bought the extra two panels to make it larger, but my dog is very small so I don't think it will matter that much.I do wish the door came already installed in the panel but thats just me being lazy, it was easy to screw on!"
Purchased March '11... daily use... worked great! Finally died today and going to order another ... love this unit
